[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Patrick Kane. Please go ahead.","Patrick John Kane","Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's year-end 2012 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Porges, president and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Conti, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Randy Crawford, Senior Vice President and President of Midstream, Distribution and Commercial; and Steve Schlotterbeck, Senior Vice President and President of Exploration and Production. This call will be replayed for a 7-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 p.m. today. The telephone number for the replay is (412) 317-0088 with the confirmation code of 10006617. The call will also be replayed on our website for 7 days.","As you already know, this is the second quarter for EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, and its results are consolidated in EQT's results. There's a separate press release issued by EQM this morning, and there's a separate conference call today at 11:30, which creates a hard stop for this call at 11:25. If you are interested in the EQM call, the dial-in number is (412) 858-4600. In just a moment, Phil will summarize EQT's operational and financial results for the year-end 2012, which were released this morning. Then Dave will provide an update on our strategic operational matters. Following Dave's remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy and Steve will be available to answer your questions. But first, I'd like to point to a new table that was included in today's press release. This is a revenue recognition table found on Page 12 titled EQT Corporation Price Reconciliation and details the company's production revenue per product. This new table will replace the historically published price reconciliation table, which is also included on Page 5 of today's release. For your modeling purposes, we published the last 4 quarters using the new price reconciliation format on our website.","I would also like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed on today's press release under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed by the SEC and updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which were also on file with the SEC and available on our website, and in the company's Form 10-K for year-end December 31, 2012, when it's filed. Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2012 adjusted earnings of $1.49 per diluted share compared to $2.19 per diluted share in 2011. The high-level story for the year and the fourth quarter was very strong volume growth and lower unit cash costs in both the Production and the Midstream businesses, which was overcome throughout the year by significantly lower commodity prices.","Reported earnings for 2012 and 2011 were also impacted by several somewhat unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing results. With the exception of some items in the fourth quarter, which I will touch on in a moment, we have discussed these items on prior calls. Rather than to repeat those explanations, I will refer you to the detailed list on our non-GAAP reconciliation table on Page 7 of today's release. Operating cash flow was $832 million in 2012 or about $55 million lower than last year. Just as a reminder and Pat touched on it, the full-year 2012 results included 2 quarters of results from our MLP. As you will recall, EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corp. results and EQT recorded $13 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests or $0.09 per diluted share. So again, in short, 2012 was a strong operating year at EQT. Production volumes were 33% higher than last year. After gas-liquids volumes were 13% higher, Midstream gathering volumes were 30% higher and transmission capacity reservation revenues grew by 27%. However, commodity prices were 21% lower than last year, which again meant we were fighting an uphill battle on operating income and cash flow results throughout the year in 2011 -- for 2012 versus 2011. Fourth quarter 2012 adjusted earnings were $0.48 per diluted share. That compares to EPS of $0.59 in the fourth quarter of '11. A significantly higher production sales volumes were again overcome by lower commodity prices and higher absolute cost, along with $5.5 million of revenue reductions related to the capacity resell of the El Paso 300 line and $4.3 million of unrealized losses at Midstream, both of which we also experienced in prior quarters this year. The fourth quarter adjusted earnings number also excludes 4 items that did not occur in the prior quarters: a $23.3 million expense related to an interest rate hedge; approximately $4.5 million in transaction expenses associated with the sale of Equitable Gas; a $4.5 million lease impairment reported in exploration expense; and a positive $2.5 million regulatory reserve reversal at Midstream. Again, these items are detailed in the release. But before moving on, a moment on the interest rate hedge. During the third quarter of 2011, the company entered into an interest rate hedge in anticipation of refinancing $200 million of long-term debt scheduled to mature in November 2012. We subsequently entered into several transactions including the formation, an IPO, of EQT Midstream Partners, MLP and the announcement of a definitive agreement to sell Equitable Gas. These capital-raising transactions improved the company's current and projected liquidity position to such an extent that not only was there no need to refinance that 2012 debt. It became unlikely that any debt financing will be required in 2013 as well. So the interest rate hedge position was closed without resulting in the recognition of $23.3 million expense. Operating cash flow at EQT was $268.9 million in the fourth quarter 2012, compared to $243.7 million for the fourth quarter of '11. Our operational performance continued to be outstanding in the fourth quarter with 44% higher production volumes for the fourth quarter '11 and 12% higher sequentially than the third quarter of '12. We also realized 43% higher gathering volumes than last year and continued low operating -- low per-unit operating cost in both businesses. However, commodity prices were 16% lower than the same period last year, resulting in lower operating income and cash flow despite the operational accomplishments.","In the fourth quarter, EQT recorded $8.2 million of net income or $0.05 per diluted share, again, related to the noncontrolling interest unitholders at EQM. Also in the fourth quarter, EQT announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement for the transfer of our natural gas Distribution business, Equitable Gas Company, to Peoples Natural Gas. We will receive cash proceeds of $720 million subject to certain purchase price adjustments and select midstream assets and commercial arrangements, which are expected to generate at least $40 million in EBITDA. We and Peoples Natural Gas are working very hard to receive the necessary regulatory approvals by year-end 2013. But of course, many factors can influence that timing. So we will keep you apprised as we move through the process. Concurrent with the announcement, we also reduced the EQT dividend to reflect the blend of EQT's 2 remaining core businesses: a dividend-supporting Midstream business and a capital-intensive rapidly growing Production business.","Now moving onto a brief discussion of results by segment, and I will limit my discussion to the full-year results as the explanation for the full year also tend to apply to the fourth quarter. And starting with EQT production operating results. As have been the case for 3 years now, the big story in '12 at EQT production was the growth in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was 33% for the year driven by sales from our Marcellus wells, which contributed 58% of the volumes in 2012, up from 42% in '11. The EQT average wellhead sales price was $4.26 per Mcfe in 2012, or $1.11, lower than last year. The realized price drop resulted from lower NYMEX natural gas prices and lower liquids prices, which were only partially offset by an increase in our hedging gains. For segment reporting purposes, of that $4.26 per Mcfe of revenue realized at EQT Corp., $3.5 per Mcf was allocated to EQT Production and the remaining $1.21 per Mcf to EQT Midstream. The majority of this $1.21 at Midstream is for gathering, which averaged $1.02 per Mcf for the year, and $0.99 for the fourth quarter of 2012, down from an average of $1.11 per Mcf in 2011. The Marcellus gathering rate, as you know, is significantly lower than the rates in our other plays. So as Marcellus volumes grow as a percentage of the total, the average gathering rate tends to go down. This downward path will continue this year, and we expect the rate to trend down to an average of about $0.85 per Mcf in the fourth quarter of 2013. The unit realized price for EQT Production was 25% lower than last year, again, primarily driven by lower NYMEX prices. The impact of higher volumes and lower realized price in '12 resulted in EQT Production revenues of just under $794 million, which was essentially flat with 2011. On the other hand, total operating expenses of production were $202 million higher year-over-year. Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth. DD&A represented about $152 million or 75% of that increase in total operating expenses at production and was driven by the higher volume and higher depletion rates. Consistent with prior quarters this year, production SG&A expenses were up in the year-over-year comparison as a result of higher corporate overhead and commercial services allocations, which were adjusted in 2012 to more closely track activity and the importance of this segment to the company. Absolute LOE was a bit higher year-over-year. However, volume increases have been outpacing the general trend of higher absolute expenses and as you would expect, per unit LOE was lower again in 2012 by about $0.02 per unit or 10% to $0.18 per Mcfe for 2012. As you model full-year 2013, we expect DD&A expense to be $1.54 per Mcfe in 2013.","Moving on to the Midstream business. Excluding gains on asset sales in 2011, operating income here was up 11%, consistent with the 30% growth in gathered volumes that resulted in a 21% increase in gathering net operating revenues. Transition net revenues also increased by almost 16% year-over-year as a result of added Equitrans capacity, mainly from the Sunrise Expansion Project and increased throughput. On the other hand, the line item titled Storage, Marketing and Other Net Operating Income was down about $22 million for the year. This part of the Midstream business as you now realize on seasonal volatility and spreads in the forward curve and those continued to trend down in 2012 versus 2011. For 2013, we expect revenues from Storage, Marketing and Other to be approximately $30 million. Net operating expenses at Midstream were about 11% higher year-over-year, consistent with the growth of the Midstream business. About $10.3 million of the increase is as a result of a favorable property tax reserve adjustment in 2011. So absolute costs were up a bit. However, we continue to experience the benefits of scale as unit gathering and compression expenses at Midstream were lower than in 2011.","Finally, our standard liquidity update. We did close the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver and $182 million of cash on the balance sheet. Based on current commodity prices, we continue to forecast approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow for 2013. We expect to fund our $1.5 billion 2013 CapEx forecast with that cash flow and cash on hand at year end and available liquidity, as well as proceeds from Midstream assets sale drop downs to EQM later in 2013. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave Porges.","David L. Porges","Thank you, Phil. As Phil summarized, operationally, we are coming off another record year with record volumes at Production and at Midstream, and the forecast of another record year in 2013. Of course, our report of 2012 earnings again makes it apparent that there are many transaction gains and transaction-related charges that probably create some challenges for investors seeking to analyze normalized results. In the past 2 calendar years, we sold the processing plant, sold a FERC-regulated pipeline, formed the master limited partnership and executed an initial public offering of its units, issued $750 million of long-term debt and announced the sale of Equitable Gas Company subject to regulatory approval. These transactions have all fit into our overall strategic theme that we needed to make some tough decisions to reallocate capital in order to provide transparency for us, as well as for investors, for the financing of our growth opportunities for this foreseeable future.","To summarize where we stand as a result of all that, we have $182 million in cash on hand at year end as Phil said. We have visibility of a sizable drop into our MLP in the second half of this year, which will provide another cash infusion to EQT. And we expect proceeds from the utility sale within about a year. Of course, the MLP is expected to provide an ongoing source of capital, which would result in the Midstream operations being self-funded. So our core businesses are growing profitably and rapidly. Our MLP is growing profitably and rapidly. We've addressed our funding concerns for the foreseeable future and our operational performance has been on or above plan for at least 12 quarters. We will continue to look at capital allocation decisions aggressively, but now with a more single-minded focus on longer-term improvement of the shareholder value proposition and less influenced by near-term funding needs.","Switching to operational matters, we announced the 12% increase in proved reserves over last year, all coming from the Marcellus, and there were some ins and outs as to what was bought. Some Tier 3 wells previously booked our uneconomical last year's average price, which for NYMEX was under $3 as you know and were therefore moved from PUD to probable, while we added new Tier 1 and Tier 2 wells into proved. We also booked 23% higher EURs on average on 25% of our wells to reflect the 30-foot reduced cluster spacing. We also reduced our spacing between laterals proportions of our Greene County acreage to 500 feet from 1,000 feet. Though all of the things being equal, that down spacing also had the effect of some small decrease in average EUR, which was more than offset by increasing well counts and reserves. On a 3P basis, Marcellus reserves increased by 18%. The other notable change was we booked 2.4 Tcf of 3P reserves for Upper Devonian and a very small amount of 3P for Utica, our first booking of reserves from these plays with all of the Utica bookings pertaining to our small Ohio position. We are drilling wells in both plays this year to better estimate the reserve potential. From a sales volume guidance standpoint, we reiterated our 2013 production sales volume estimate of 335 to 340 Bcfe, 31% higher than in 2012. Liquids volumes in 2013 are projected between 3.9 million and 4 million barrels, significantly higher than our previous guidance. Our original guidance had 2 significant conservatisms or conservative assumptions. First, even though the Mobley plant was being commissioned at the time we were completing our business plan, we did not want to presume a flawless startup process at the plant. We were somewhat conservative about our schedule to fill the plant. As it turns out, MarkWest was able to quickly get the plant running efficiently. Secondly, we have been able to accelerate that schedule for filling the new capacity. Our current forecast is based on our existing firm capacity contracts even though we are working to secure additional interruptible capacity. The forecast assumes no interruptible capacity so there may be some upside if we are successful on that endeavor. For the first quarter 2013, we are forecasting a daily production sales rate that is pretty flat with the rate we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2012, possibly a little bit higher. Of course, maintaining that fourth quarter daily rate would result in first quarter 2013 volumes being well over 35% higher than the first quarter 2012. In fact, as you saw last year, the volume growth at EQT can look pretty consistent when full-year averages are examined. It is quite lumpy when looked out over shorter periods of time due to our use of multi-well pads to develop our acreage in addition to the normal issues regarding the turning in light of new infrastructure projects. As we examine our till dates for multi-well pads and infrastructure projects, sequential growth is expected to tick up into the double digits again in the second quarter of 2013, which would be a result in the growth pattern for 2013 not being as back-end loaded as it was in 2012.","Each quarter, we will give you some feel for the following quarter so you can better model those quarterly results. In anticipation of your questions, I would like to update you on a couple of previously discussed topics.","First, MLP drop downs. We are currently targeting a sizable drop down in the second half of 2013 to fund 2013 Midstream CapEx. We do also continue to evaluate the possibility of a very small drop down in the first half of this year to work through the logistics of a drop. But the entire purpose of such a small transaction would be to serve as a sort of dry run. The size of such a drop if it does occur would be pretty immaterial to EQT's results. Second, the Tioga sale. As we mentioned, we have approximately 8,300 acres in Tioga County, Pennsylvania. We ran a data-room process, and we're not persuaded by the biz that the right answer currently is to sell. Given our strong liquidity position, we have the luxury of not needing to transact in the near future and we will keep the acreage in our portfolio at least for now. As we have stated many times, we are not bothered by the prospect of stopping a sale process if we do not like what we see in the market. Often, a formal process is the only way to test market value. And we believe that we do transact enough to convince prospective buyers so that we do not habitually get cold feet. Finally, we finished drilling our first Utica well in Ohio this month. We are scheduled to move the rig to drill a second Utica well this quarter then plan to move that rig to West Virginia while we permit the other Ohio drilling locations. The first Utica well is scheduled to be frac-ed in mid-February, and we are certainly interested to find out what we have, but we will not have pipes of the well until about mid-year.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We are in strong financial shape and have visibility on sourcing the needed capital. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholder and appreciate your continued support. And with that, I'll turn it -- the call back over to Pat.","Patrick John Kane","Thank you, Dave. This concludes the comment portion of the call. Amy, can you please now open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann at SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, guys, just on M&A when you look at, obviously, you're in pretty strong financial position now. How aggressive beyond kind of what you said and then maybe in conjunction with that, you've obviously established a nice little footprint thus far in the Utica, just wondering I guess that's something you'll continue to pursue.","David L. Porges","Yes, we'll -- look, we'll continue to look at whatever opportunities we think make the most sense for the company. On the -- look, on the acreage side, the real focus is trying to build up more contiguous position to wherever we have acreage, whether it's the Utica or in Greene County, et cetera. On the sales side of that equation, we would still classify the CBM as being noncore for us. We don't really see when we'll develop it. So there's kind of a timing issue there and at some point, we continue to feel that the right answer on the Huron is to get some form of other people's money. So we continue to look at both sides of that M&A equation.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just secondly, lastly, just on you guys continue to just do a fantastic job on cost containment and just wondering for maybe yourself or Steve, just wondering how much costs can continue to come down we look at this year maybe for guidance or how should we think about it for modeling just on kind of typical LOEs? I guess going forward, I mean, there should be more pad drilling or how should we look at it?","David L. Porges","Well, Steve is going to be the one who has to explain whatever comments we make to for the folks in production. So I'll let him answer the question.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well, Neal, I can't give you specifics on LOE targets, but I will say, as always, we continue to focus on finding ways to be more efficient, drill and produce these wells as efficiently as we possibly can. And I think as a result of our strong growth that we expect to continue, you just get some inherent economies of scale. So I just think naturally, you'll -- we should continue to see our unit costs decline. And I think without giving you specifics, I think what you've seen in the past, that's the reason to believe we can continue in the future for quite -- for some time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold at RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe I'll be a little bit more direct to one of the questions that Neal asked. On the Utica, you have 13,000 acres there. Obviously, considering the size of EQT, that's not very material necessarily, but I mean, how competitive is out there and what do you think likelihood is of you adding a significant acreage position and what appears to be the core in that play?","David L. Porges","Well, Neal -- or I mean, Scott. Sorry. I think we agree of 15,000 acres is fairly immaterial to EQT at this point. Our view going in was we really need to have a minimum of 50,000 acres for us to feel like the effort was worthwhile. So I think we continue to look at it. I think step 1 for us is to get the results from these test wells, understand a little better what the economics of the play are in the area that we've targeted. Obviously, it's an area that we're excited about. Competitive results have been good. Geologically, it's at the area that we chose to focus on. So I think conceptually, pending results, we think a minimum of 50,000 acres is what will make sense. However, if we find that we can't get there or disappointed in the results, I think we'd be willing to step back from that as well. So -- but I think clearly, holding a 15,000-acre position for the long term likely doesn't make sense for EQT. So we will either increase or it'll go to 0.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","And in context, Scott, as you probably recall, that's the same logic we had when we got into the Tioga position and we wound up concluding that for a variety of reasons and a lot of them being competitive reasons. It was going to be tough to get that sort of position in Tioga, which is the reason that we started backing away from the idea of it being a potential core area.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, how sensitive to you are on acreage cost? I know a lot of companies will take a look at paying $20,000 an acre, for example, and you do the math on no resources in place and it can look a little bit more immaterial. So I mean how sensitive to you are kind of some of those kind of a high-level acreage numbers?","David L. Porges","Well, I think we're sensitive to economics. So in the specifics of individual plays drive what numbers make sense. So I wouldn't say any particular number we view as high or low. It's got to be within the context of the economics. I will say just to reflect back a few years, I remember when $500 an acre in the Marcellus felt crazy high to us until we understood what the Marcellus was all about and obviously, $500 an acre now would feel like a steal. So we don't set particular per-acre targets. We look at the economics and what kind of returns we think we can generate.","Philip P. Conti","But of course, we haven't done anything close to the numbers that you've talked about, Scott, and those kinds of numbers though would probably make most sense not just for us, but for others, at least in this area, if you're trying to fill in a position. It's hard to place what the value is if you're filling in the proverbial doughnut hole so that you can -- it completely changes your development plan versus when you're getting into a newer area.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right. That's fair enough. I appreciate the color. One quick question for Phil. Did you say cash at the end of the year was $182 million because I think...","Philip P. Conti","Yes.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Wasn't it like $600-and-some-odd million at the end of third quarter? So I'm just trying to square the circle on that one.","Philip P. Conti","To be honest, I don't recall the third quarter number, but it's obviously, it's available in the Q in the third quarter. As I mentioned in my comments, we used $200 million of our liquidity to pay off that maturity of the debt that we didn't end up using the interest rate hedges up on.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, but there's no cash like in investment or anything else that's the cash position is $182 million.","Philip P. Conti","That's our cash position, right? No short-term debt and a $182 million on the...","David L. Porges","But again, the biggest reason for the reduction from September 30 would have been paying off that $200-some-million what had been long-term debt, but of course was listed as a current maturity by the time we paid it off.","Operator","The next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth at BMO Capital Markets.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Wanted to ask about down spacing in Greene County. I believe your prior 1,300 Tier 1 location count was based on 1,000 feet spacing between laterals. If you're able to go down to 500 feet spacing, is it fair to assume that this Tier 1 location count could double at least in Greene County and then can you quantify what the impact to the EUR would be?","David L. Porges","Well, I think it's a little early for us to conclude that 500-foot spacing works everywhere in Greene County. So it was only portions of Greene County where we've done that. We're going to continue to test down spacing. We're testing 750 feet. We're testing 500 and we'll use what's appropriate. But certainly, I think the fact that we've concluded that 500 works in certain areas, it certainly makes us optimistic that we'll find that some form of down spacing works more broadly.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then is there any reason why the Marcellus PDP didn't increase more year-over-year given the 309 Bcfe of additions that you have there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes, there is a reason. This year when we were looking at our booking methodology based on longer laterals, reduced cluster spacing, multi-well pads, we're finding that a higher percentage of our costs are being spent on the completion phase versus the drilling phase. So previously, when we had TD to well, we would book that well as proved developed either nonproducing or PDP if it was frac-ed and in line, but generally, it's proved developed nonproducing. Based on the higher ship to cost later in the process, we thought it was more appropriate this year to start booking wells as proved non -- proved develop nonproducing after they've been frac-ed. So there's a significant amount of less reserves in the proved developed nonproducing category this year, which is really a one-time shift. So you shouldn't see this again next year. But there's about 400 Bcf less PDP reserves this year than there was last year as a result of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ray Deacon at Brean Capital.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Steve, I just want to ask one follow-up on that. Is -- do you provide how many uncompleted wells that were at year-end '12 versus year-end '11? And also how many of the locations you drill in 2013 would you expect to have reduced cluster spacing and in the higher reserve number?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I don't think we provide the first number you asked for, Ray. The second one, if I can find the specific number, it's 88% of our Marcellus wells we expect to use 30-foot cluster spacing. I think that's 132. I might be off 1 or 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Parija at Soc Gen.","Bob Parija - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just as a follow-up, could you provide a split between the PDP and the PUD bookings? You gave an average for the quarter -- sorry, for the year.","David L. Porges","Not sure I follow it.","Bob Parija - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","The split between the PDP reserves and the PUD reserves that's sort of a follow-up to questions previously announced.","David L. Porges","Split the proved reserves into PDP, PUDs.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","PDP versus PUD?","Bob Parija - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","In the Marcellus.","David L. Porges","In the Marcellus. I don't know if I have -- do you have Marcellus specifics?","Randall L. Crawford","Yes, the proved developed Marcellus total was 1.1 T the proved undeveloped was 3.2.","Bob Parija - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","And actually, what was the EUR assumption on each of those?","Randall L. Crawford","They're both in line with the average. That's why we didn't break it up.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Pat Kane. Please go ahead.","Patrick John Kane","Thanks, Chad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Dave Porges, President and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Conti, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Randy Crawford, Senior Vice President and President of Midstream, Distribution and Commercial; and Steve Schlotterbeck, Senior Vice President and President of Exploration and Production. This call will be replayed for a 7-day period, beginning at approximately 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time today. The telephone number for the replay is (412) 317-0088. The confirmation code is 10025424. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website. To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, are consolidated in EQT's results. There's a separate press release issued by EQM this morning, and there's a separate conference call today at 11:30 a.m. today, which creates a hard stop for this call at 11:25. If you're interested in the EQM call, the dial-in number is (412) 317-6789.","I would also like to mention that the year end earnings conference call for both EQT and EQM is scheduled for February 13, 2014. In just a moment, Phil will summarize EQT's operational and financial results for the third quarter, which were released this morning, then Dave will provide an update on strategic and operational matters. Following Dave's remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy and Steve will all be available to answer your questions.","Before that, I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, filed with the SEC, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC as well. Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2013 earnings of $0.58 per diluted share. Operating cash flow was just under $233 million in the quarter, or 36% higher than the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted cash flow per share was $1.92 in the quarter, up 68% versus the third quarter '12.","Our operational performance was again outstanding this quarter, with 42% higher production volume growth, 43% higher gathering volume growth, while net operating expenses increased by only 23%, resulting in continued reduction per unit operating cost.","EQT Midstream Partners' results, as Pat mentioned, are consolidated in EQT's results, and EQT did record $14.4 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest unitholders of EQM in the quarter. Early in the quarter, EQT completed the sale of the Sunrise Pipeline to EQT Midstream Partners for total consideration of $507.5 million, plus approximately 479,000 common units and 268,000 general partnering units in EQT Midstream Partners. While there is no accounting gain from the sale on our income statement due to the consolidated reporting, EQT will recognize a federal income tax gain of approximately $475 million, resulting in cash taxes associated with that transaction of approximately $57 million. That represents a cash tax rate on the dropdown of only 12%, as we are able to use our intangible drilling cost deductions, accelerated tax depreciation and net operating loss carryforwards to reduce cash taxes for the year. These tax synergies are actually a valuable benefit of our current corporate structure as we continue to work through our inventory of dropdowns.","Continuing on income tax topic for just a minute, you may have noticed we recorded a corporate effective book tax rate of 25% for the quarter, which is a little lower than normal. I should first note that the accounting for the MLP structure has the effect of reducing our book federal tax rate as all of the pretax income, including the portion that goes to the noncontrolling interest of EQM, is consolidated at EQT, while we only record income taxes on EQT's share of the pretax income. The 25% effective tax rate in the quarter is also below the expected run rate for the year due to an increase in our ability to utilize some state tax income tax deductions in the quarter compared to previous estimates.","For the full year 2013, we do currently project the EQT effective book tax rate will be around 35%, or right around the level that it was last year.","I will now shift gears briefly to discuss our operating results in a little bit more detail, starting with EQT Production, where sales volumes continue to grow rapidly. The growth rate in the recently completed quarter was 42% higher over the -- 42% over the third quarter of 2012. That growth rate continues to be driven by sales from our Marcellus play, which contributed approximately 75% of the volumes in the quarter. Marcellus volumes alone were 74% higher than they were in the quarter a year ago.","Realized gas prices were a bit higher in the quarter, consistent with higher NYMEX prices. At the corporate level, EQT received an average of $4.20 per Mcf equivalent, compared to $4.04 per unit received last year. However, the realized price at EQT Production was $3.13 per Mcf equivalent compared to $2.85 last year.","A couple of comments on our realized price specifically as it pertains to basis. Basis was a negative $25.1 million in the quarter, or a negative $0.26 per unit, compared to a negative $2 million, or essentially flat basis last year. We were able to mitigate some of the basis impact through fixed price sales, which added $6.4 million, or about $0.07 per Mcf equivalent to our realized price in the current year quarter. The impact of these sales is reported in our hedge gain line item in the price reconciliation table.","As we think about investments and economics, we do focus on our projected realized price, in which basis is only one part, and our projects are still quite profitable at current levels.","Moving onto the Midstream results. In the third quarter, operating income here was up 54%. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased fixed capacity-based transmission charges. Net gathering revenues increased 19% to just under $92 million in the third quarter '13, primarily due to a 43% increase in gathered volumes. The average gathering rate paid by EQT Production will continue to decline as Marcellus production continues to grow as a percentage of our total production mix.","Specifically, the average revenue deduction from EQT Production to EQT Midstream for gathering in the quarter of $0.84 per Mcf equivalent was $0.16 per unit lower than last year.","Transmission revenues for the third quarter 2013 increased by $13.4 million or by 50%, driven by fixed capacity charges associated with Equitrans expansion projects, including Sunrise.","Storage, marketing and other net revenue was up $2.8 million, primarily from unrealized gains on derivatives and inventory in the quarter. As I've -- as we've mentioned several times before, the storage and marketing part of the Midstream business realized on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve and those have continued to deteriorate year-over-year.","Given current market conditions, we continue to estimate that full year 2013 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will total approximately $30 million. Operating expenses at Midstream for the quarter of $61.4 million were about $3.5 million higher than last year, consistent with our growth in the business.","Just a quick note on guidance, we are currently estimating our operating cash flow for 2013 full year to be approximately $1.2 billion. We closed the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion credit facility and had over $400 million of cash on our balance sheet as of 9\/30\/2013. So we do remain in great position from both a liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint for the rest of the year and as we head into 2014.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.","David L. Porges","Thank you, Phil. As Phil summarized, operationally, we are coming off another record quarter, with record volumes at Production and Midstream. We have discussed the lumpiness of volume growth, resulting from the timing of turning these big multi-well pads in line, midstream projects, et cetera. This was again evident in the third quarter. We exceeded our production sales guidance because some anticipated fourth quarter volumes were accelerated into the third quarter due to the turn in line timing of some pads. Much of this increase volume flowed through our gathering and transmission systems, driving the growth in those businesses also.","During the quarter, we also turned in line our first 3 Utica wells. The 30-day rates were published in today's press release. We are encouraged by the results because they were in line with our expectations, and we are confident in our ability to improve well performance and reduce costs as we move up the learning curve.","From an absolute volume perspective, the wells in this part of the play, the volatile oil window, are not eye-popping. However, what we still find attractive about this area are the significant amounts of high-quality oil and very high Btu gas. On a boe basis, these wells averaged 42% oil; 28% NGLs, including ethane; and 30% gas. When processing becomes available around year end, we'll receive premium pricing by stripping and selling the natural gas liquids.","To put the economics in perspective, when using today's prices, the average 30-day initial production from these first 3 Utica wells is the revenue equivalent of natural gas wells with IPs of nearly 9 million cubic feet per day. We are on track to drill 8 wells this year, and we are still at approximately 14,000 net acres in our focused area within the Ohio Utica. We have not added to our position since the last call as we believe the currently high acreage prices warrant patience, certainly compared with the value we see in tack-on acreage additions near our core Marcellus hold-ups. We will keep you informed on our future well performance and our acreage position.","As you also saw, we will be achieving a milestone of sorts in mid-November when the recently announced EQM distribution becomes payable. At that point, the EQM distribution will be $0.43 per unit, which is above the $0.4025 per unit threshold, at which incentive distribution rights for the general partner begin.","To remind you, EQM guided its investors to $0.03 per unit per quarter increases through at least 2014, which would mean reaching the top incentive distributions split for the GP late next year.","Given that there are only 2 months left in the year, we have very little to provide regarding guidance. Fourth quarter production sales volumes are expected to be flat sequentially, in large part due to those pads which were accelerated into the third quarter. This would result in 2013 production sales volumes that are 42% higher than 2012 volumes and fourth quarter volumes at 27% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012.","We are in the process of developing our 2014 capital and operating budget, which will be presented to our board for approval in mid-December, so it's a little bit later board meeting than normal. At that time, we will inform you of our drilling plans, CapEx forecast, production sales guidance, cash flow guidance and midstream EBITDA guidance. This, of course, is our normal timing, given our board's authorities and the governance procedures that we have in place. We have, however, completed our annual strategy review with our board.","None of what we agreed upon should surprise you, but at a high level, you should expect us to: one, continue to accelerate the pace of development of our Marcellus play, which is our highest-returning asset; two, continue co-development of the Upper Devonian play where appropriate; third, continue to focus acreage acquisitions in our core Marcellus development areas; fourth, pursue monetization of non-core or less core assets; fifth, continue to accelerate drops into EQM above the level of EQT Midstream investments; and sixth, increase investment in midstream projects, increasingly directly at the EQM level rather than the EQT level to serve other producers. On that last point, there is a tremendous need for additional gathering and takeaway capacity, and our midstream system is strategically situated to make profitable investments. Also, EQM has the appropriate cost of capital to pursue more of those investments. We have little new to report on the regulatory reviews related to the sale of our gas utility, Equitable Gas Company, except that the Kentucky Public Service Commission concluded that it did not need to approve the transaction. We have previously listed them as an organization that did have to approve it.","As you already know, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act expired, and we are free to proceed from a Federal Trade Commission perspective. We have also submitted filings with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, West Virginia Public Service Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, each of which must approve the transaction as part of the regulatory process. There have not been any unexpected development in this lengthy process, and we still expect to receive all necessary approvals by around year end.","In summary, EQT remains committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and our opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns for our investments and are doing what we can to increase the value of your share. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and we appreciate your continued support.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat Kane.","Patrick John Kane","Thank you, Dave. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Chad, can we please now open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Say, David, maybe for you or Steve. Just a question, you got that big acreage Marcellus play in the Northern West Virginia area, your wet gas area there. I'm wondering in that position what are your thoughts. I know there's been chatter recently after the recent Antero and some other deals about the dry Utica potential in a part of that, and I would say maybe even a large part of that. I'm just wondering, Dave, kind of yours or Steve's thoughts about that, around that area, if that's something you would be looking at or are you going to continue to focus on the wet Marcellus there?","David L. Porges","Well, eventually, we'll look at any area that has the potential for economic resources. I'll let Steve give a more specific response, but I would say, it's not top of our list right now. We've got plenty of things on -- at that top of the list, and that's not really one of them.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes, I really don't have much to add. I agree. It's on our radar, but not at the top of our list. I think it's deeper. It's more expensive. It's dry gas. We're going to be focused on the more profitable Marcellus opportunity in that area for now. And we'll see what develops with the dry gas Utica, certainly there's some potential there, but not a high priority right now for us.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then, guys, in that same area, have you picked up any acreage recently there? I've heard prices certainly recently increasing there pretty substantially. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts on what sort of M&A deals you are going for?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","We really haven't picked up anything of any significant size. We're always continually picking up pieces to fill in drilling units and prices fluctuate, but they're more -- the small pieces we're picking up are more location-specific. So I don't know that we have much of a read on any major changes in acreage pricing in that area.","Philip P. Conti","Neal, a lot of times we get a little bit better deals on acreage in the Marcellus because it is closer, the stuff we focus on, the stuff that's closer to our own development areas and probably has a little bit less value to others.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then, I guess, again, with your midstream, I know there's been, for some other people, some takeaway challenge, infrastructure challenges there. But Steve, it sounds like, I know with your company and all, it sounds like you're well on the way as far as midstream re-infrastructure there, isn't that the case?","David L. Porges","Yes, but Randy is really probably a better one to comment on that.","Randall L. Crawford","Yes, I mean -- Neal, this is Randy. Yes, absolutely. We're in strong shape. We have the Sunrise Pipeline that was completed last year that added incremental capacity in that area as well. And we continue to add additional infrastructure to keep ahead of the pace of Steve's team. So I think we're in solid position.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then very last one, if I could, just very quickly. Just on that Utica acreage, 13,000 or 14,000 acres. Any thoughts on a type curve or how you, Steve, maybe feel like those wells will hold up?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I think, obviously, it's pretty early. Those 3 wells are fairly new. I think the IPs were about where we expected given that it's our first venture into the play. I'll say they're performing much better than our first wells in the Marcellus did from a relative standpoint. And we are sure hopeful that will be able to improve our drilling completion practices, lower cost, increase productivity. So I think we're fairly encouraged. The returns, even at what the first 3 wells are doing, are not bad. So I think we're encouraged, but I think acreage prices in the Utica have been pretty high. It's a pretty competitive area right now. And I think our view is we're going to be patient and only pay what price the resource warrants. And time will tell how much acreage we're able to gather.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wondering after Devon announced its midstream transaction this week, if you would be open to considering a similar transaction if the right opportunity arose, or if you looked really at that transaction at all?","David L. Porges","We've looked at it a little bit, but we actually rely on bankers, probably including colleagues of yours on the other side of the Chinese wall. They give us better feels for what those transactions entail. Because basically, we're open to anything that's going to help create shareholder value.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Is there anything -- any other avenues you've looked at recently to monetize your GP interest or your other wholly-owned midstream assets that you can discuss?","David L. Porges","We're monitoring all of that. We've got a notion of what our inventory, as it were, is for droppable assets. And I think, as we probably mentioned in the past, maybe not in these broad calls, but there's often a number of contracts that have to be put into place. And that we keep working on those, the ones that are at the top of the list is being the first ones to get dropped, and doing other things that are necessary to make some of the assets droppable as it were. As far as the GP, yes, eventually we're going to have to do something with that. But right now, our attitude is let's get the drops going or keep them going at a good pace. And that's what we commented on, exceeding the level that we have talked about initially of what midstream investments EQT makes. And that will be a nice problem to have, when we've created enough value there that we need to figure out ways to monetize. And we fully expect that, that is going to be a fork in the road that we reach.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, makes sense. And then one on the Marcellus. It looks like you guys have completed something like 80 wells year-to-date or connected 80 to shales, and if I'm not mistaken, your plan for the year is to connect or to complete 146. Can you help me with the pace of completions, I guess, in the back half of the year?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes, I think our pace is always lumpy. And if you look back over the previous several quarters, you'll see the number of stages we bring online any quarter. Just so far, this year, it's varied from, I think, a low of right around 300 stages to a high of 1,500 stages. That's heavily driven by the timing of our large multi-well, multi-frac, 30-foot cluster space wells. So it's going to continue to be lumpy. I think the fourth quarter, we plan to bring on more stages than we did in the third, but we'll be far from the number we did in the second. So it will be sort of a modest quarter in terms of TILs with -- I think our projection is first quarter will likely be probably above average, when we look at the likely timing of the frac jobs and the drilling rigs.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So some of the wells you are drilling this year maybe will be competed into next year, maybe a meaningful portion?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Oh, yes, quite a -- yes, a meaningful portion.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","One of my key questions there was just on the timing of completions. And it sounds like fourth quarter '13 maybe a bump to the third quarter, but that will make up the full year. I guess, as I look at the third quarter, you tied on fewer wells than I had expected and yet had a very strong production result, implies good efficiency from the wells. Just kind of wondering if there's any updated commentary around Marcellus type curves in that context and how wells are hanging in relative to the curves you put up earlier this year and how we might think about that heading into 2014?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes, Michael, we updated our curves earlier this year. And I think we tend to like to gather a lot of data before we update those. So no further update at this point other than to say we were pretty comfortable with the new curves when we put them in place and continue to be comfortable with those. So I think the wells are doing what we expected.","Michael Hall","Okay, great. And then, I guess on the NGL guidance front, just a little curious on that. It's a little lighter than I had expected. Is there any continued impact from a midstream side on the NGLs in the outlook for the fourth quarter, or any sort of midstream things we're getting through or is that just...","David L. Porges","The issue in the quarter was there was a MarkWest facility that ran into some operational issues. I don't know if Randy wants to provide some timing updates on that. But that would have -- if you're wondering why it was not as high as you would have thought, it was due to that type of a short -- kind of a short-term issue.","Michael Hall","But that flowed into the fourth quarter then, I guess, that's what I was trying to get at. I thought that was more of a third quarter event than fourth.","Randall L. Crawford","You're right, Michael. That NGL line that David referenced, the MarkWest takeaway out of the Mobley plant has been back in service and so that impact doesn't extend into the fourth quarter.","Michael Hall","Okay. And then last one on my end, I guess, is we've talked about in the past, you got a lot of cash coming in. The recent -- some recent things in the market have suggested use of proceeds around share buybacks. What's your view on share buybacks in terms of using the cash that's coming in? Just curious on your thoughts there.","David L. Porges","It's a good benchmark to be using when we're comparing it to other investment opportunities. And let's face it, the realistic other investment opportunities for us, as I mentioned, when I talk about strategy, are increased development in our core areas, the possibility of those tack-on acreage acquisitions and on the midstream side, those would typically be at the EQM level, projects that would -- that we tend to serve other producers. The kind of projects that are attractive with EQM's cost of capital but that EQT was never particularly interested in pursuing. So those are the things that you look at, and we just think it's a discipline, you should always be comparing those to share repurchases. We're -- and our main point was we're not afraid of what happens if we wind up with a lot of cash because we have dropped quicker than we need money or sold non-core assets before we need cash. If the right thing to do is to drop the assets at a quicker pace into EQM or the right thing to do is to sell some other non-core or less core assets, then that's what we're going to do. And we'll figure out what to do with the cash that results.","Michael Hall","And as you look at that -- and that's helpful. How does share buyback, I guess, stack up in that context at present relative to the other potential uses of the cash? And are you limited somewhat in your ability to accelerate on the upstream side? And does that play into any sort thought process?","David L. Porges","I don't know if I want to say that we're limited in our ability to accelerate, but we do as -- this is kind of the norm in this area, we do run into judgment calls on whether you develop now, let's say, a pad that has fewer wells, shorter laterals or whether you give it a little bit more time to try to get the acreage or the permits to be able to have more wells on a pad longer laterals, et cetera. So you do run into those kinds of timing issues. And we also don't like to be -- have artificial milestones that would inhibit us from making the right economic decision there. But more broadly, we're probably best off letting our whole capital budget process play out with our board before we get into other topics. Obviously, the preference, of course, is if we have attractive investments in our core that can create the value that we've been creating, we certainly recognize that, that is the preferred route to go. We just don't want to force it and get to the point where we're making investments that don't stack up versus share repurchases.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, appreciate it. And I guess -- actually I had one last simple one, the -- in your strategic review, just to be clear, that last bullet point you outlined, drive spending on the midstream side. Is that at the EQM level that, that spending would occur?","David L. Porges","Yes, that is -- that was the point I was trying to make is that you should expect to see more of that spending at the EQM level, and we do recognize that, that means when we start more providing CapEx guidance, we're going to have to be careful to provide guidance on what spending is occurring at the EQT level versus at the EQM level because EQT's consolidated reports will include all of the EQM spending and that gets -- we recognize that could kind of get tough to sort out because the cash flow isn't really coming into or going out of EQT Corp., it's going through EQM.","Operator","The next question is from Ray Deacon with Brean Capital.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Randy, I was wondering if I could ask you a question about pricing at the M2 hub and how you see that changing going forward relative to other places where you're selling gas.","Randall L. Crawford","Sure. I mean, obviously, you saw what Phil reported today in terms of our basis, and I think he also pointed out that we had some forward sales that show up in the hedge line that contribute a positive $0.07. But overall, Ray, I mean, with respect to basis in M2, I mean, I think from a short-term perspective, short-term basis markets, I mean, they're really fundamentally driven. I think that TETCO and the M2 is a strong pipeline with access to good markets, but really any assumption for pricing for the winter, the next summer, is subject to a lot of inputs, as you know, the weather, supply disruptions of growth, really, the absolute NYMEX storage fills. But the impact of the infrastructure projects to transport the gas out that the M2 and TETCO are working on are more certain variables, and I think these projects are going to continue to help mitigate any supply and demand imbalances in the region.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. Got you. And I was wondering, any further update on the Upper Devonian, and I was wondering if you can also talk about how development going forward might look on pads to incorporate Upper Devonian wells?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Ray, this is Steve. No further technical update on the Upper Devonian. But -- and I think we still are looking at what we think the best development scenario for that is, regarding number of wells on a pad and timing of Upper Devonian versus Marcellus. And we haven't really concluded that study yet, we're still gathering data. But I mean, my gut feel is it's likely going to conclude that for -- especially for the bigger pads, pads where we have the potential to drill a total of 20 wells, it's most likely to look like drilling a portion of the Marcellus and a portion of the Upper Devonian and then de-mobbing rig and coming back in a year or 2 and drilling the others. Generally, it will probably be all in one direction, and then the other half in the other direction at another time. But I think our thought is that from a completions standpoint, we're going to be better off frac-ing the Upper Devonian and the Marcellus, the stack side, at the same time, rather than doing all of the Marcellus and coming back and doing Upper Devonian later. And then when we look at the economics of doing, say, 20 wells from 1 pad and the infrastructure and facility investments that would be required to handle those peak rates, I think it's going to be economically more optimum to split it into 2 pieces. So that's where I think we're headed. But we're still studying it to find out for sure. I don't know if that answer helps you or not.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","No, that's very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just sticking with the Upper Devonian. Have you seen any change to the performance of the 2013 vintage wells versus the well that you highlighted last quarter, which I think had EURs of 1.2 Bcf per thousand lateral foot.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Sorry, you're asking if the Upper Devonian wells have impacted the Marcellus wells?","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","No, just the newer wells have seen improvement versus the 1.2 Bcf that you quoted.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I don't -- we don't have enough new data to really draw any conclusions on that. So I would say no at this point.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then in terms of acreage acquisitions, do you have a target in the Marcellus, such as you think you could pick up maybe 10,000 acres over the next year or 20,000 acres?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","No.","David L. Porges","No, it's just whatever is economical. The only thing we're influenced by though really is that sometimes, some things more economical can alter the existing development plans. And that -- a lot of times, that depends on what opportunities are available. That certainly happened with the Chesapeake acquisition earlier this year, and that's -- those are obviously the ideal situation. But no, we have not had a target. We've tried to stay away from that because, again, our fear is that if we have targets on things like that, we'll wind up doing things that are not economical.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And on the 3 Utica wells, what's the average well cost in lateral length there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","The average well cost for those first 3 wells, I believe, was around $8.5 million, but they included a significant amount of science, as we call it, so coring, specialty logging, some fairly long well lines to get to our gathering systems. So we don't think -- the well cost for the first 3 are not representative of what we expect. We expect well cost there to be in the $6.5 million per well range going forward. And the average lateral length, I'm sorry, they range from 4,500 to 6,800. I don't have the average in front of me. 5,800 feet, I think it is.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right. And then last question on the midstream dropdowns. Can you just remind us of the historical guidance there? I think it has been 1 drop a year. And then, in terms of size, it would be midstream CapEx, which is around $350 million. And for accelerating net, are you talking increasing the pace of drops, the size, or both?","David L. Porges","It -- well, first of all, I don't think -- I don't know that we ever guided to the number of drops per year, but the dollar amount numbers that you are quoting, that's correct, is that we were, at the time of the IPO, probably linking it to midstream CapEx at the EQT level. I guess you'd say upon further review, that is -- EQM is the better place to own some of those assets. So the timing on the drops is really set more by when an asset at the EQT level is in the position, both legally and operationally. A lot of times, it might mean you filled a lot of it up contractually as well so that we can drop it, and the capital market's access at the EQM level. But that's really what's setting it. And therefore, I don't really want to give a number on how -- or what the dollar amount would be, but you should expect that until we start running low, that we're going to be averaging well above that level of the EQT Midstream CapEx. And of course, the other moving piece is as EQM continues to grow, it's a little easier for EQM to wear projects at the EQM level, right? I mean, the main reason we haven't been doing very much investment at the EQM level is because that vehicle is very difficult to have a lot of cash in -- or a lot of investments in noncash generating projects. So that wait period from when you start putting the cash in to when you get the cash flow out from fees, that's tough. It's tough to have too much of that. But as EQM grows, it's easier to have more of that and to be able to wear more projects at that level. So that's the other thing that you should be seeing, which we probably didn't -- we talked about the possibility of that happening at the time of the IPO, but we weren't really anticipating any specific projects. And now, we're tending to look more at projects that would be at the EQM level.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And with that, should we think of any amount of CapEx, midstream CapEx, that's now being spent by EQM as being used in the upstream business? Is that a one-for-one type relationship there?","David L. Porges","No. We tend to have more of the -- don't mind [ph], would be too much of a purist, but money is fungible, and you make the right investment decisions based on what you think creates the most value and you don't necessarily say money from this area goes into that area. It's much more of what do we think will create the most value. Practically speaking, we are focusing the EQM investments on projects that tend to support other producers a little bit more. And the EQT Midstream projects are a little bit more the ones that support EQT. But I think at this point, that's just kind of happenstance, it's not necessarily that there's some philosophy. The philosophy is just keep assessing how can we create more shareholder value.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.75 per diluted share compared to $3.43 per diluted share in 2014. The high-level story for the year, as well as for the fourth quarter was very strong volume growth in a lower-commodity-price environment.","Notably, production volumes were 27% higher than last year and Midstream gathering volumes were up by 28%. Due to the lower commodity prices, adjusted EQT earnings adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT for 2015 were all down versus 2014 by any measure, although results in both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing the results year-over-year. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $964.3 million in 2015 compared to $1,424.0 million in 2014. And I refer to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release for more details.","Results in the fourth quarter were similarly down. Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss was $0.06 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted EPS of $0.97 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $233.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $390 million for the fourth quarter of 2014.","Production sales volume was 13% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. We also realized 12% higher gathered volumes than last year and continued low per unit operating costs. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a negative tax adjustment of $79.5 million to reserve certain state income tax net operating loss carry forwards that may not be utilized in a low commodity price environment. This had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate for the year.","Netting out the effects of this NOL carry forward adjustment in the fourth quarter as well as the regulatory asset tax adjustment in the second quarter would have resulted in an effective tax rate for the year of closer to 15%. Although subject to many factors including commodity prices, transactions, et cetera, we think a range of 10% to 15% is a reasonable effective tax rate range for your 2016 modeling purposes.","Now, moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segment, I will limit my discussion to the full year results as the explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter as well. So, starting with EQT Production, EQT Production achieved record production sales volume of 603.1 Bcf equivalent for 2015, again representing a 27% increase over 2014. As has been the case for many years now, the story in 2015 at EQT Production was a growth in sales of produced natural gas, driven by sales from our Marcellus wells. 2015 was our sixth straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth. However, lower average realized prices more than offset the increased sales of produced natural gas in our financial results.","The EQT average realized price was $2.67 per Mcf equivalent for 2015 and that was $1.49 or 36% lower premium than last year. For segment reporting purposes, of that $2.67 realized by EQT Corporation, $1.74 was allocated to EQT Production, with the remaining $0.93 allocated to EQT Midstream. The majority of the $0.93 is for gathering, which averaged $0.74 per Mcf equivalent for the year.","For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $1,251.6 million excluding asset impairment charges and one-time drilling costs, or 19% higher year-over-year. DD&A, SG&A, and LOE were all higher, again, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes were lower for the year as a result of lower prices. Per unit LOE, including production taxes, was 25% lower year-over-year as volume increased more than expenses.","Moving on to the Midstream results, operating income here was up 23% year-over-year, mainly as a result of increased gathering and transmission revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Gathering revenues also increased by almost 27% year-over-year as a result of higher gathered volumes in 2015.","Total operating expenses at Midstream were $318.8 million or $41.2 million higher than 2014, excluding an impairment and the expiration of some right-of-way options. This increase was consistent with the growth of the Midstream business.","And then finally, our standard liquidity update; we closed the year in a great liquidity position, with zero net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.25 billion of cash on the balance sheet and that excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP.","We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So, we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1 billion 2016 CapEx forecast, excluding EQM and EQGP, with that expected operating cash flow, as well as the current cash on hand.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for an update on the Utica program as well as some thoughts on today's reserve release.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Thanks, Phil. As Phil just said, today, I'd like to review two topics, the 2015 reserve report and an update on our Deep Utica program. Starting with the Utica, as you know, we turned in line our first Deep Utica well, the Scotts Run 591360 (sic) [591340] in July of 2015. The well continues to produce at a consistent 30 million cubic feet per day with a steady pressure decline. The well is exceeding our previous forecast and we now expect this well to flow at 30 million cubic feet a day until mid-April before it begins its production decline.","As a result, we have revised the range of our EUR estimate to between 5.1 Bcfe and 5.9 Bcfe per thousand foot of lateral. As a reminder, this well has a completed lateral length of 3,221 feet. And to-date, this well has produced 5.8 Bcf.","Our second well, the Pettit 593066, was completed at the very end of December. This well has a 5,200-foot lateral and was completed with a 29-stage frac job. After initial clean up and a 24-hour flow test at 43 million cubic feet per day, we shut the well in for an extended reservoir pressure test and to install the permanent production facilities.","On January 29, we brought the well online at a choke restricted rate of 20 million cubic feet per day with a flowing casing pressure of 8,700 psi. The initial results from the Pettit well appear to be in line with other Deep Utica wells in the area and are consistent with our expectations of the Utica across our core focus area.","In addition to the two producing wells, we spud another two Utica wells. The BIG 190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia has been drilled to TD and we are now in the process of completing the 35-stage frac job. It has a 6,300-foot lateral and has an expected turn-in-line date in late February or early March. Our fourth well, the Shipman well in Greene County, Pennsylvania is currently being top-set with the planned lateral length of 7,000 feet.","On the cost side for the Utica, we've been able to achieve significant savings on each of our wells and are ahead of our schedule to meet our target of $12.5 million to $14 million per well. Savings have been realized in all phases of the development cycle, with the most significant savings coming from improved drilling efficiency. Adjusting for lateral length, the Pettit well cost $17.3 million and the BIG 190 cost $15.4 million. On a cost-per-foot basis, we've successfully lowered our cost from $9,600 per foot for the Scotts Run well to $2,800 per foot for BIG 190.","As a reminder, we have two objectives for our 2016 Utica program. One, get the cost-per-well down to our target range which we expect to achieve on our currently drilling Shipman well; and two, confirm the productivity of the reservoir within our core Utica focus area of Southwestern PA and Northern West Virginia. If we can accomplish both objectives, we expect the Utica returns in the core area will be competitive with or better than the core Marcellus, and we will work on a plan to include Utica in our future development plans. We will update you on our progress each quarter.","Moving on to the reserves report, as you saw in our press release this morning, we've announced total proved reserves of 10 Tcfe with 6.3 Tcfe of these reserves associated with wells that have already been developed. This proved developed reserves total is 30% higher than year-end 2014 and includes 2.1 Tcfe of increases. Within that 2.1 Tcfe increase is 386 Bcfe in proved developed reserves from wells that were unproved in 2014 but were ultimately drilled and completed in 2015. This is consistent with the company's history of continuing to expand its footprint and develop areas that we believe to be economic even when they do not meet the SEC's definition of proved reserves.","Also contributing to our increased proved developed reserves is over 300 Bcfe from producing wells that are outperforming our previous forecast. Additionally, we converted 1.5 Tcfe or 25% of our 2014 PUD reserves into the proved developed category. We also cut our five-year PUD development plan in half, which is consistent with our reduced activity in 2016. Both of these factors contributed to a 37% decrease in PUD reserves.","Looking at just our Marcellus reserves, the average proved location, considering both developed and undeveloped, is 700 feet longer and has an EUR that is 1.4 Bcfe greater than the average proved Marcellus location booked in 2014. These statistics demonstrate consistently strong well performance as well as EQT's ability to continue leveraging our acreage position within our core development area allowing us to drill longer laterals. In fact, our PUD reserves reflect 337 Bcfe of increases that is directly related to length extensions of previously booked undeveloped locations. These length extensions not only boost the economics and reserves of previously booked locations, but also allowed us to book 703 Bcfe of new PUD locations that were previously too short to be considered economic PUDs.","To further offset the effect of low pricing, EQT continued to improve our efficiency and drive development costs lower. The development cost of wells completed in 2015 was $0.83 per Mcfe versus $1.15 per Mcfe for wells completed in 2014. This 27% reduction was driven by longer laterals, improvements in drilling and completion efficiency and significant reductions in service cost particularly on the frac side.","Our current estimate of total resource potential is 78 Tcfe which now includes 25 Tcfe attributed to the core of our Deep Utica play. Also within that 78 Tcfe of resource potential are our probable and possible reserves. As noted in this morning's release, using the SEC's required trailing 12-month pricing methodology resulted in total probable and possible reserves of 14.6 Tcfe.","If you look at forward-looking prices which are more representative of our development assumptions, our probable and possible reserves would total 35 Tcfe. Neither of those probable and possible totals includes any Deep Utica reserves as we are relegating that play to other resource potential for now, with the exception of the 24 Bcf of proved reserves from our two producing wells.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve. This morning, I would like to review our financial situation and philosophy when establishing our 2016 CapEx budget announced in December as this is our first call since that time.","As Phil mentioned, we ended 2015 with well over $1 billion in cash and with nothing drawn on our $1.5 billion unsecured revolver. In that context and given that we have other potential sources of cash, such as another Midstream drop, we were comfortable with the CapEx estimate that was moderately higher than our operating cash flow estimate for 2016.","However, we do not have any plans to significantly erode that strong liquidity position as we believe that our current conservative financial approach is appropriate for today's environment. The rest of my remarks will elaborate on that view.","First, we've been looking to add to our core acreage position for the past year but have not yet transacted as sellers have not fully accepted the valuation impact of low commodity prices. Ironically, even if sellers' expectations did begin coming more in to line with current market realities, we narrowed our geographic focus to possibilities that have real consolidation benefits within the core of the cores, we have referred to it.","As the market continues to evolve, it seems to us reasonably likely that there will be some actual transactions in the first half of 2016. However, given our tighter focus, as well as some other attributes to the current market, smaller asset transactions seem more likely than larger or whole company deals.","Now speaking of the market, let's shift to our view of the natural gas supply demand market. You may recall that I do consider rig count to be a reasonable, if rough, leading indicator of natural gas production; though some adjustments need to be made to glean any meaning from the published data. For instance, there is a longer lead time between spuds and marketable production than there used to be. Rigs are more efficient than they used to be, especially because of longer laterals and also improved completion techniques and more natural gas production comes from drilling that the data associates with crude oil-focused activity.","As an example of the latter issue, that is associated gas, when using the published Baker Hughes data, we believe it is best to look at gas equivalent rig count; an admittedly simplistic adjustment to try to account for this associated gas involves assuming that each oil rig behaves more as if it is three-quarters oil and one-quarter gas. The gas equivalent rig count equals gas-directed rigs plus 0.25 times oil-directed rigs.","The gas equivalent rig count calculated that way was essentially flat at 700 to 800 rigs from mid-2012 through the end of 2014; so for about two-and-a-half years. The gas equivalent rig count then declined by about 45% by the spring of 2015 at which point it plateau-ed at about 380 rigs until last summer and then again declined gradually by another by another 10% or so. Then starting in late autumn, the gas equivalent rig count declined an additional 25% plus reaching 246 rigs last week. I recognize that only 121 rigs of those are natural gas rigs, is an aside that 121 rigs compares to a high in Pennsylvania alone of about 117 rigs not that many years ago.","So, this 246 rigs is nearly two-thirds below the last rig count of 2014 and 35% lower than it was just in August of last year. This sharp downturn in activity suggests lower future natural gas production. The question in my opinion is when? That is how long is that lag?","At EQT where we drill multi-well pads and long lateral wells, the lags from well spud to turn-in-line, or TIL, is 9 to 12 months. Other drillers may have somewhat shorter or longer lags but they all have material lags. The uses of so DUCs, that is drilled but uncompleted wells, obviously lengthens the time lag between spud and TIL. Also, improved efficiencies can mean that one rig today is equivalent to one plus rigs of a year ago. But this is only true for some efficiencies such as longer laterals. Efficiencies such as reduced cost of spacing, which also tend to accelerate production, can affect the rig volume relationships somewhat over time but mainly improve economics and, therefore, reduce the economic clearing price, at which supply equals demand.","My point isn't to try to predict the exact timing of the production decline but rather, that this decline will occur, and it is best that we position ourselves to quickly respond to a higher gas price when the time is appropriate. We believe that a strong balance sheet does this.","Based on my expectations of declining supply, I am reasonably bullish on natural gas prices once we have worked off the current inventory surplus, as the current activity level is insufficient to meet demand overtime. That said, increased efficiencies and a tighter focus on the core of the core have certainly decreased the clearing price for natural gas perhaps to the mid-$3 per Mcf range, down from our previous expectation of around $4. I do expect that the price will go past that clearing price to the upside eventually as we have seen in the past, as the lags that have delayed the production decline emanating from reduced activity will also delay an increase in supply from a future increase in activity.","Given the industry-leading cost structure of our core Marcellus acreage and potentially the Utica, EQT can make excellent returns at mid-$3 gas. Still, just as we think it is important to be well-positioned when the market overshoots to the downside, we will want to be similarly well-positioned when the market eventually overshoots to the high side, even though that high side overshoot won't involve prices nearly as high as they were even a few short years ago.","In times of financial stress for our industry, we think the prudent approach is to be conservative financially. Whatever happens over the course of the rest of this year and into next year from a commodity price perspective, we believe that having a strong balance sheet and available cash will put EQT in a position of strategic advantage. This is certainly true if my macro thesis is correct.","However, if the alternative thesis, of prices that are much lower for much longer is correct, having a strong balance sheet and available cash flow will also put EQT in a position of strategic advantage. From what we can see, there is no reasonably likely thesis under which our shareholders would be well served by us surrendering those advantages.","So, in summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares and we look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders. And we appreciate your continued support.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat Kane.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Thank you, David. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Will you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] We'll take our first question from Scott Hanold with Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. How are you doing?","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good Scott.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Doing well.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good. So, Steve, if I could ask you on the Deep Utica, obviously, the first well is a little better than you expected, and if you run the math, I think you guys are projecting somewhere around 18 Bcf EUR. And just so I understand this right. And then the total bookings for the two would be 24 Bcf. So does that imply the second well, the expectation's around 6 Bcf. Is that the correct math?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, I think there's two adjustments you need to keep in mind, trying to use the SEC reserves number to back into EUR estimates. One, those are reserves, not EURs. So anything produced prior to December 31 is not in there. That's fairly minor for the Pettit well. But it's also, using the SEC definition, so reasonable certainty, we have two producing wells. The Pettit well had almost no production data, so our reserve projections in that case tend to be pretty much on the conservative side. So I'm not sure the SEC numbers for the Utica wells really reflect very accurately our view.","And we think it's too early to really comment on our view of the EUR for the second well, but I would say that it's consistent with our expectations of the Utica. It's very, very early, but probably not quite as good as the Scotts Run. I think the Scotts Run well will likely stand out for quite a while as an exceptional well and one that is definitely above the mean for the Utica.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, can I ask you this question? What was, from what you've seen in the Scotts Run versus the Pettit, what made the Scotts Run that much better?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","I don't think we know at the current time. We're doing a lot of reservoir testing and studying it pretty closely and I don't think we have any firm conclusions. Again, we have some limited data points. We have two data points now and the second data point has such limited history that I think it's premature to speculate too much about the reservoir just yet, other than to say, I think, one thing we've proven is with the Scotts Run that clearly there's going to be some areas of the Utica that are exceptionally good and with the cost that we've already achieved, the economics of those types of locations will be superior to probably any of the Marcellus opportunities that we have.","But we need to define where the areas are, how big they are, how repeatable they are. And then, you're going to have lots of areas that it's going to depend a lot on completion techniques and the final cost of these wells to see how it compares to the Marcellus. I think that's going to take us some time and quite a few more wells to really define. But there's certainly going to be some areas that are exceptional.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So, would I be correct in saying that \u2013 and I realize, I totally respect the fact that we've got limited data, especially on that second well. But, certainly, you guys are still trying to evaluate whether or not this Deep Utica opportunity can compete with some of your better Marcellus areas. I mean, obviously, Scotts Run gave you indications that there's a good chance for it, but, I guess, the second well, did it sort of put you a little bit on the sidelines yet?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, I think, you can't oversimplify the process that we need to go through. It's a brand new play, very limited data, potentially over a fairly broad area. And I would say our expectations always have been that there will be some areas that are really, really good, and I think the Scotts Run clearly demonstrates that. There's going to be some areas that are \u2013 take more time to figure out exactly how good they are and exactly how they stack up to the Marcellus. And there's clearly going to be areas that you could drill Utica well \u2013 very productive Utica wells, but they don't compete economically. I mean, the Utica is huge, covers a very large area.","So, there's going to be areas of exceptional performance in economics, areas of competitive with the core Marcellus. And remember, that's our hurdle is comparing it to the best of our Marcellus opportunities and there's going to be areas where it falls short. It's going to take some time to define that.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I understand and appreciate that. Thanks.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yes.","Operator","We will take our next question from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you can provide a little bit more color on the well cost targets. It sounds like it's not really changed at this point but you've made some really great progress so far on getting down to 12.5 Bcf to 14 Bcf. Can you tell us where your latest thinking is?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. I think, we haven't changed the targets, but I'm feeling pretty confident that our next well will be within that range. We still have a long way to go on it so anything can happen, but it's looking pretty good. I'm becoming much more optimistic that we will be ultimately at the bottom part of that range rather than the top part. It's just a little early for us to revise that range. We wanted to get in it for a well or two before we start updating it. But I think our confidence in the lower part of the range goes up every day. There's still quite a few areas for improvement and, I guess, that's why I'm so optimistic. We're going to be within that range and can identify numerous opportunities for future improvements. So, we'll keep you up-to-date on how we're doing.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And as far as \u2013 obviously it's still early, but as far as the different parts of the play, do you expect well costs to be materially different between West Virginia and Pennsylvania once you get in to \u2013 let's say once you get closer to those well targets?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","I think \u2013 well, the biggest driver will be depth. Across most of our acreage, the depth doesn't change a lot. So for us, it probably won't vary that much. There are some regulatory differences between Pennsylvania and West Virginia particularly around casing and cementing designs. So, it'll vary a little bit by state, although, again not that much. I think cost variability should be pretty low other than depth and, of course, lateral length and number of stages.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And last one just if you can give us color on where you plan to drill those next few wells. And if you could give a little bit more detail on where that, I guess, the well that's completing right now, where that one is too?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. The Shipman well is also in Greene County. I don't remember the distance from the other two but in the same general vicinity. And the West Virginia wells will be very dependent on the results we see from the BIG 190 well which we \u2013 again we're two-thirds of the way done fracking, so we should have results late February or early March which will influence our thinking about sort of where the program goes after that.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Did you have an AFE for the Shipman well? Or is that too early for that?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, again, I think we're going to \u2013 I think we'll be within the range on our actual cost but we just started drilling the well. So, it's premature. But the high end of that range is where I expect that well to come in.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. Steve, just to clarify your comments, you're saying based on your initial results in the Deep Utica, it's kind of matching your expectations based on the limited data that you have, if you can get well cost into that range that it could compete with your Marcellus program? Obviously, a lot more drilling and completing to do, but just I want to get your initial read on how the program initially competes with the Marcellus.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. I think our thinking all along is if we can get within that range and get the results that we we're hoping to get, there will be areas of the Utica that are competitive with our very best Marcellus. And I think, clearly, the Scotts Run, which I would repeat, we don't expect the Scotts Run result to be the norm. So, that's not when we factor in what we think the Utica is going to do, we're assuming something a little less productive than the Scotts Run. But, yeah, I think, our view is that if we can get within that cost range and have the productivity that we think we can get, that there will be areas that are competitive and probably some areas that will outcompete some of our best Marcellus.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. Got you. And just the overall objective of this year's appraisal program, which could be five to 10 wells?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, yeah. As I said in my comments, we have two objectives. The first one, and going into the year, was our primary focus was to get the get cost down. Since we started at around $30 million a well, we we're certain that the costs in that range were never going to yield an economic project. We've gotten this cost down quite a bit faster than I had expected. So, that was our primary objective. But, I think, we're almost there. I can't quite declare victory yet, but we're getting very, very close.","The second objective was to understand the productivity and the extent within the core of that productivity of the Utica and that's why we have to drill a 5- to 10-well program this year and get various data points, and as we all know, early in new plays, there's always a lot of improvement even on the completion side. You have to get up the learning curve. So, we'll make some mistakes.","We'll have some \u2013 obviously, we'll have some fantastic wells. We'll probably have some underperforming wells as we experiment with different techniques, and we have to gather that data and analyze it, and it's a lengthy process. So, we're going to spend the year gathering data and studying it, and as we become comfortable with the implications, we'll communicate that to you.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And my final question is, just looking at the core Marcellus program, in 2015, you drilled about 160 Marcellus wells with an average lateral length of 5,400 feet. This year obviously, you're doing much longer laterals, plan to do 72 wells. Can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of well productivity for the longer laterals? Are you seeing similar EURs per 1,000 feet of lateral? And just maybe comment on the potential for well productivity gains in 2016 versus 2015.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. Our experience has been that the productivity versus lateral length is perfectly linear, at least out to 10,000 feet. We've seen no drop-off in productivity per foot as we've drilled longer, which is why we been saying for a long time, the longer the better. So, we work really hard on our land department to put together drilling locations with the longest possible laterals.","So, you've seen our laterals get longer especially this year. A lot of that is driven by all the land work that goes on behind the scenes to make that happen. It hasn't been a change in our thinking about the economics of longer laterals. We've always believed longer is better.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I guess I just wanted to talk a little bit about the big picture outlook around production. David, you've walked through your views around the market and the big lags that you can see around laying down rigs and slowing down activity relative to production and highlighted the 9- to 12-month lag that you guys typically see. In that context with the reduced well count in 2016 versus 2015, how are you thinking about growth potential in 2017, fully understanding it's premature to quantify, but just kind of high level? What are the key factors within the 2016 program driving our expectations around a year out from here?","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We certainly think we'll be looking at a lower growth rate in 2017 versus 2016. But also, I think that we will be seeing some growth. And probably that \u2013 I guess you could always say that the productivity of the specific wells that we drill is going to influence what happens in the next year. In this case, you'd probably particularly say it hinges on some of the Utica, even though there's not that many Utica wells. But generally speaking and I think it has to be for any of the companies that you're looking at that when you see lower capital expenditure and these kind of lags that when you look out another 9 to 12 months, you're going to be seeing a reduction in the growth rate.","I think there's going to be folks like us where it's a \u2013 you'll see that real reduction in the growth rate, and I think probably the great untalked about 'elephant in the room' as it were is the companies where they've had a sharp reduction in capital expenditures, and their growth rates going to have parenthesis on it in 2017.","And frankly, I think that will probably have a psychologically beneficial effect on the natural gas price market, but that's still within the context of a clearing price that's a lot lower than what we would have thought maybe a couple of years back. But that won't be the case for EQT, but you will see a \u2013 you'll see a reduction in growth rate; you will for anybody who's cutting their capital expenditure. I'll be happy to have anyone else here add their thoughts to that.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. Maybe the one piece of information I can provide that's related, might be helpful, is if we look at what our maintenance CapEx needs are to maintain a 2 Bcf a day production rate and this is all-in capital including sufficient capital to replace the acreage that we develop with the program. So, certainly, in theory, this would be a sustainable level of drilling. We need about $700 million per year to sustain 2 Bcf a day ad infinitum. So don't know if that gives you any more information?","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's helpful. Do you know roughly of that $700 million \u2013 sorry to get greedy here, but how much of that is that acreage replacement relative to just raw drilling and completion dollars?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, the raw drilling and completion is about $575 million, and then you have acreage, some capitalized overhead, G&G costs, compliance, CapEx, a bunch of other items to make up that difference, so.","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I do want to add one other comment. Observing it, some peers, for their own reasons \u2013 we assume they obviously \u2013 we all try to do what's best for our shareholders, but are talking about no rigs operating in 2016. And I think it's phenomenal what the industry has done with improved rig efficiencies. I'm still a little dubious that you can get down to no rigs and still have your production keep going up.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah. At some point, that seems like it'll give.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","And yet, frankly, the market seems to behave as if, of course, we can get to no rigs, and volumes will keep going up.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I also wanted to think a little more near term. You've got a pretty substantial quarter-on-quarter growth rate implied by the first quarter guidance. Is that more a function of fourth quarter timing of well completions, or i.e., late completions in the fourth quarter or early completions in the first quarter or some other kind of variable?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, it's both of those reasons and really nothing more. It's really timing of when the rigs get done, and the fracs get done, and wells get turned on line versus specific quarter-end dates. So, yeah, we are expecting a pretty substantial growth rate in the first quarter.","We will be, this year, in 2016, the growth will be more concentrated in the first half of the year than in the second half. And you'll see, if you look at our backlog numbers, they came down a little bit in the fourth quarter. We expect you'll see a pretty substantial drop when we report the results for the first quarter in terms of stages complete not online.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. So, the completions pace in 2016 is also then front-loaded, I would assume by that comment? Is that fair?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah, in terms of stages that come on per quarter. Yeah.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","It's more front-end loaded. And it's just the nature of the timing of the rigs and the reduction in our capital program. So, you'll see that reflected more in the second half of the year in terms of number of stages that come online.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Sure. And then last on my end is just the composition of that backlog, do you know the average lateral length on that or maybe the average stage length (41:48)?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","I do not...","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Maybe...","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I don't have that.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","What's your typical stage length?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","In-between 5,000 and 5,500 feet, Michael. Because the last three years, our average length has been in that range.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I know. Okay.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","150 foot frac jobs, five stages.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Bob Bakanauskas with GMP Securities.","Bob Bakanauskas - GMP Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Back to the Scotts Run well, I wanted to ask in terms of the increase in EUR per lateral foot, is that simply a function of the pressures not declining as fast as you originally modeled?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, that's the primary driver, but it's also \u2013 so, we model that. So, it's not just the extra time it's going to take to get to pipeline pressure. It's the history matching of our reservoir models. The pressure decline that we match now indicates a higher potential EUR than the matches we were getting with West data, (43:09) but it manifests itself through a slower pressure decline than we originally had modeled.","Bob Bakanauskas - GMP Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then, just the progress on the cost side on the Shipman well, specifically, it looks like you'll be pretty close to hitting your original target. Is there a different completion design there or are you still using ceramics or have you switched to sand?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","We switched to sand on the Pettit well, so at the current time, our plans are only the Scotts Run will have ceramic. Our reservoir engineering analysis suggests that we're not seeing any impacts from switching to sand. We're going to monitor that. And, if clearly, if it would indicate that ceramic would drive a meaningful change in well performance, we would switch back and at least experiment more with it. But, for now, we're going with sand for this and all future wells.","Bob Bakanauskas - GMP Securities LLC","Got it. That's it for me. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next questions from Dan Guffey with Stifel.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Just piggy backing on that last question. You switched to sand in the Pettit well. I guess, I'm curious on the next two or I guess the five that'll be completed this year. Are same concentration water volumes and\/or stage or cluster spacing changing in any of those next five wells?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, that's hard to answer because we will decide as we gather data and have to commit to certain completion designs. I think for now, generally speaking, it's a very general comment, we're going to try to not change too many variables at once. So, I think the completion designs most likely remain very similar unless the data that comes back is indicating that there's something that we do want to change and gather data on. So, again, I'm expecting not a lot of changes but that said, I would expect that we will be tweaking a few things over the course of the next several wells.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. It's helpful. And then I'm curious \u2013 switching gears to the Marcellus. Can you, guys, give any detail regarding what you think to be optimal spacing throughout your core Marcellus and does this change as you move from Southwest PA dry into the wet West Virginia window?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, actually, we don't see a lot of change driven by dry versus wet. We do see some differences in optimum spacing driven more by clay content in the rock. And our spacing varies from as close as 500 feet in certain areas to as wide as 1,000 feet. I think our average right now is running around 700 feet. So, it varies by geographic location and by geology, but 500 feet or 750 feet are probably the two most common spacings with few areas at 1,000 feet.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one last one. Can you guys give me the annual decline on your PDP at year-end 2015?","Philip P. Conti - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's around 30%.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for all the color, guys.","Operator","We will take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Philip P. Conti - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","With regards to the impact of the CapEx trajectory on production as you see the pace of production start to slow, as a result of lower CapEx, is there any correlating impact on Midstream and the Midstream EBITDA growth? And if not, should we at all see unit cost to the E&P side of the equation move higher, all else equal?","Philip P. Conti - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You mean in terms of a load factor. I guess, Brian...","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Exactly, does your Midstream \u2013 how aligned is the Midstream growth to what you're doing on the volume side to the E&P business, first and foremost?","Philip P. Conti - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I tend to be right around the 100% load factor. So, we're really spot on with the demand and capacity equipment (47:49). In fact, we're slightly over that in this quarter. So, pretty well aligned with the commitments to capacity.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then separately, can you just talk about any consolidation opportunities and your strategy there and what you see out there at these valuations and the level of interest?","Philip P. Conti - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We just keep looking. And I think this is what happens in a down market is the sellers \u2013 the sellers have a more difficult time adapting for lower valuations than the buyers do, right. I mean, I don't think that's unique in oil and gas. I think you probably see that in real estate. You see that in a many number of places. I'm guessing that the Houston real estate market is probably exhibiting some of those same, same characteristics, that's just, I think, what happens \u2013 the comment on the other bigger deals is, as values drop, I think the companies that sell have strategic reasons for wanting to sell.","And at that point, they probably rather sell smaller packages rather than larger packages, because they don't like the value, they're kind of hoping for things to improve. And as we focus more and more on the core of the core, it just isn't the case. As an example, there are no \u2013 I think it's fair to say, there are no publicly-traded companies, where we'd say all of their properties are in what? For us, is the core of the core. It just doesn't exist. And then of course when you look at the financially troubled ones, that's just a whole different kettle of fish. You really can't go in and buy those because the debt is trading at way under par, and it just doesn't work for a company like us to go in and execute that. So, I just think all of those things conspire to restrict the number of opportunities for transactions that makes sense for both buyer and seller.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That makes sense. Does the success you're seeing in the Utica can make you more introspective \u2013 or introspective might not be the right word \u2013 make you more consider just developing what you have or does this increase the case for broader industry consolidation?","Philip P. Conti - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Gee, I don't know. Steve, do you have a -","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","I mean, I would say success in the Utica \u2013 the one obvious advantage right, at face value is it greatly expands our economic inventory which might make you think consolidation becomes less interesting. I think one of the bring drivers in consolidation for us though is the enhancement in efficiencies you get, the synergies from consolidation, that will apply regardless of whether the Utica works. And if the Utica works applies to the Utica. So, longer laterals, more wells per pad, a more efficient Midstream system design. So, all of those incremental value exist regardless of what happens with the Utica. So, I think there's still a compelling case for consolidation given how fragmented the northeast natural gas plays are. There's definitely a lot of value add in having bigger more contiguous acreage positions.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Kane for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick J.

Phil?","Philip P. Conti","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2012 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share, a $0.30 decrease from adjusted EPS in the second quarter 2011. Two price related items together reduced EQT production revenues by $15.3 million or $0.07 per share this quarter, one item was related to gas price put that should have been recognized in 2010 and 2011 resulting in a non-cash revenue reduction of $8.2 million in the second quarter of 2012.","The other was a $7.1 million increase in third-party gathering, processing and transmission revenue deductions, from the sale of unused firm capacity at rates below what we are paying, and I will give you some more on that in a minute. Operating cash flow in the quarter of approximately $160 million decreased by 14% versus cash flow in the second quarter of 2011. Other than that, the operating results this quarter are fairly straightforward.","In short, we had another strong operating quarter at EQT. Production and sales volumes were 28% higher than last year and a 11% higher than in the first quarter this year. NGL volumes were 10% higher than the last year and 8% higher than in the first quarter, and midstream gathering volumes were 24% higher than last year and 9% higher than in the first quarter.","However, commodity prices were significantly lower than last year and that more than overwhelmed our operational progress. I would discuss that in a bit more detail in the segment results starting with EQT Production, where sales volumes continued to grow as planned. As I mentioned, production volumes were 28% higher and that growth was driven by a 74% increase in sales from our Marcellus Shale play.","We do, we did hit two significant Marcellus milestones this quarter. First, we turned our 200 Marcellus horizontal well online and second, our Marcellus production accounted for over half of our total volumes for the first time hitting 54% of the total in the quarter. Offsetting the impact of volume growth, however, the realized price at EQT Production was $2.62 for Mcfe compared to $4.16 last year or about 37% lower. At the corporate level, EQT received $3.83 per Mcfe compared to $5.60 received last year.","NYMEX gas prices basis and liquid revenues were all lower in the quarter somewhat offset by our natural gas hedges, which contributed about $85 million to revenue in the second quarter. The two price related items that I mentioned upfront lowered both the EQT production and EQT corporate price in the second quarter 2012 by a combined 26% per Mcfe.","The revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation to arrive at those realized prices, was $0.56 for the second quarter, and you can see that in the table in this morning's press release. That $0.56 includes $0.12 per Mcfe resulting from the company's inability in the quarter to resell it unused contracted capacity on the recently completed El Paso 300 line at unit rates at or above what we currently pay under the existing agreement with El Paso.","Put another way, by subtracting that $0.12 from the $0.56 reported for the second quarter 2012, a reasonable per unit run rate for the deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation would be approximately $0.44 per Mcfe.","Going forward, the run rate will vary from \u2013 we think $0.40 to $0.045 and the actual reported rate each quarter will be impacted positively or negatively depending on the market rates we receive for the short-term resale of our 300 line capacity that is not currently reserved for EQT production, or that is not currently under long-term resale contracts with third parties.","The value of the unused capacity will vary seasonally, and to illustrate that point in the first quarter of 2012 the revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation was actually offset positively by about $0.12 from the run rate as a result of sales of unused capacity at rates above our cost.","We expect to continue to see this volatility prospectively as we continue to contract for capacity to move production and sales volumes to market, and then sell the unused portion as those volumes ramp up. As such, we will quantify the impact each quarter. So that you can see the underlying trend of the production revenue deductions more clearly.","Produced NGL volumes, mainly from our liquids-rich Huron and West Virginia Marcellus plays were 10% higher than last year and account for 6% of the volumes in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include ethane in this calculation as it is currently mostly sold as an ethane. If we included ethane, the percentage of liquids produced would approximately double.","Total operating expenses at EQT Production were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, LOE and production taxes, per unit LOE excluding production taxes was down 14% to $0.19 per Mcf in the quarter that decrease was a result of producing higher volumes while maintaining our cost structure that is already among the best in the industry. Production taxes were also lower on a unit basis at $0.17 per Mcfe versus $0.20 last year, this time due to lower prices in the second quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2011.","Moving on to midstream results, in the second quarter operating income here was up 14% consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission charges. Gathering net revenues increased by $10.9 million as gathering volumes increased by 24% somewhat offset by the average gathering rate, which declined by 5% due to the increase in Marcellus gathered volumes was due to get charged the lower rate.","As Marcellus production continues to grow as a percent of our total production mix, the average gathering rate paid by EQT production will continue to decline. However, EQT Midstream margins will continue to be strong that the per unit midstream expenses from Marcellus production is also lower than our current average.","Midstream transmission net revenues also increased by 31% in the quarter after adjusting for $8.1 million of Big Sandy revenues recorded last year, and we\u2019re still on Big Sandy.","Storage, marketing and other net operating revenues was up about $2.7 million in the second quarter. As has been mentioned before the storage and marketing part of the midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve and those have continued to deteriorate.","Given current marketing conditions, we now estimate that full year 2012 net revenues and storage marketing and other will total approximately $50 million. Net operating expenses at midstream were up quarter-over-quarter consistent with the growth of the business per unit gathering and transmission expense was flat as we maintained our cost structure.","Finally a little bit of guidance, today we did reiterate our production sales forecast for full year 2012 of between 250 Bcfe and 255 Bcfe or approximately 30% higher than 2011. We expect that third quarter 2012 production sales will obviously be approximately 66 Bcfe.","Based on our forecast we are reiterating our operating cash flow estimate for 2012 of approximately $800 million using the current strip. We are also tweaking our production CapEx forecast to $900 million from $965 million and our total company CapEx forecast to $1.3 billion from $1.365 billion to reflect year-to-date actual investments and our second half investing plans. Our plan is still to drill 132 Marcellus wells in 2012.","We closed the quarter with approximately $515 million in cash on hand and subsequent to quarter end, we did receive $232 million in proceeds from the IPO of EQT Midstream Partners, which Dave will discuss momentarily. We continue to have full availability under our $1.5 billion credit facility, which was recently expanded through November 2016.","With that I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.","David L. Porges","Thank you, Phil. As I\u2019ve previously communicated our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing the amortization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities while living within our means is also unchanged. Of course, the specifics of these monetizations the assets, the timing, the form are very much affected by market conditions. We took another major step forward this month with the successful IPO of EQT Midstream Partners LP.","Including the impact of the underwriters over allotment option, which was fully exercised EQT Midstream sold about 40% of the limited partnership units to the public, with the units pricing on-schedule and at the top of the indicated price range. These units trade on the New York Stock Exchange using the ticker EQM. We believe EQM will provide us with ongoing access to capital at relatively low cost consistent with the steady cash flows generated by those midstream assets.","As we were on our multi-city MLP IPO roadshow, we met with many of our existing EQT shareholders and many of our new EQM unit holders. Both groups of equity owners including those now owning both securities recognized the symbiotic relationship between EQT and EQM.","The capital raised in this offering will be redeployed to accelerate the development of our vast Marcellus acreage position. This acceleration will lead to increased sales of produced volumes, and also increased gathering and transmission volumes and cash flow for EQT Midstream and EQM.","This increase in Midstream cash flow drives MLP unitholder returns and will help increase the amount of capital available through additional midstream sales of assets from EQT to EQM so-called dropdown.","For the time being we anticipate that most large Midstream investments will be made and EQT level. With most of the EQM capital investments coming in the form of purchases from EQT. We do anticipate that there will be some direct construction of facilities at the EQM level, but we do not want too much of EQM\u2019s capital tied up in investments that are not yet generating cash flow. Therefore the basic model is to build most of the facilities at the EQT level until EQM is larger.","Conceptually, our current construct is that over time EQT\u2019s capital expenditures in the midstream will roughly equal proceeds from sales to EQM. As EQM grows more of the capital expenditures related to midstream construction will be made inside EQM. We believe that this approach will allow us to continue to benefit from a key attribute of the MLP structure in that we retain operational control, so that we make sure that we have gathering capacity, where and when we need it to achieve our development targets.","Moving on to other operational matters, as we told you on the last call, MarkWest is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. This plant construction is moving along, and we still anticipate completion by year-end. This is later than originally anticipated, but the schedule has remained the same since our last quarterly update.","Since that last call, EQT and MarkWest have also developed an interim solution, using some existing and some new assets to provide EQT with some cryogenic processing until the originally contracted facilities are turned in line. This capacity roughly equivalent to 40 million cubic feet per day are a third of contractual capacity, came online late last week.","As we also mentioned in the last call, our production sales volume target remain the same even with the current schedule for the full plant that we will obviously not have as higher percentage of natural gas liquids in that full-year total as originally anticipated. Still this interim solution will help us gain back some of the liquids uplift that was considered lost due to the delay.","As you saw in this morning\u2019s press release, we reiterated our production sales volume guidance. New production sales volume is up by 11% over the first quarter and expect to grow at a similar sequential rate in the third and fourth quarters.","I mentioned in the last call that growth rates versus same quarter prior year can vary due to the inherent lumpiness of how we add volumes. As an example, since the beginning of 2010, our sequential growth rates probably a better way to capture this particular issue, averaged about 8%. That is an average quarter had volumes about 8% higher than the immediately preceding quarter. However, these sequential growth rates range from just over 3% to nearly 14%. This lumpiness is largely the result of a combination of pad drilling and the timing of infrastructure [apps].","Knowing all that, we're right on plan year-to-date and confident that we will hit our targets. To give you a specific example to speak to this, we are just now bringing online a 10 well pad in Greene County. On average, the wells on this pad will have initial flow rates of about 10 to 12 billion cubic feet per day each. So we expect that this will be our first 100 million per day pad.","Typically turn the wells on such pads in line one at a time and we will be well into August before all 10 wells on this pad are flowing. You can expect that over the next couple of years, we will continue to have periods during which volumes more or less plateau for a period of time and then surge with the turning in line of a multi-well pad or a new infrastructure project.","Moving on to other matters, earlier this month EQT announced the launch of pilot program to begin converting drilling rigs to LNG, liquefied natural gas, displacing the diesel used to power equipment at the well site. EQT is the first operator in the Marcellus to convert a diesel rig to LNG, which will provide a cleaner burning alternative fuel for the regions drilling operations.","However, we do believe that this is going to quickly become more commonplace throughout the industry, and that will improve the logistics of getting natural gas of the rigs for all of us.","EQTs initial rig conversion is now operating in northern West Virginia and pending evaluation of the pilot program, we hope to convert additional rigs in the West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The LNG being used for EQT's pilot program is produced from Marcellus natural gas reserves and is about 40% less expensive than diesel. The use of LNG also provides another means of adding to the use of natural gas, and we do expect that there will be circumstances in which we will be able to improve the economics further by using field gas.","We are proud to be a leader in reducing the environmental impacts related to drilling. Along with safety, protection of the environment is top of mind for our employees, contractors, and of course, communities. Compared to diesel, natural gas emits between 20% and 30% less carbon dioxide, and has a fraction of the emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxides and particulates.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash flow from operations and from future monetizations.","We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate continued support. Pat?","Patrick Kane","Thanks, Dave. That concludes the prepared portion of the call. Amy, could you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Go ahead please.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning, guys. Just a couple questions, first just is you alluded to on the dropdowns, I guess I was just wondering timing, how soon could we begin to see some of those dropdowns and just again remind me, the rationale of initially why to buy to the EQT and then dropdown versus I thought maybe there would a lower cost structure the other way?","David L. Porges","Well, I\u2019m not that comfortable giving timing guidance on dropdowns at this point, because we just kicked this off. Obviously, routinely we would want to have dropdowns, but I just assume to stay away from\u2026","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Fair enough, maybe\u2026","David L. Porges","Too much guidance on that. Neal, was your other question about why the construct we\u2019re using for the time being at least is to build facilities at EQT and then drop as opposed to building at EQM?","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Correct. I\u2019m certain you looked at sort of cost basis, I just wanted the benefits, how much you anticipate saving that?","David L. Porges","Sure. Certainly, over time we would expect there will be more facilities constructed at EQM. The issue that we have though is that as we understand because we are neophyte in this MLP world. But as we understand it what we\u2019re really trying to do to drive value at that level is, as you try to drive unit distribution growth and it is more difficult to do that when a high percentage of the capital employed is tied up in non-cash generating assets, such as assets under construction.","So, from that perspective \u2013 actually you think even with large MLPs, you see that there\u2019s only a certain percentage of their capital that they have invested in non-cash generating assets, is just the size of EQM, that\u2019s not a very big number right now. Over time you would expect to see that number to grow.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then just two more if I could, Dave for you or Steve; one, as well as looking at the, I think the last presentation, you all had out. I think you\u2019ve identified maybe 30% \u2013 35% of the Marcellus as being wet. Number one is that still accurate. And then number two, around that clearly with these pads, what kind of well cost savings should we continue to assume as this 10 well pad just is amazing. So, I\u2019m just wondering, how much savings we could see because of these?","David L. Porges","At this time, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re bored of hearing my voice. So, I\u2019ll let Steve answer that.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Neal, I think regarding the breakout of wet versus non-wet that still holds. I will be clear on our definition of wet versus non-wet, because into those numbers is an 1100 Btu cutoff. So, I think that\u2019s not always consistent amongst companies. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re using to come up with that number, but nothing has changed in that area. Regarding well cost savings, the average cost numbers that we\u2019re using for our type curves incorporate the fact that some of our wells will be on 10 well pads. So, I think you will be safe to continue to use those type curve numbers.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Okay. And then lastly, maybe Steve just following up as far as uniquely we\u2019re able to cut CapEx a little bit even on the upstream side. Just wondering, when you look at lease expirations, again you generally haven\u2019t had any issues there, will that continue to be the case?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yeah, nearly, all of our acres is HBP. We have a small handful of drilling commitments that we\u2019re easily able to keep up with. So really no issues whatsoever with lease expirations.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Perfect. Thanks with the color.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","You bet.","Operator","","Our next question is from Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird. Go ahead please.","David L. Porges","Hello, as a feeling we might have answer his questions already, or he is rushing out to buy more stock. Amy, are you still there?","Philip P. Conti","Amy?","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from Anne Cameron with BNP Paribas.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Thank you. Yes, I\u2019m here. So just a question on the dropdown schedule, I know you don't want to talk about it too much, which you made a comment before I was just curious about. If you're going to fund CapEx at EQT with proceeds from dropdowns at EQM, I mean, just given the run rate of your spending this year, that implies a somewhat slower dropdown schedule than I was expecting if we slap in an assumption of like 10 or 11 whatever you want multiple on it. Can you just comment on whether or not the dropdown schedule could get ahead of your CapEx?","David L. Porges","Well, certainly, it could, yeah because all of this is over time. I\u2019m trying to talk \u2013 rarely will you find a quarter and maybe even a calendar year in which they just line up perfectly. So, yes, absolutely it is possible for us to run ahead. And I do realize that over a longer period of time, of course, there will be more dropdowns than there will be CapEx, more and more of the business will shift to EQM.","The issue that we get into, the struggle that we have is trying to forecast what dropdowns are, frankly especially given the various disclosure constraints with the new entity. So, yeah, absolutely there can be periods of time even in the near-term when dropdowns run ahead of CapEx.","","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","And is there a target of how much of the EQM units that EQT wants to remain the owner of?","David L. Porges","","No, we do not have a \u2013 we do not have such a target.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","","Okay. And how important are the IDCs from your drilling business in terms of shielding gains on sale from those dropdown?","David L. Porges","","That is definitely something that will be taken into account when there are timing dropdowns.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","","Okay, I guess what I\u2019m asking is, is there a scenario where you could maybe spin-off the LP and the GP and dropdown without those if those IDCs able there to shield it?","David L. Porges","Sure. As you know, we\u2019ve said that we are open to anything that create shareholder value. That is the tax attributes or something that or one of the issues that one ways when looking at those kinds of decisions. So, I don't feel that comfortable saying anything more than yes we would certainly take that into account, but it's not the \u2013 that's not the sole determining factor in anything that we do from a structural perspective.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","","Okay, got it. Thank you, very helpful.","Operator","Our next question is from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Go ahead please.","","Becca Followill \u2013 U.S. Capital Advisors","Good morning guys. Four questions for you on Tennessee capacity, can you give us some more information on how much capacity you released of the total that you have and then how you expect that trajectory to change over time, at what point do you think you will be fully utilizing that capacity and not having to sell at a discount?","David L. Porges","We will turn that one over to Randy.","Randall L. Crawford","Obviously, we have growing production option that we have with our Huron to move into that capacity, as well as some of our Tioga production. So, we do expect to utilize that capacity over time. While the market has been increasing, primarily the demand market around the power generation. It is seasonal it\u2019s not a robust marketing summer. However, it is a constrained pipeline and as demand increases in the Northeast and supply, I think the value of this capacity will increase, but it is seasonal. But our intent is over the next couple of years to utilize that capacity primarily to move our product to market.","Becca Followill \u2013 U.S. Capital Advisors","","So, probably on a 2Q and 3Q level, we\u2019ll usually see some maybe some discounting that not in Q1 and Q4 and then over the next couple of years and that completely goes away. Is that fair?","Randall L. Crawford","That's right, Becca. It is seasonal and I think that\u2019s correct.","","David L. Porges","There is probably just to say, it does \u2013 the difficulty with looking at second and third, even though they\u2019re likely not to be as good as first and fourth with the perspective in the market is. It\u2019s really driven by extreme weather. So, it is certainly possible that extremely hot weather can drive demand just as much as extremely cold weather can drive demand. As we like to say around here, we\u2019re more comfortable when you are not comfortable. The comfortable weather is not for the business.","","Becca Followill \u2013 U.S. Capital Advisors","","Okay, thanks. And then on the MarkWest, the incremental $40 million a day, can you quantify about, how much liquids uplift you think you\u2019ll get from that?","","David L. Porges","Well, we have a slide in our board presentation. I\u2019m sorry with the Investor Relations website that calculates that Becca, it\u2019s in the\u2026","Becca Followill \u2013 U.S. Capital Advisors","Okay, I\u2019ll look at that.","David L. Porges","Okay.","Philip P. Conti","And so just to summarize Becca, we\u2019re currently getting a half down per Mcf on average and that will go up to 1.8 is what we estimate.","","Becca Followill \u2013 U.S. Capital Advisors","","On that incremental volume?","Philip P. Conti","Right.","Becca Followill \u2013 U.S. Capital Advisors","","Okay, thanks. And then you talked last quarter about moving more to the wet gas area with the pullback in liquids prices, is that still the plan, has anything changed?","David L. Porges","Yeah, it affects economics, but it\u2019s still \u2013 you get more, look it\u2019s just one factor. We still get more value per unit volume in the wet areas than in the dry areas. But it can certainly affect individual decisions.","Becca Followill \u2013 U.S. Capital Advisors","","Okay, thanks. And then the last question on the $65 million CapEx cut. I think the wording was that you refined your estimates. Can you give us any more information on what went into that $65 million reduction?","","David L. Porges","Becca, that\u2019s really just having a better idea of exactly, which wells are going to drill, where we\u2019re going to drill them, and when we\u2019re going to drill, and then we did back in November when we put our original plans together. So, there is really nothing more to it than that and just more knowledge about specifically what\u2019s going to happen in the second half of this year.","Becca Followill \u2013 U.S. Capital Advisors","","So, it\u2019s not fewer wells or lower well cost, it\u2019s more of the individuality of the wells?","David L. Porges","Exactly.","Becca Followill \u2013 U.S. Capital Advisors","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","David L. Porges","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird. Go ahead please.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Thanks. Sorry for missing the earlier call. Just quickly, I guess, couple of things on my end. Number one, and apologies if you covered this at all, but the backlog uptick quarter-on-quarter, I understand you are drilling more on pads. I\u2019m thinking that probably is driving part of that. Do you expect that then to kind of maintain at that sort of level or how should we think about that?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","","Michael, this is Steve. I think we expect it to bounce around a good bit, because it is driven almost solely by the timing of these large multi-well pads we\u2019re drilling. I would remind you that, we\u2019re also doing a lot more fracs per well or per foot of well drilled than we used to, which also means there is more frac stages out there per well that can add to the backlog.","But just to follow-up on the pad that Dave talked about, the pad in Greene County, where we have 10 wells. There is 203 total frac stages on that pad, which will be coming on line here over the next couple of weeks. So that backlog of 412, I believe it is a backlog of frac stages, half of those will be going away just in the next couple of weeks from one pad in Greene County.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","So, it just happens to be very lumpy because of the timing of these things.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, that makes sense. I guess the other one on my end is a little more structural. In thinking, obviously now we\u2019ve made our way through the MLP process, kind of begs the question, I suppose regarding the distribution business. How you guys are thinking about that in the grander scheme of things within the EQT corporate structure currently and to what extent is there our inability to I guess put away the production and unit from the others or desire I guess along those lines?","David L. Porges","Well, first of all, I do not intend to make news on that front on this conference call. So, if you interpret any of my remarks is making news then please reconsider, but\u2026","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay.","David L. Porges","Yes, we did say that we are going to \u2013 once we get passed what we did with the Midstream, which is round up being EQM that we would again kind of resume looking at some of the other structural issues. And all I\u2019d say on that front is, we just got finished with the MLP, and we\u2019re really just kind of catching our breadth, and we\u2019ll start looking at all the various possibilities to increase shareholder value. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little too \u2013 we\u2019re just not that bigger company that we could report a lot of our resources management and otherwise into getting that in EQT midstream partners up and running.","And so even though we have the opportunities start looking at other stuff. We\u2019re really only at the very, very beginning of looking at other things. And I would limit that necessarily to just distribution. We\u2019re looking at all aspects of our business to see how we can create more value.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. Is it fair to say that maybe by the end of the year, you will call your breadth enough that maybe you have some more, let\u2019s say concrete thoughts around next steps?","David L. Porges","I promised that by the end of the year, I will be able to answer that question whether we have it. Honestly, my view is we all learn things in new jobs and one other things I learned is not sharing too much about thought process. so I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll \u2013 we try to make progress on creating shareholder value on virtually continuous basis, and I just think it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re in the same month as we closed an EQM going public.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Yeah.","David L. Porges","so I\u2019d rather not put any timing commitments other than just to promise you that everything is always on the table, but that\u2019s not news. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s been, I\u2019d say, since I have been at EQT, our mindset has been everything is always on the table.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it, and certainly understand like you said, just got out of the MLP. Thanks.","David L. Porges","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris McDougall with Westlake Securities. Go ahead, please.","Chris McDougall \u2013 Westlake Securities","Thank you very much for taking the questions, gentlemen. I want a little bit more color on your natural gas drilling coverts, and that of running the rig off of natural gas. Two questions, so what percentage of the overall well cost is attributable to the diesel for the rig, and then what percentage for diesel overall, which I suspect is dominated by the frac stages?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Chris, this is Steve. I don\u2019t have a specific number for you, but diesel cost as a percent of a total well cost is fairly small, certainly in single-digit percentages. So it\u2019s not a huge driver towards the overall cost of a well, but it\u2019s the little thing, it\u2019s doing a lot of little things, adds up over time. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s trivial that we have a cost savings, but up in and of itself, it\u2019s not a marked reduction in well cost. So what was the second part of your question?","Chris McDougall \u2013 Westlake Securities","Yeah. So you had talked about this being a pilot program and I understand infrastructure and everything else has to kind of develop along with it. Do you have any thoughts on the timing for converting more wells or more drilling rigs to this and have you experimented at all with running the frac spreads off of natural gas?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yeah. At the current time, I think as we speak, we have our second rig running on natural gas. So that\u2019s two out of five of the Marcellus rigs. I think we\u2019re going to see how that goes probably through most of the rest of the year. If it continues as well as it have so far, I would expect next year we\u2019ll talk about trying to convert over the entire fleet, assuming that it continues to work well. We have had discussions about the frac fleet. That\u2019s much more difficult problem to solve there. I think ultimately, our desire is to convert our frac fleets over to natural gas. but that is clearly going to take significantly longer than the drilling rig. So something we\u2019re beginning to work on, expect it to take quite a while before you see us actually fracing with natural gas, with natural gas powered pumps.","Chris McDougall \u2013 Westlake Securities","Okay, thanks. And just lastly on the rig cost, how much conversion cost do you have to \u2013 in a capital sense to convert one of these to run often natural gas?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I think it\u2019s in total and for these first ones we've paid for it as a pilot program. We certainly hope in the future we can convince the drilling companies to make the conversions themselves. It varies a lot. I think it\u2019s between $0.5 million and $1 million and the difference is for \u2013 when we want to operate with field gas, meaning taking gas off of one of our pipelines rather than LNG. We have to have a gas-conditioning skid, and the cost of that skid is about $0.5 million. But the cost of the gas is significantly less. So, from an economic standpoint, we think field gas will be the best way to go in the areas where it\u2019s available and we can use it, in the areas where we can\u2019t we\u2019ll go with LNG.","Chris McDougall \u2013 Westlake Securities","Okay, thanks a lot guys.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is from Marcus Talbert with [Sevara Capital]. Go ahead please.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi, gentlemen, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I had a quick question on the Midstream segment, given the way that you framed the capital budget for the company with the reduction on the upstream side. Just curious as to how the projects are coming along the gathering and expansion projects within the Midstream business, and if there\u2019s been any change to the prior guidance in terms of how much you had planned to allocate to this project this year.","Randall L. Crawford","Hi, Marc, Randy Craw. No change in our forecast, and we\u2019re on-time, on-budget. In fact our Sunrise project will be turned in line in the third quarter, August 1, and that that\u2019s $300 million of their capacity on Equitrans, so we\u2019re on-time and no changes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks very much. And just one more quick question for me on the E&P business with this initial 10-well pad that you guys are putting in line in August. Is it that all 10 of these wells will be turned into sales during the month of August? And then just a follow-up in terms of the completion design; was there any differentiation between your standard frac design and some of the newer completions that you spoke about in the past?","Randall L. Crawford","Yes, all these wells should be online by the end of August. Three are currently online, those three are producing about 40 million a day as we speak, and over the next couple of weeks, we should have the rest in line. On the completion designs, there was a mix on this pad, but most of these wells used our reduced cluster spacing design.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks very much guys for the color.","Randall L. Crawford","You bet.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Thank you. You may begin.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Brenda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in the EQT Corporation's conference call. With me today are Dave Porges, Chief Executive Officer; Steve Schlotterbeck, President of EQT and President of Exploration and Production; Robert McNally, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Lisa Hyland, Executive Vice President of Midstream.","This call will be replayed for a seven-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 Eastern Time today. The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415, with the confirmation code of 13637701. The call will also be replayed for seven days on our website.","To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP are consolidated in the EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP.

The dial-in number for that call is 201-689-7817.","In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's year-end 2016 results, and Steve will give a brief operational update. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Rob and Lisa will all be available to answer your questions.","First, I have one administrative note. As a result of the asset dropdowns into EQM, we changed our reporting format for the Midstream business unit. We now report gathering results and transmission results separately, which aligns with EQM's reporting. The Midstream assets that were not dropped into EQM are now rolled into the EQT Production's results. For your use, we have posted on our website, the Q4 and full-year 2016 results using the old format as well as the 2016 quarterly results using the new format.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements.

Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob McNally.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Pat and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2016 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $0.75 adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2015.","Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $816 million in 2016 compared to $825 million in 2015. The high-level story for the year was very strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT's corporate's results.","EQT recorded $322 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interest in 2016 and $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Notably, 2016 production volumes were 26% higher than last year and gathering volumes were up by 21%. Due to the lower commodity prices, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow were both down versus 2015. Although results in both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing the results year-over-year.","Now, looking at the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.25 per diluted share that compares to adjusted loss per share at $0.07 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $327 million in the fourth quarter compared to $239 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Production sales volume was 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, while commodity prices were slightly lower.","During the quarter, we realized better than expected average differential due to a colder December. In the fourth quarter, EQT completed the final drop of Midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The dropping included Allegheny Valley Connector, transmission and storage system along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system, which was sold in a separate transaction for $75 million resulting in total proceeds of $350 million from the transactions.","Now, I'll move on to a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will note my discussion to the full-year results as explanations for the full-year for the most part applies to the fourth quarter as well.","Starting with the production results, EQT Production achieved record production sales volume of 759 Bcfe for 2016, again representing a 26% increase over 2015. As has been the case for many years now, the story in 2016 at EQT Production was strong production growth, driven by production from Marcellus Shale wells.","2016 was our seventh straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth. However, lower average realized prices more than offset the increased production in our financial results. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives was $2.47 per Mcf for 2016, which was $0.62 or 20% lower than last year. For the full-year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $2.1 billion or 6% higher year-over-year.","DD&A, gathering, transmission, processing and SG&A were all higher, again consistent with the significant production growth. Per unit LOE, including production taxes, were 21% lower for the year as volume increased more than expenses.","Now moving on to the Midstream results. EQT Gathering, operating income was $289 million, up 19% year-over-year, mainly as a result of increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $109 million or $17 million higher than 2015.","Looking at EQT Transmission, operating income was $238 million, 12% higher than 2015. Operating revenues were $40 million higher than 2015, primarily due to affiliate contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, primarily on the Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service on October 1, 2016. Operating expenses were $100 million or $10 million higher than in 2015.","And finally, our stated liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position, with zero net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $1.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, excluding EQM.","We currently forecast $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion of 2017 CapEx, which excludes EQM and EQGP, with operating cash flow as well as current cash on hand.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we announced in early December, we are planning to invest $1.5 billion in 2017, including $1.3 billion for well development. Our 2017 sales volume guidance is between 810 Bcfe and 830 Bcfe, with the 2017 growth coming primarily from completing wells which were spud in 2016. Our 2017 activity will result in 15% to 20% growth in 2018 and we expect to grow in the 15% to 20% range for at least the next several years.","Moving on to year-end reserves. Our 2016 year-end total proved reserves increased 35%, to 13.5 Tcfe versus year-end 2015. This increase was driven by our 2016 acquisition activity and our drilling efforts, which continue to expand the boundaries of our core Marcellus and Upper Devonian development areas. Acquisitions added approximately 2.4 Tcfe, 2.1 Tcfe of which is associated with PUD reserves that we will be developing over the next five years.","Drilling activity resulted into 2.4 Tcfe of extensions, discoveries and other additions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we replaced 246% of our 2016 production. With the acquisitions factored in, we replaced 555% of our 2016 production.","Consistent with our consolidation strategy, the average lateral length of our PUDs is more than 600 feet longer than those booked in 2015. It's also worth noting that our 2.4 Tcfe of acquired proved reserves is only associated with reserves directly associated with that new acreage. Over 600 Bcfe of this year's proved reserves resulted from the synergies created from our leasing and acquisition activity. These synergies allowed the lengthening of laterals on our existing acreage and are a key driver of our consolidation strategy that not only adds proved reserves, it also dramatically improves the economics of our existing development opportunities.","We continue to focus on operational efficiencies. And the combination of longer laterals and technical improvements has decreased our per unit development costs year-over-year. Our development costs from Marcellus wells completed in 2016 was $0.72 per Mcfe, 10% lower than the $0.80 per Mcfe for last year's Marcellus wells.","Compared to last year, total probable and possible reserves are 2.1 Tcf lower due to a 7.2 Tcf reduction in the Huron. However, Marcellus and Upper Devonian probable and possible reserves are up 5.3 Tcfe or 83% from 2015.","Regarding our total resource potential figures, it should come as no surprise that our acquisitions helped increase our estimates significantly. But I do want to emphasize that our Utica estimates still only reflect the 30 Tcfe associated with what we believe is in the core. Additionally, the only proved Utica reserves booked this year are from the five producing wells which still have approximately 39 Bcfe of net remaining reserves. We have not yet booked any proved, undeveloped, probable or possible reserves in the Utica.","The questions on investors' minds most recently have been on the status of MVP, the Utica and consolidation. I'll briefly update you on these three topics. There's not much to update on MVP. Last September, we received the FERC Draft Environmental Impact Statement and the comment period on the draft EIS ended in late December. We are currently preparing responses to a FERC Environmental Information Request, which is typical for the process as the Commission works to develop the final EIS. We continue to target a late 2018 in-service date.","On the Utica, since last quarter we have not turned any new wells online. We are currently fracking the BIG177 in West Virginia and we're also currently drilling another well in Greene County, Pennsylvania. We plan on spudding seven Utica test wells during 2017.","On consolidation, as I mentioned last quarter, we added 230,000 net core Marcellus acres from 2013 to 2016. We believe the biggest benefit from continued consolidation is the economic benefits of longer laterals. We'll continue to look to add acreage at bolt-on or fills in our existing core acreage position. This week, we purchased an additional 14,000 core West Virginia acres, primarily in Marion and Monongalia Counties, West Virginia for $130 million.","Consistent with our objective of extending laterals, this acquisition will allow us to extend 64 well locations from an average of 1,900 feet to 5,700 feet. The latest deal is consistent with our previous comments on consolidation. One, we are focusing our core, motivated by longer laterals; and two, small deals are more likely the large acreage deals or corporate transactions.","Our focus continues to be increasing shareholder value by focusing on full cycle returns. We will accomplish this by driving development and operating costs lower, expanding optionality in our sales portfolio to improve our realized prices and maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather the inevitable commodity price cycles.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Pat Kane.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thank you, Steve. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Brenda, can we please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Steve, congratulations on the new role and Dave, you obviously will be missed. And then maybe if we can just start by, Steve, if you had anymore thoughts on \u2013 the focus of your role as you take over the helm and you guys talked more about shifting to more operations related strategy than financially related strategy, do you have any thoughts there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, thanks, Drew. I think just \u2013 maybe a \u2013 just a couple of general comments in that area. I've been here for 17 years now. So, I've been working either for or with Dave for that entire time. So, I've been involved and certainly onboard with the strategy and the direction of the company. So, I think you shouldn't expect to see dramatic strategic changes in what we're trying to accomplish.","More likely, you'll see changes in how we \u2013 or how differences and how we function between Dave and I. So we have different personalities and different approaches to things, but I think the general strategy will remain consistent and that is to focus clearly on increasing shareholder value, ultimately a lot of that comes from driving costs lower. And I think you've heard us talk about it, but two big themes here are consolidation and innovation.","So, we've talked a lot about longer laterals and economic benefits we get from that. And over the past eight years or so with the Marcellus, you've seen the progress us and the industry has made on improving returns through innovation and new technologies and we will continue to try and be a leader in that area.","So, I think there has always been a strong operational focus as well as a strong financial focus. You will see that continue, although I think, there probably a little less financial engineering that will be needed in the future than we've seen over the past seven years or so.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that, Steve. So, I guess, if you're talking about focusing on, partly on costs and lateral lengths, how much of extending laterals do you think you can do from really blocking up and acreage swaps versus needing to really consolidate land position through acquisitions?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, I think it's going to require both. But I think to get meaningful improvement, it's clearly going to require some additional acquisition opportunities. We've seen significant benefits from the ones we've done, and that's a kind of thing that builds on itself. So the more you do, the more benefit you get even from the previous acquisitions. And that said, the bigger position we build in the core area certainly facilitate additional trades with our partners who are also trying to consolidate their positions because they see the value as well.","So, you're going to see both. And I think, we'd like to continue to do some acquisition activity, as I mentioned. We think the smaller deals like we've done are much more likely than any sort of large strategic merging of big players.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Last one from me, Steve. You guys will have a bigger program in the Upper Devonian this year than I guess last year, in particular, do you feel like you'll likely learn a lot more about how to develop those two concurrently or do you feel like you already know only about the reservoir and incremental earnings will be small?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","I think we have a pretty good understanding. I think we have more producing Upper Devonian wells than anyone else. And we feel strongly in the data that's coming in is confirming our belief that within that, that certain area that we show in our Investor Presentation, within that area, it is a user-delusive proposition, and incrementally the NPV per acre is significantly higher if we take the Upper Devonian now in conjunction with the Marcellus than if we don't, and then lose the opportunity forever.","So, we feel even more certain about that conclusion today than we did even six months ago. But I think because of the number of wells we are producing, I think, we have a high-level of certainty about the results and what the right approach is in that area.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that Steve. And congrats again to both of you.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Drew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good morning.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Good morning.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, Steve, I like that \u2013 I like the consolidation and innovation theme, it's pretty catching, and pretty applicable to you all. Can you talk a little bit more on the innovations side of things, where can you go from here, I mean, obviously longer laterals, are sort of the \u2013 I guess, I'll say the layup, but when you look at just in sort of the proppant loading, stage facing, where you think you could go from where we're at today?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, I think on the completion side, as we mentioned before, we've started doing bigger frac jobs and higher proppant loadings. We're not quite ready to announce any revisions to our type curves, but I would expect it will, we'll have an update by the next call. We just want to get a little more data there, and we're expanding that to \u2013 we're now testing even higher proppant loads that will take some more time to conclude how much or if, there is a benefit there, but we continue to experiment and look for better ways on the completion side.","I would say our innovations aren't solely focused on drilling completion activities though, and a couple areas we're doing a lot of work in are kind of more on the logistical side. So, we're doing a lot of operations research kind of work on our rig scheduling and our frac scheduling and how we move and transport water. And what we're finding through some pretty advanced modeling is our previous assumptions about what was optimum turn out to be pretty far off.","And the conclusions from these models really aren't intuitive. Very difficult for a human being to look at a spreadsheet and come up with the optimum schedule. So we're just starting that kind of work. We think the applicability to our business could be pretty widespread and potentially pretty dramatic in terms of lowering our unit operating costs. So a lot of work happening in that area. It'll take some time, but we're pretty excited about it.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can you give us an example of what you mean by that, just some of the logistical things? Maybe just one salient example just to give us some construct of what you all are doing and seeing?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Sure. So one example we did is we brought in a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University to help us with this modeling because it's pretty advanced stuff for certainly for someone like me. And first thing he did was he did a look-back on a group of pads in Greene County that we had already drilled. So we knew what we had thought was optimum.","And our typical assumption was generally if we have multi-well pads, drill all the wells with the rig. It's very expensive to move rigs. It's about $0.5 million every time we move a rig. So we thought it was best to drill all the wells, move the rig somewhere else, bring in the frac crews, bring in the water and the sand, and frac all the wells back-to-back and then bring them all online.","And he looked back and built this model which incorporated the logistics of the water, logistics of the crews, the downtime associated with the production, the pipeline capacities and capacity availability, a number of other variables. And the rig schedule that it printed out looked like a pig's breakfast. I mean, it was moving rigs a lot more often than we thought. But said that we would have created significantly more value had we followed that schedule. So that really opened our eyes. And we really thought, well, this might really add some value if we get these kind of results everywhere else.","So we're starting to apply that, again, to rig and frac scheduling, but also to helping us decide how to better design our pipeline systems to make that capital more efficient and, importantly, the best ways to move our water, because that's becoming a bigger and bigger piece of our cost structure.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No, that was really helpful. Thanks. And then for a follow-up question, on the consolidation side of things, and it sounds like you did an acquisition here recently. And I'm sorry if I missed it, did you say what the production volume you added from there was? If you have that, that'd be great. But just big picture, how many of these outside of just regular trading \u2013 how many of these little bolt-on opportunities are still hanging out there in your core area?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, on your first question, it didn't add any current production. This was strictly undeveloped acreage. And I will mention on it just because it makes this one of bit unique, is all of that acreage is either fee, about half of it is in fee, so 100% net revenue interest, and the other half is held by production by shallow wells. So we'll control that acreage forever and have a very high net revenue interest.","Regarding how many others are out there, it's always hard to say because there's been, for the past year or so, a fairly steady flow of opportunities. And we've been involved in all or most of those. And I think we're still optimistic that that flow is going to continue. But it's hard to predict. At any given time, there is two or three that are, I'd say, active. But sometimes active means there is a data room and the seller is clearly motivated to sell. And other times active means we're in discussions with a party and it seems like there might be a deal to be done. But sometimes it doesn't work out. So I would say for the scale of acquisitions we've been doing, we expect the flow to continue for at least a while.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your questions.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Morning, gentlemen. Just a couple quick ones. First, maybe on the guidance. Just curious on the expectation for better differentials, what you're seeing there. Is that just two months now of better bid week (26:45) pricing, or if you've got some sort of fundamental change that you're seeing could flow through for the rest of 2017?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Holly. This is Rob. Really that just reflects what the market pricing is. We're just taking the forward curve at the different places where we sell our gas. So we're not taking a view that's different in the market's. It's just that the forward curve has improved on basis.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Great. And then maybe, Steve, I know you mentioned MVP, maybe just some thoughts there. It looks like we should receive a Final EIS maybe in mid-March. So, just given kind of what's going on with the Commission right now, just any sort of thoughts there on how this thing could play out for MVP?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I think, Holly \u2013 well, first of all, the Final EIS is not dependent on having a quorum on the Commission. So, the staff can take care of that. So, we think, as far as the current situation with the commissioners shouldn't have any impact on our receipt of the Final Environmental Impact Statement.","We are responding to a long list of questions, which seems to be the norm in today's environment and we continue to hope to get it on time. I think, we understand it, there is a possibility that the FEIS could be delayed. I would say, we still have some slack in the schedule and the real target date for us is to receive the notice to proceed in November.","So, I think, we're still optimistic that we're on schedule and we'll be able to get this thing in line by the end of 2018. Probably the last thing, I would say is, a lot of the work we're doing and responding to the questions. We think we'll go a long way toward answering a lot of the questions and help with a lot of the work that the other agencies have to do, once we receive the FEIS. So, even if we get delayed on the FEIS, it doesn't necessarily mean that the entire process is delayed.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","No, that's great. Thank you for that. And then maybe one final one from me. On the seven Utica test for 2017, can you give us the PA, West Virginia split?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, I would say, right now, we don't know. We're going to keep that open depending on results. Right now, from what we're seeing, I would imagine, the majority will be in Pennsylvania; but as I said, we're currently fracking a well in West Virginia and if that result is encouraging, we might shift a few of them to West Virginia. So, we're going to be driven by the results we see.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Great. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Holly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","On the topic of longer laterals without additional acquisitions, where could you get to on a company average basis, a couple years out versus where you are today? And if we think about the acquisition opportunity, is there some way of summarizing, or you could say, for X billion dollars of acquisitions you could take that company average lateral length out to some, fill in the blank greater number?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, those are pretty impossible questions to answer. What I can tell you is, when we're looking out 2018, we expect the average to be 8,000 feet or above. So, we continue to increase that average length pretty significantly year-over-year. It's hard to predict with additional acquisitions, what the impacts will be, because they're very dependent on where they're at. Also, dependent on other activity, leasing activity where that is, how contiguous those pieces are? So, it's very tough to answer that.","I will say, in theory, we think 15,000 foot laterals are optimum, I don't expect that we will get there, so to be clear on that. But any additional length up to something close to that adds real value to our investment. So, we're going to continue to do everything we can to get them as long as we can.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Brian, just one \u2013 just one additional comment to that is, I would say that we clearly will have a view, if we're doing an acquisition that it is helping us with lateral lengths, if it's not \u2013 it's not an acquisition that we would likely do, it's hard to quantify how much that would be, but there will \u2013 we will clearly have a view that it's improving lateral lengths.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And then, having just gone through the reserve report and having acquired some additional acreage, can you just give us an update on the natural gas price points both locally in the local market and Henry Hub where you would both either pull back on activity or accelerate activity?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, I think we run most of our economics at the local price. So, if it doesn't make sense at that we're not going to be investing. And I think we've laid out on our Investor Presentation, what our market mix is, and so that should give you a pretty clear idea of \u2013 and it's all pretty fungible because of the Equitrans header system, all that's connected. So we can move gas to all those markets pretty easily. And the next big shift you will see beyond the recent OVC and (32:33), the next big one will be when MVP comes operational, and we're selling a lot of gas to the Southeast market.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. I just had a one clarification on lateral lengths, because Steve you talked about wanting to extend laterals, but if we look at the 2017 program, the lateral lengths of the Marcellus are down a little bit, and also for the Upper Devonian. Could you just comment on why you're drilling shorter laterals this year versus last?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, I think when it's all said and done, that's probably not likely to be the case, but we did have a large, very long lateral pad right at the end of 2016 that bumped those averages up. Originally, that pad was probably going to be at 2017 pad, but I think that's really an indication of the results we're seeing from the acquisitions, and we're still getting our arms around some of the specifics of the more recent acquisitions, and what they're going to add. So for now, we haven't really built that in. So, I think that's \u2013 some of that's just preliminary numbers.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. I just wanted to make sure, but it sounds like the trend is to go to eight in 2018?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. We'll certainly be above eight in 2018. Yes.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Great. My follow-up question for you is really to talk a little bit about the 2017 program. I understand that the CapEx program does include cost for your enhanced completion program, but I believe that you guys haven't yet adjusted your type curves to include the uplift from that, so I was just wondering Steve, if you could maybe comment on what you're seeing in terms of potential well productivity gains from using more proppant in stages, clusters et cetera. And perhaps frame some potential upside to production for this year?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I think I'm going to pass on that for now. I think we want to gather a little bit more data before we start quoting our uplift estimates. I will say, from the results we're seeing, they seem pretty consistent with what our modeling suggested we'd see. So, we're optimistic that it's working, but we don't quite have enough data to want to commit to any number. So, I'd ask you to hold off until the next call where we would expect to be able to quote something that we can stand behind.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just last question regarding MVP. It sounds like you guys are still confident in the timing, but if there are some timing slippage, how could that affect the company and what are some thoughts around managing around that timing risk?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","I think the nature of the construction process is the, the critical path on the MVP project is around the compressor station construction, about a 14-months timeframe to do that. So, because of the nature of that, a one-month delay in getting approval is probably a one-month delay in turn in line.","The next item on the critical path is the actual construction of the line, which is dependent on our ability to be able to clear trees. And there are limits around because of the bat populations when we're able to do that. So generally speaking, and there are lots of variables to this; none of this is for certain. But delaying the notice to proceed at least on that part of it, because it's possible to get a partial notice to proceed on the compressor stations, but if the pipeline construction is delayed into February, it might get difficult to get the trees cleared in the tree clearing window to hold to that end of 2018 timeframe.","So those are kind of some of the key dates we're focused on. But that said, there are possible mitigants to that in terms of, again, partial notices to proceed or possibilities of being able to extend the tree cutting window. So lots of variables, but those are some key dates we're shooting for.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next questions comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead with your questions.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate you having me on the call. I guess I was curious on the West Virginia activity in 2017. I guess 47 wells will be drilling. How much of that would you say is on let's say the Eastern side of the core development area highlighted in the slide decks? And what sort of timeline do you think in terms of providing some incremental well results on that, let's say, more extensional side of the core?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","I think \u2013 so East versus West. In West Virginia, it coincides pretty well with the wet versus dry. So it's about two-thirds on the wet, so that would be the Western side, one-third on the Eastern side.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","And I think probably on the next call we can provide some updated information on the results on the Eastern side. I think we have some recent wells over there that we're real happy with the results. So I think our confidence is even higher, particularly like this acquired acreage in Marion and Mon that's right nearby a pad we brought online last fall that's outperforming our expectation. So we'll try to target for the next call or next press release to give you some more insight on that.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Great. That'd be helpful. And it seems like with some of the deals late last year and then now these most recent acreage adds, those seem to be kind of bulking up in that side of the window. Is that a fair statement? And is that kind of a focus area for further acreage consolidation going forward? And how would you characterize that?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","I would say we don't have particular focus areas. We look at the opportunities that come up and see how well they fit. And some of those are on the Eastern side in the dryer area fit very, very well. So we get a lot of the synergy value, which is what we're looking for.","But as always, they have to make sense. So we're not going to go by acreage in areas where we're not confident we can earn good returns on our drilling investments. Again, we've been pretty encouraged with the results we're seeing in those areas, so I think we feel really good about them. And they've been a particularly nice fit with our existing position.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Great. That make sense. Yeah. It seemed like perhaps with your actions speaking to a view that you thought you had a slightly differentiated view on that, that part of the play. So we'll keep our eyes out.","I guess I wanted to follow-up also on I think it was Scott's question around the logistical side of things. Just curious, that logistical optimization you talked about. Might that have impacts around the kind of historical cycle time you guys talked about (40:34) about nine months in the past? Do you think you could potentially shrink that. And what, if any, potential impacts could that have on 2017, or would that be more of a potential impact to 2018 numbers?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","We certainly think it could have an impact on that. And if it does, the impact is almost certainly to shorten those cycle times.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Sure. Any quantification...","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","We already \u2013 we haven't done enough of the work yet to really build in any benefit in 2017. Not to say we won't see any. We might. But I would think we'll have enough of the modeling done and tested it enough hopefully by 2018 to incorporate it into our planning.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next questions comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead with your questions.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Steve, the first question I had was more on the new acreage everybody has been talking about around West Virginia. Is there a room of just looking at that Equitrans expansion project, is there room on that for incremental production there? Or what are you thinking about takeaway in that area?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Do you want to take that, Lisa?","M. Elise Hyland - EQT Corp.","Hi. This is Lisa Hyland. We are certainly in the process of working through the Equitrans expansion project. And we do have expansion capabilities that would line up with MVP expansion capabilities as well.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Great. And let me ask just a second one, Steve, for you on this \u2013 the new acreage, you mentioned in the press release talking about the 42,600 in the Marcellus in West Virginia. Now there are 17,000 in the Marcellus in southwestern Pennsylvania, and that mentions about 39,300 of that has Utica on both, does that mean you all have \u2013 have just you bought the deep rights just on 39,000 or you currently are just assuming the 39,300 has the potential, maybe I just want to make sure I'm think about that correct?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","That was just the rights that we acquired. So, it's not a comment on the prospectivity of any of that, that's the Utica rights that came with that package.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. So that's 60,000, about two-thirds of that, then you acquired the Utica rights with? Is that correct, Steve?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yes, yes, that's correct.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then just last one I had was, we have certainly seen a nice uptick in NGL prices. Does that \u2013 I know people have \u2013 and you've kind of talked about Steve on the call so far, where you are thinking about drilling with all the rigs you are certainly going to be active? Does the improvement of NGL prices change how you think about target areas? I mean, when I look particularly in the Marcellus, you've got that rectangle always laid out where you're looking at new and existing acreage. Does the improvement of NGL prices change or you might target some of the drilling for the latter part of this year?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Neal, I don't think the changes in NGL prices so far have been dramatic enough to have us rethink where we think we're going to be drilling. And there is always a number of factors that go into how we develop our plan.","Certainly prices are a big factor, but available capacity where the gathering systems or \u2013 have capacity to get gas to market, where we have processing capacity. And at least personally I'm always reluctant to make short-term changes in our plans, based on short-term changes in commodity prices, especially given the nine month to 12 month delay from when we change our plans to when we're getting the production online. It just seems like every time we try and do that, we're never in sync with the market, we're always chasing the market and it's changed by the time we benefit from it. So, the moves would have to be dramatic and we'd have to have a view that they are going to be sustained before we would really rework calendar year development plan.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That sort of makes sense. And maybe if Lisa could maybe just comment on one other takeaway question about all the Utica drilling potentially doing either in PA or West Virginia. Just sort of how you all look for takeaway this year with Utica, takeaway in those areas?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","I think for the areas we were likely to test, we have plenty of takeaway for seven wells. So, I think the takeaway question really isn't going to factor into where we're drilling, these tests are still mostly designed to understand the reservoir. Again I think on the cost side, we're real happy with where we're at. But we want to understand what the production mechanisms are, what the recoveries are going to be and what's the extent of the economic area of the Utica. So that's what's going to drive our location decisions in 2017.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the details, Steve and Lisa.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Patrick J.

The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415. The confirmation code is 13637693. The call will also be replayed for seven days on our website.","To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnership will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 a.m. today, which requires that we take the last question of this call at 11:20 a.m. The dial-in number for that call is 201-689-7817.","In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's second quarter 2016 results. Dave will discuss our increase in activity. And finally, Steve will give a brief Utica update. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Randy, and Rob will all be available to answer your questions.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain certain forward-looking statements.

Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob McNally.","Robert J. McNally - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Pat. Before reviewing second quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisition from Statoil, which closed on July 8. In connection with the acquisition, on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. A portion of the proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of 62,500 net Marcellus acres and 53,000 net Utica acres, primarily in Wetzel, Tyler, and Harrison Counties of West Virginia, for $407 million.","The acquired acres include current natural gas production of approximately 50 million per day which will add about 7 Bcf to our sales volume during the second half of the year. The acquisition also includes approximately 500 undeveloped locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing development area.","I will now provide a brief overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2016 adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.35, down from an adjusted loss of $0.06 in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by $32.7 million to $113.8 million for the quarter.","During the quarter, we terminated the remaining vestiges of our defined benefit pension plan. As a result, we've recognized a loss of $9.4 million to earnings, $7.7 million of which are attributable to Midstream. In connection with the purchase of annuities, we made a cash payment of $5.4 million to fully fund the plan. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results.","EQT recorded $77.8 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the second quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the third quarter of 2016 and $320 million for the full year, assuming the midpoints of EQM's guidance.","The high-level story for the second quarter was strong volume growth in a lower commodity price environment. We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record gathering volumes at Midstream.","The second quarter was very straightforward, so I'll keep my remarks brief. EQT Production continued to grow sales and produce natural gas. Production sales volume of 184.5 Bcf in the recently completed quarter was 26% higher than the second quarter of 2015.","As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.11 per M compared to $2.75 per M in the second quarter of last year. You will find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's release.","Net marketing revenues totaled $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, $7.7 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity costs in 2016. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $516 million or $60.3 million higher quarter-over-quarter, including a $7.1 million legal reserve. DD&A, gathering, transmission, and processing expenses and production taxes were all higher consistent with the significant production growth, although exploration expenses were lower for the quarter.","Moving on to the Midstream business, operating income was $124.5 million, up 15% over the second quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $21.9 million than the second quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $89.8 million, $5.5 million higher over the same period last year, including the pension charge. On a per-unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 23% as a result of volumes growing faster than expenses.","And then, finally, our standard liquidity update, we closed the quarter in a great liquidity position, with zero short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $2.2 billion of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions from EQGP.","With that, I will turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rob. My comments today are focused on updates to thoughts we shared during April's call regarding the macro environment, first, regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production. At that time, there were 174 gas-equivalent rigs down from the 700 to 800 level that prevailed from mid-2012 through the end of 2014. Since that April call, the gas-equivalent rig count has stabilized. It is up 4% since then, though the gas-directed count itself is exactly what it was back then with an increase in oil-directed rigs accounting for that small overall growth.","If one assumes, as we do, a nine to 12 month lag between a rig arriving on site and gas flowing through a meter, the relevant relationship is that the current gas-equivalent rig count is down 47% versus nine months ago and 53% versus one year ago. That leads to the impact of this on natural gas supply.","In April, we were not yet sure we were seeing a decrease versus just noise, but July U.S. gas production is about 2.6 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. Though there is still noise in the system due to DUCs and other factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that we are seeing the impact of activity reductions that occurred throughout 2015. The further sharp reductions in activity versus nine to 12 months ago are not yet showing up in these already lower production numbers.","Still, the reductions we have seen, among other factors, have helped lift natural gas prices for the five-year strip, that is to say, 2017 through 2021, from a low of $2.63 per MMBtu in February, to a current level of just over $3. This price is still below our estimated equilibrium price of about $3.25 to $3.50 per MMBtu, however, these somewhat higher prices, especially in the context of our expectation of further supply declines, have caused us to conclude that this is a good time to begin the process of restoring our pace of development, adding 63 incremental wells to our 2016 drilling program. Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we are well positioned to take advantage of the low service costs currently available to us.","Another benefit of beginning this process now is that we have incremental takeaway capacity scheduled to come online in the fourth quarter this year, including 100 million cubic feet per day to the Gulf Coast with the TETCO Gulf Markets project and 650 million cubic feet per day on EQM's Ohio Valley Connector, which gets us to our REX capacity and ultimately to Midwest markets.","While we always planned on an OVC in-service date before year-end 2016, the impending reality of that pipe becoming operational certainly adds confidence to a development increase that will result in incremental 2017 sales volumes. We are getting in front of a broader industry ramp-up, which we expect when gas prices improve further. We are focusing on our better prospects, not returning to the Huron or to lesser Marcellus areas, for example, as our belief that the price recovery will continue is moderated by our somewhat rueful conclusion that the inevitable overshoot of equilibrium prices will be followed by the equally inevitable overreaction in our industry, though we do not think the industry overreaction will be as pronounced as it was a few years ago, since there is likely to be more skepticism about the enduring nature of too much of an upward move in price. We still think the best place to position ourselves is to be amongst those companies that are moving a little bit earlier in the cycle in both directions.","As a final note, while we are adding to the number of wells that we will spud in 2016, our CapEx forecast is unchanged. As you know, nearly 75% of the cost per well is for well completion. The majority of these incremental wells will be completed in 2017, so the CapEx related to completions will mostly be included in next year's CapEx budget. As for the CapEx that these new wells will incur in 2016, this increase is fully offset by the impact of lower service costs and improved drilling and completion efficiencies in the first half of 2016.","For those of you who are starting to get a better feel for 2017 numbers, our preliminary estimate is that this increase in activity will cause our 2017 sales volumes to increase from the prior estimate of 750 Bcfe to 760 Bcfe to a new estimate of roughly 800 Bcfe to 810 Bcfe. We will refine those estimates later this year.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Thank you, Dave. My focus today is to provide an update on our deep Utica program. Our two objectives for 2016 were to get costs per well down to a target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well and to achieve consistent well results with EURs of approximately 3.5 Bcf per thousand feet. If we can achieve both, returns will be as good or better than our core Marcellus wells.","Since the last call, we have one new data point to talk about. In June, we turned-in-line to Shipman well in Greene County. Shipman was fraced with ceramic proppant versus the previous two wells that were fraced with sand. The IP showed improvement over the previous two Utica wells, the Pettit and BIG 190. Our preliminary estimate is that the Shipman EUR will be between 2 Bcf per thousand feet and 3 Bcf per thousand feet which shows improvement from the Pettit and BIG 190.","On the cost side, we've also made progress as the Shipman well came in at approximately $14 million. We are pleased with our cost reductions thus far and see additional opportunities to further lower these costs. We are now estimating the costs per well in development mode to be between $12 million and $13 million.","We continue to approach the Utica as an exploration project, trying various techniques, reviewing results, repeating what worked, and trying new things in our effort to improve results, both on recoveries and costs.","We are currently fracing the West Run well in Greene County and we are again utilizing ceramic proppant on this well. We expect to turn West Run in line in August. And after West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill the BIG 177 well in Wetzel County.","We talked before about spudding 5 wells to 10 wells this year. And given the one-by-one nature of our program and our desire not get ahead of the data, we expect to end up closer to 5 wells for 2016.","We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress in the Deep Utica. And I'll now turn the call over to Pat Kane.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Thank you, Steve. Adam, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Just a question for Steve or Dave. Just your thoughts, you put the new \u2013 in the prepared comments you talked about obviously adding the wells. I'm a little surprised to see that the wells added, potentially been added in the Upper Devonian. How you think about adding \u2013 well, how you came about sort of the rationale of adding there versus just purely more activity in the Marcellus and Utica?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Hey, Neal. There is a number of factors that went into that decision. And a few of those are, since we discontinued the program about this time last year, we've brought on 38 additional Upper Devonian wells that had been spud by that time. And based on the results we're seeing, our type curve is now 18% higher on a EUR per foot basis. So the economics of Upper Devonian have improved. That's combined with approximately 14% lower well costs. And I would remind you that our view of the Upper Devonian is, it's basically a use it or lose it play. If we don't co-develop it at roughly the same time as the Marcellus, we think that reserve will effectively be lost.","So, when we look at the economics on the development of our resource base aspect versus just well-by-well economics, if we factor in these long lateral economic Upper Devonian wells and defer additional Marcellus wells for a time to make room for the Upper Devonian, we generate a lot more NPV versus drilling all Marcellus and forgoing the Upper Devonian forever. And I guess the bottom-line is the individual well returns for all of these Upper Devonian wells are well above our cost of capital. So they're economic opportunities that otherwise would be lost if we don't capture them now.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And, Steve, I assume takeaway fine in Upper or that in incremental Marcellus.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yes, yes. There's takeaway capacity for all of these wells.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly, just how you guys think about M&A right now. Just anything you're still looking is still in that designated area, if you \u2013 maybe just a little color on M&A out there, Dave, for you, or Steve?","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I don't know if we've got any further color we'd like to highlight. I mean I guess my current topic is basis, and frankly we're still just looking at Marcellus, Utica, the focus area is still that rectangle we put out, et cetera. As you're aware, since the last call, of course, we did announce and closeout a deal and I guess you're aware that there are a couple others that we did get involved in the process but other folks wound up making those acquisitions.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. Thank you, all.","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Neal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart from Scotia Howard Weil. Please, go ahead.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple of quick ones, you mentioned on the flat CapEx and increased activity at lower well costs. Do you have new numbers to give out this morning?","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Yeah. The Marcellus well will come in at $5.7 million. And we're publishing a new updated analyst presentation that will show you the new numbers.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","The $5.7 million on the Marcellus.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","And that's down from the $6.3 million, if I remember right?","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","That's right.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Great. And then maybe, Steve, on the 33 more Marcellus wells, where are those primarily located? And is any of that on the newly acquired acreage?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","No. Those 33 wells are all in Pennsylvania. It'd be Greene County, Eastern Washington County, and Southern Allegheny County. And none of those are on the new Statoil acreage at this time.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, great. And then maybe just one on basis, you came in a little bit wider than we were anticipating for the quarter, just given that I think Appalachian prices did relatively well versus NYMEX. So is there, I guess, any one-offs during the quarter and then maybe some comment on 3Q expectations?","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Well, Holly, as far as the basis, some of the recoveries end up in that net marketing line item and not...","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Yep.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","...end up in the differential line. So the net marketing was a little bit above our guidance and the differential line was a little bit below our guidance. But if you look at the two together, we're kind of right in line.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","So, again, our guidance for the rest of the year is based on our mark-to-market of our \u2013 and we do have some fixed price sales which locks in the basis at the time. And also, basically, we're marketing our book to the forward curve for all of our sales points.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, Pat. And then 3Q I guess the basis is a bit wide. But there's a lot of maintenance going on, on REX and Transco. I'm assuming that's just sort of rerouting?","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Yeah. The summer's always tougher than the full year. So you're right. Maintenance is the main factor.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay.","David L. Porges - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we'd expect you'll start to see some of the OVC impacts by the time we are reporting on fourth quarter our full year numbers.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Great. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen. Please, go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Heikkinen Energy. Just curious as it relates to Greene County specifically, what's the remaining development inventory look like in Greene County? And how would you rank the \u2013 or characterize the economics in Greene relative to the other counties in, what you call, core?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, regarding the economics, Greene is one of our better areas, but that Southern Allegheny, Eastern Washington, Greene and Northern Wetzel County area are all fairly similar in returns and that's kind of the core of the core. Overall, in the core, I think we're roughly 20% of our acreage is developed, so one-fifth of it's developed, four-fifth remains undeveloped, so still have a pretty good runway in that high-quality area.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess specific to Greene, how much would you say that's developed? Is it similar to that 20%?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","I don't have the specific number. It's probably a little more developed than that average, but not a lot, maybe 30% developed.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","I don't have that \u2013 that's a guess, so I don't have that specific number in front of me.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then I guess the only other one on my end, I'm just curious, can you \u2013 do you all have how much of the cash flow \u2013 the increase in cash flow guidance, how much of that was just price related versus other volume or cost related?","Robert J. McNally - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's primarily...","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Meaning marking to markets to (22:14) NYMEX, how much of that drove the...?","Robert J. McNally - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's primarily price-driven. I mean there's some volume increase, which we explained in the guidance, but the bigger part of the move for cash flow is price.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it right. Thank you. That's all I have. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Pat Kane, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Thank you. You may begin.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's conference call.","With me today are Dave Porges, Chief Executive Officer; Steve Schlotterbeck, the President of EQT and President of Exploration and Production; Randy Crawford, Senior Vice President of EQT and President of Midstream and Commercial; and Rob McNally, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This call will be replayed for a seven-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 p.m. Eastern today. The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415. The confirmation code is 13634047. The call will also be replayed for seven days on our website.","To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 10:30 a.m. today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20 this morning. The dial-in number for that call is 201-689-7817.","In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's first quarter 2016 results. Next, Steve will give a Utica update. And finally, Dave, will discuss certain market and strategic matters. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Randy and Rob, will all be available to answer your questions.","But first, I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations of most comparable GAAP financial measures.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob McNally.","Robert J. McNally - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Senior VP","Thanks you, Pat. Before reviewing the Q1 results, I want to review changes to our price reconciliation and production segment page. Historically, we presented the cost of gathering and transporting our gas as revenue deductions on the price reconciliation and production segment page.","Starting today, gathering, transmission and processing costs are now reported as expenses on the production segment page. The exception is that transportation charges for capacity not used to transport EQT produced gas, which is either resold or used to transport purchased gas by our marketing group, is still presented as a revenue offset in accordance with GAAP. The new net marketing services line on the production segment page includes these costs, as well as the related recoveries, both of which are now excluded from the price reconciliation.","Previously, these capacity costs, which were $0.23 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2016, were reported as a third-party gathering and transmission cost on the price reconciliation, while the marketing recoveries which were $0.26 per Mcf this quarter were presented as a component of recoveries included in the average differential.","The main change to guidance that you will see is that our differential guidance went from negative $0.40 to $0.50 per Mcf for 2016, to negative $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf. Offsetting this change to reported differential is a change in our guidance to third-party gathering and transmission expense from $0.50 per Mcf for the year to $0.30 per Mcf.","So netting these two charges, necessitated by the change in reporting format, is effectively a reiteration of our previous guidance. We've posted the historic price reconciliation for the first quarter and the 2015 results by quarter using the new format on our website. Finally, we have also posted our updated 2016 guidance conforming to the new format.","Now for an update on the remaining drop down. We're currently working through the internal process, which includes all the necessary accounting, legal and commercial work. We expect the drop down to occur in the second half of the year. As we've mentioned in the past, there's about $40 million of EBITDA to be dropped down and expect the value to be up to $300 million.","As Pat mentioned, EQT GP Holdings and EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. In this morning's release, we added a table for the calculation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. EQT recorded $82.8 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the first quarter of 2016, as compared to $47.7 million in the first quarter of 2015. We currently forecast $77 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of 2016; and $320 million for the full year, assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance.","I will now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.07, compared to $1.07 in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT decreased to $156 million, as compared to $218.6 million in the first quarter of 2015.","The high-level of story for the first quarter was strong volume growth and a lower commodity price environment. We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record gathering volumes at Midstream.","With the exception of a $3.8 million Huron restructuring charge, the first quarter was very straightforward. So I'll keep my remarks fairly brief.","The story at EQT production continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 179.9 Bcfe in the recently completed quarter was 24% higher than the first quarter of 2015; and 16% higher than fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price was $2.63 per Mcfe, compared to $4.06 per Mcfe in the first quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of price in the tables in this morning's press release.","Net marketing services revenue totaled $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2016; $8.6 million lower than the same quarter last year due to incremental capacity costs in the current quarter and colder weather in 2015.","Total operating expenses at EQT production were $489.3 million or 7% higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes were lower for the quarter as a result of lower prices.","Moving on to Midstream results, operating income here was $141.9 million, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $224.7 million, $16.5 million than the first quarter of last year, as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses were $82.9 million, $4.4 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of our continuing growth in the Midstream business.","And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position, with zero net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver; and about $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM and EQGP. We currently forecast $600 million to $650 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes approximately $150 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Thank you, Rob. My focus today is to provide an update on our Deep Utica program. Our two objectives for 2016 are to get our cost per well down to our target range of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well; and to achieve consistent well results, in line with the median of wells drilled in the Deep Utica by EQT and our peers so far.","For the Utica to compete for capital with the Marcellus, we are targeting EURs approximately 75% higher than our core Marcellus wells. The higher EUR per well, combined with a higher percentage of the EUR being produced in the first few years and lower expected gathering and compression costs should provide returns competitive with the Marcellus.","We currently have three wells producing, the Scotts Run and Pettit wells in Greene County, Pennsylvania; and the BIG 190 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia. The Scotts Run well began declining at the end of March after producing at a flat rate of 30 million cubic feet per day since July of 2015, which was a total of 244 days. The decline is in line with our expectations; and our EUR estimate for this well is currently 20 Bcf, or approximately 6 Bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral.","The results of the Pettit and BIG 190 wells, while not as strong as our Scotts Run well, are in line with what we are seeing from other wells in the area. It is too early to calculate an EUR for these two wells.","The Shipman well was spud in January and is currently being fracked, while the West Run well was spud in April. After West Run, we plan to move back to West Virginia to drill another well in Wetzel County, probably be called the BIG 177.","We used ceramic proppant on the Scotts Run and achieved superior results compared to the Pettit and BIG 190 wells, which use sand as the proppant. It is not clear that the proppant difference explains the results, but we've decided to use ceramic proppant in the next three completions, including the Shipman, to determine if the proppant type has an impact on well productivity.","The good news is we've negotiated a 40% reduction in the price of ceramic proppant since the Scotts Run well. For a typical 5,400 foot lateral, the incremental cost of using ceramics versus sand is now $1.4 million per well, compared to about $2.5 million incrementally at the time we drilled the Scotts Run.","On the cost side, we continue to see significant improvement. Drilling costs continue to come down as we gain experience and improve the techniques and equipment used to drill these wells.","On the completions side, we will be testing dissolvable plug technology for the first time on the Shipman well. We estimate that this technology will save us an additional $700,000 per well, if successful.","Our team continues to safely reduce the cost of these wells and is confident we can achieve our target well costs, even with ceramic proppant. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on our progress in the Deep Utica.","And I'll now turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve. I would like to briefly provide two updates and one other comment on today's call. The first update is to my comments in our February call regarding rig count as a leading indicator of production.","At that time, there were 246 gas-equivalent rigs, down from the stable level of 700 to 800 that prevailed from about mid-2012 through the end of 2014. Since that February call, the gas-equivalent rig count declined by another 29% to 174 gas-equivalent rigs today. This means we are now down 57% in the past year and 76% since the end of 2014.","We are beginning to see what appear to be some signs of a supply reduction, as April U.S. gas production is about 2 Bcf per day lower than the February peak. While those end 2014 rig count probably represented far too much development activity, the plateauing and beginning of a decline in production suggests that our thesis of higher future natural gas prices still looks just as solid, even though we confess that the timing of any meaningful price increase continues to be uncertain.","Given our capital strength and the fact that we have not had to make dramatic reductions in staff, we continue to be well-positioned comparatively to adjust our development plans, should higher prices materialize.","I do personally continue to believe that the eventual price increase will likely eventually overshoot the equilibrium price necessary to balance supply with demand, but that just means we will have to be as disciplined in a more constructive economic environment, as we have been in the current less than constructive economic environment.","On a related update, we continue to look to add to our core acreage position, but have not yet announced any transactions. The good news is that there are many high-quality asset packages being marketed in our core focus area. Along those lines, so that we do not have to break with our practice of not commenting on specific transactions, we wanted to provide some insight into the types of assets that we are examining.","If you look at our website for a hard copy of our most recent investor presentation, you will see a pretty clearly delineated version of our core area; all of which is in the southwestern portion of the Marcellus play.","If you become aware of opportunities that are largely or entirely within our core, you can safely assume that we are looking or have looked at the opportunity. You can equally safely assume that we are not looking at and not interested in looking at opportunities that lie outside our core area; again, as defined by that rectangle in our current Investor Presentation.","To expand on that somewhat, we further look closely at the number of drilling locations and potential feet of pay in those locations that represent a combination of EQT's existing acreage and development opportunities and those provided by the target; true synergies, if you will.","My final comment pertains to an area of financial risk that I focused on early in my time at EQT, my philosophical objection to shareholder's bearing the investment risks of employee's portfolios via defined benefit pension plan. The pension benefit obligation was about $150 million when I arrived at EQT, that was many years ago, and was forecast to be multiples higher than that within a decade.","As a result, I wanted to reduce the extent of the associated investment risk. We said about shrinking the plan over the years; and as a result, we were able to apply for and just recently received approval to finally terminate the remaining vestiges of the plan altogether. There will be a modest charge recorded, possibly as soon as the second quarter, but we will have finally brought that obligation and the risk associated with it down to zero.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Thank you, Dave. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Adam, can you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Phillip Jungwirth from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Good morning. With more production history on the Scotts Run Utica well, how are you thinking about drainage and reconciling the EUR estimates to some of the gas in place estimates out there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Phil, this is Steve. I think we're still exploring that. So it is still a fairly anomalous well in terms of how productive it's been. So clearly there's really two areas of focus. One is the size of the \u2013 the drainage area size, so the size of box that we're drawing from. Since it's a reservoir, we don't have a lot of experience with it yet. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty about what the right drainage area is. And then there are still some questions about basically the density of the gas in the reservoir, so how much can fit inside a given box at these fairly extreme pressures we're dealing with.","So without getting too technical, the behavior of a real gas versus hypothetical gases can vary quite a bit as pressures get into these levels. So there's some uncertainty about how do you correct for that. So we have a number of experiments and tests going on in both of those areas. But I would say, bottom line is, it's still too early for us to have a good sense for what a recovery factor would be or what proper spacing would be; and, in fact, what's really driving the extreme productivity we're seeing.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. And then it's been a couple of quarters since you've talked about the value of having both the Upstream and the Midstream business together and had previously commented that as EQT's production growth rate slows and EQM's third-party growth accelerates, the synergies of having the two units together is reduced. Just wondering, in the past year and looking out to 2017 as growth does slow, has your view of the magnitude of these synergies changed at all or are they still as great as they were in 2015?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Directionally, I'd say they're \u2013 this is Dave \u2013 they're still about the same. I mean you know my view all along has been there's always going to be pressures pulling apart two groups that have cash flows that have different attributes. But I think in this environment we're actually seeing more of the synergies between the Upstream and the Midstream than we probably would have expected a couple of years ago; and I'm thinking particularly about some of the pipeline projects.","But then also kind of going back to the Utica, we do believe that it's still likely that we'd want a somewhat dedicated, at least, Midstream business for the Utica. And, of course, we're taking a look at what that might look like at least, let's say, upstream of the first compressor station. And to be able to coordinate the development of the Upstream and the development of the Midstream is a benefit that we have that we don't think is available to those who are just pure play on one side or the other.","And, frankly, on the FERC regulated pipelines, I think you see a disconnect in some circumstances between what the pipelines are saying and what the producer shippers are saying; and you don't see that with us. So I think that's another case where having the synergies between the Upstream and the Midstream works to create value over time for the EQT shareholder.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. Great. And then you talked about last quarter a nat gas clearing price of $3.50 and wanting to be able to quickly respond to higher prices. Strips moved up $0.20 or $0.30 since that call. But it does feel like, to your point, 2017 supply-demand fundamentals are improving. So the question is, is $3.50 a clearing price that would trigger EQT to increase activity or to be lower, given that you're the low-cost producer? And given the historical nine-month spud to sales time, is there a way to more quickly respond to higher prices?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The ability to more quickly respond in both directions is certainly something that we're looking at, but I wouldn't say that we're at a point now where the prices are where we would want them to be. I mean to use the analogy that a lot of us have used that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and we're a little more confident that it's not attached to the front of a train. But I don't know that we want to be going all-in on that possibility.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart from Scotia Howard. Please go ahead.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You changed your name. Is there an announcement you want to make?","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Not today. Dave, first question \u2013 appreciate the comments on the M&A \u2013 and without talking about specifics, just kind of curious if you can comment on the size of deals, the quantities of deals and then how you balance that versus keeping the investment grade rating?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll provide a little bit of comment and Steve might want to provide comment too. For the most part, we happen to be focused on transactions that are relatively small in nature. They're not public company transactions. That's just the nature of what happens to be out there. And we do still think that it makes sense for us to be cognizant of credit risk when we look at those acquisitions; and I guess maybe I'll just leave it at that.","And, frankly, it is more beneficial on the Midstream side than the Upstream. I think we've seen plenty of peers that have lower credit ratings than us and I don't think it \u2013 I mean just a little bit lower, high sub-investment grade. I think you could easily argue it doesn't hurt them. But on the Midstream side, I think, to have a seat at the table \u2013 and I do see a lot of opportunities, maybe even more opportunities than we would have before with the changes in the macro environment and how it's affecting a lot of the other companies out there \u2013 I still think it's valuable, in this environment, to maintain that investment grade rating and assume that we will behave in a manner that is consistent with that view.","And I don't know, Steve, do you want to provide any more thoughts on what you're seeing in the M&A landscape?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. Dave, the only thing I would add, really \u2013 probably reiterate points Dave has already made, but we focus mainly on asset packages. We have a very narrow core area that we think is interesting. So the things that are interesting to us are asset packages that fit nicely with our existing Upstream and Midstream assets where, as Dave said, we get those true synergies. And I think there's a number of those packages out there right now; some are on the market; some we're just in discussions directly with companies.","So we're looking at a lot of stuff. We're really hoping to find things where we have more synergies than our competitors, which allows us to be competitive on price, yet get it at a price that still leaves a lot of value for our shareholders. So in this environment, there seems to be several opportunities that are interesting; and we continue to pursue them. But if the price isn't right, we won't do it.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Great. Appreciate that. And then maybe moving on to some of the guidance. I know there was a change in disclosure, so I want to make sure we have apples-to-apples comparisons here on the basis. But we've noticed that basis has really been narrowing. So curious as to the 2Q guidance and kind of what you guys are seeing \u2013 maybe this is for Randy \u2013 on the marketing and the basis side of things right now?","Randall L. Crawford - SVP and President, Midstream & Commercial; COO & EVP, EQT Midstream Partners LP","Holly, this is Randy. Yeah, the basis has been narrowing a bit. And so, obviously, the additional infrastructure that will be coming on into the fourth quarter and our Ohio Valley Connector project that we're constructing currently will obviously help us in our realized price throughout 2016 or in the end of 2016.","But in terms of the guidance and some of the accounting, I think Rob addressed it pretty clearly in his comments about some of the change in the accounting related to that. But we've been pretty much right on our guidance. And I give the commercial team a lot of credit for optimizing the capacity in what was a first quarter of essentially warmer weather, so they did an excellent job in meeting that guidance.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Yeah. Okay. And then maybe one last one for Steve. Steve, it looks like, for 2016, your guidance is sort of tracking maybe a similar quarterly progression that you did in 2015. Is that sort of how to think about it here for the remaining three quarters?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, I don't have the 2015 numbers in front of me, but to be at the midpoint of our guidance implies fairly flat production through the balance of the year. So that's probably how I'd be looking at it.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Say, maybe a question for Steve. Steve, you talked about bringing those costs down in those Utica wells. I'm just wondering, how do you balance the completion and optimizations. I know you guys are certainly doing some exciting things there. How do you think about sort of balancing that, doing some enhancements there while at the same time bringing the cost down. Just wondering kind of what sort of levers you're pulling there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, I think our thought process on that is we are definitely trying to figure out how to get the cost down, with the idea of what the ongoing development mode costs would be. But to the extent that we need to run some experiments or gather data to get a better understanding of the reservoir at this point, and \u2013 sort of the nature of the effort is kind of a science project still at this point or more exploratory in nature, we're very willing to make those investments. And we understand that those are not intended to be ongoing types of costs. Those are one-time costs to cut a core, to get a specialty log, to run some sort of reservoir test. So I don't think we let that get in the way. We're certainly not avoiding gathering necessary data in order to get any single well's cost below some artificial threshold.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, okay. That's where I was going with that. And then, Steve, I know on that rectangle, and I respect Dave's question, kind of where you guys are looking on that slide. I know you've got a pad just north of that. And then even quite a bit further north of that I know one of your peers had obviously a big well. So you've got a bit of a position just even if you continue going north just a little bit further than that. Are you definitely kind of sticking to that rectangle or would you consider a bit, just a bit north of that? I guess northeast of that, it would be.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","You mean in terms of M&A?","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes, sir.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","No. I think we're going to stay focused in that rectangle. There is enough potential opportunities in that rectangle, and that's where we get the most synergies. We do have some acreage to the north of it in Armstrong County. I think is that what you're referencing?","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's what I was referencing. That's exactly right.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. But I think our Midstream operation is focused south of Pittsburgh, Greene County, Wetzel County. And I'd say the areas south of Pittsburgh in that rectangle are of primary interest. And once you get north of Pittsburgh, even in that rectangle, we're certainly interested in things that come along. But once you venture beyond it, I think at least for now it is not particularly of interest.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly, you mentioned to Holly I think on kind of that production assuming we'd stay on the guidance pretty flat. Have you said \u2013 I'm just trying to make sure I have this right as far as for the remainder of the year kind of what you're thinking as far as number of Marcellus versus Utica wells. I'm not sure if I've got that correct.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Yeah. Neal, we're drilling 71 or 72 Marcellus wells and five Utica wells this year with the potential to get a pad (29:16).","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. That's what I was getting at. Got it, got it. Thanks, Pat.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to follow-up on your comments on ceramic and its potential superiority or improving performance in the Utica. Can you talk a little bit more about the reasons for why this may be? And then also, is it something that is unique to the Utica section or do you see the potential for further completion efficiency improvements using ceramic in the Marcellus as well?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Brian, I think it's \u2013 we believe if ceramic is a driver in productivity, which at this point is still an unknown but it's one clear variable between the wells, we don't think it would apply to the Marcellus. The real driver behind the ceramic and the reason we went with it on the first well is, at these depths, with the stresses we're dealing with, the strength of the sand we use is \u2013 we're pushing the upper limit of it.","We did some laboratory testing of the sand that suggested it should be okay, which is why we switched on the second and third well. But the results we're seeing indicate that potentially it's a problem. It's mostly due to crushing and\/or embedment of the sand into the shale; mostly crushing that we're concerned about.","So the ceramic proppant has a higher crush strength, and we think that's not a problem. Again, we're not certain that it is a problem with sand. But since that's an obvious variable between the Scotts Run and the other wells and the cost differential's been cut nearly in half, we thought it was wise to go back and see how much productivity difference that's driving.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Do you view the cost differential as secular or cyclical just because of the decline in activity, particularly for ceramic elsewhere?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","I think we'll be able to maintain that cost advantage. We actually got that by talking to a second ceramic provider; and the primary provider or the provider on the Scotts Run then did come in with a much better price. So I think we've got some competition in the space now. And I think if Deep Utica full development mode kind of kicks in in the basin, there'll be enough demand for them to justify getting the ceramic up here. So I expect that we'll be able to hold on to that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then shifting a little bit to production and the macro, but you've talked in the past about the lead time from when EQT's reactivity and CapEx activity comes down to when you would actually see the production impact. And I think you've talked about it being kind of nine months plus which is, in part, is why the production stayed strong, relatively strong this year. Can you just provide any updates on that lead time, whether it's shrinking or expanding? And then to the degree that you ramp up or decide to recommit capital, does that work on the other direction as well or would there be some reason to suggest we would see the production response with a shorter lead time?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, I think, Brian, when we do our modeling \u2013 or with our current process of how we drill and complete the wells, the nine months is a pretty average. Smaller pads, shorter laterals end up being shorter; bigger pads take longer. We have done some optimization modeling of that to see what we could do to shorten it up. And we do have some options where if we had the right economic incentives, we could spend a little bit more money, primarily on more rig moves.","So we'd move the rig more often and get wells online quicker that we \u2013 and again, it would be based on the forward curve and what we thought the prices were going to do, so whether it would be worth spending the extra money. But we do have a plan in place where we could shorten that up, probably maybe to five months or six months might be the best we could get to try and capture an improving commodity market if we saw that happening.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But you know \u2013 and this is Dave \u2013 if we look at the market more broadly, we actually think there could be factors that could lengthen that lag time for a number of companies, I mean if you've gotten rid of some of your land people, for instance, and you can't get permits as easily, some of the rigs that have been laid down and maybe they've been cannibalized for parts, crews that have kind of wandered off. It's one of the reasons we've tried to remain a little bit more consistent in our activity levels so that we would be better positioned for that. So I have a feeling that the rest of the market might actually see longer lead times at the early stages of a ramp up, assuming prices move up enough to justify such a ramp up at some point in the future.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So the market will have some struggle with this. EQT is a little bit better positioned if not very well-positioned in your mind to not have that issue.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Look, there may be other peers who are in similar situation to us, but we think the market, at large, is probably going to \u2013 I think the market at large is going to have longer lead times; and EQT and probably a handful of other companies would not be subject to some of those issues.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Steve, I was wondering you all indicated that the third well, I guess the BIG 190 had similar results to the Pettit well, if I understood your comments correctly. Is there any quantifiable number you can kind of provide on what some of the initial relative productivity was and some of the back pressure data on that? And then also just to get a sense of how you all are progressing on the cost side of things. What did the cost on the BIG 190 look like, it came in at, and what's the AFE on this next one, the Shipman well you're going to be drilling?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. Scott, we're not prepared to provide any specific details on the BIG 190 yet. It's just too soon in terms of the productivity. On the cost side, it came in normalized for 5,400 foot lateral. It came in, I think, just $100,000 or $200,000 above the $14 million upper end of our range. We expect the Shipman well to come in within that range, so below $14 million; excluding some of the science we're going to do on well.","So Neal had asked earlier, we are cutting a core on the Shipman well, so there'll be some extra costs there. But if you exclude that, we expect the Shipman well to be within the range. And then things like the dissolvable frac plugs, if that works, we can implement it on future wells across the whole well. That's roughly $700,000 savings that we haven't factored in yet. So very, very confident that we're going to be in the midpoint of that range over the next few wells and with still lots of opportunity for improvement. So I think, over time, feeling pretty good about the bottom end of that range.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. And just to clarify. So the rate around $14 million for Shipman includes the cost of ceramics, but doesn't include dissolvable plug benefit?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yes.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. Okay. Thanks. And then BIG 190, how long has that been online now?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","I don't remember, maybe a month, month-and-a-half.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, okay, okay. And then really quickly looking at hedging, what is big picture like when you look at the forward curve, where's the level where you all feel more comfortable layering hedges. And would you do it more to just protect the downside or how does that strategy for you guys look going forward?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Well, look, we do take a portfolio approach, there's no doubt. When the price is below what we think is the economic clearing price, we tend to be more at the low end of the target range that we have; and when the price moves above that, we're more at the high end. So now I'd say we're probably a little bit more, as we think about it not for 2016, but as you look beyond it, we'd still be layering hedges in, but we'd be staying more at the low end of what our target range would be.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","And then again, I think the difficulty is going to be, since I do believe prices are going to move past that, that the economic clearing price to be disciplined about moving up to the top, as opposed to getting caught up with kind of the opposite of the current, if you will, depressed feeling in the market. We've seen it before where it gets euphoric. Incidentally, when you talk about the current year, we have tended to view that as being just a standard commercial activity. So we let our commercial group make decisions about the things that they want to do in year to take advantage of some of the opportunities that they see. We don't really view that as hedging so much as just normal commercial activity.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then typically are you going to target \u2013 and I think \u2013 and correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 you typically like to utilize swaps, is that right?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. But that's just because of the way the market has been. We're certainly not opposed to using other instruments, whether on their own or embedded in the sale of the physical commodity. It just all depends on what the market looks like. So you don't want to be buying a lot of options if it's volatile. You'd rather sell them, right, so that you'd say, well, we're not going to buy floors if it's expensive to do so. You'd tend to go more with swaps and vice versa. So it's much more market conditions, I'd say. It's not a philosophical view that we should be using swaps, as opposed to options or as opposed to collars.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Understood. Appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, everyone. I just have some two bigger picture questions, as I try to figure out realized pricing for your E&P segment going forward. But in recent weeks we've heard a number of pipeline projects out of the Marcellus getting delayed due to the regulatory process, or being canceled altogether. Can you talk about what you think the spillover effects from this will be with respect to basis differentials beyond 2016? Especially with the crosscurrent of production starting to roll over and maybe NYMEX prices going up, potential opportunities for your projects and what this all ultimately means for the production outlook in the Marcellus\/Utica?","Randall L. Crawford - SVP and President, Midstream & Commercial; COO & EVP, EQT Midstream Partners LP","Well, Christine, this is Randy. Certainly, in the Marcellus and Utica, we're really talking about the rate of growth slowing. So there has certainly been continued growth; and the facts are that there have been infrastructure projects that are being delayed. So in a bigger picture, as you asked, in terms of EQT, I think we're very well-positioned. The fact is that we have a broad portfolio of upstream capacity. And we have the Ohio Valley Connector project that is currently in construction that we anticipate or expect to come online at the end of this year, which will tie into our REX capacity and improve our pricing from that standpoint.","Now from the Midstream's perspective, obviously as we've planned out these projects and built out our hub and are executing accordingly, we think that obviously increases the value of those assets over the long-term and even in the short-term. So I think certainly as other projects are challenged, I think we're very well-positioned to continue to grow and to improve our realized pricing at EQT.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just on \u2013 in your presentation, your slide for the Marcellus capacity stops at first quarter 2018. So when Mountain Valley Pipe comes on, can you remind us, are you going to be taking all that capacity day one or ramp into it on a contractual basis? And because you are underpinning a large amount of capacity there, does some of your existing firm capacity on other pipes roll off so that you don't have all this excess capacity overnight and you can redirect your volumes to a better market, so pricing in theory is better for the E&P segment? Or do you take all of it day one and then you release whatever capacity you're not using on a short-term basis while you grow into it, which I think is what you've historically done. Can you just remind us how that works?","Randall L. Crawford - SVP and President, Midstream & Commercial; COO & EVP, EQT Midstream Partners LP","Sure. When MVP does come online, the capacity obligations do not ramp up; they start at that time. Having said that, we have the option to continue to keep all of the capacity and to grow into it. We also have a variety of expirations on other transportation contracts. So it provides us the flexibility, if you will, to reconfigure that portfolio at the time that the MVP comes on, or to maintain all of the capacity if at that time we need it for continued growth. So as we've positioned our portfolio with the anticipation of MVP coming on, we have a variety of different expirations on other upstream pipelines that allow us the flexibility to really optimize that portfolio.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Between now and actually like when the pipe is supposed to come online, do you have a number off the top of your head of how much is expiring?","Randall L. Crawford - SVP and President, Midstream & Commercial; COO & EVP, EQT Midstream Partners LP","I don't have it in front of me, but there are a couple of contracts that do come off in 2018. There's $200 million on TETCO that I have; and there's some other additional capacity that comes off shortly thereafter that is probably in the range of around $300 million to $400 million a day. So there's a lot of flexibility within it and we also have the right to extend those contracts too. So I think we're in a very good position to be flexible.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I had a bigger picture question. The stock at the EQT level trades at a pretty meaningful discount to your Appalachian peers. So just wondering if you think you're getting the right or the appropriate credit for having the Midstream? And maybe some longer term thoughts about, if you don't believe the market is giving you appropriate credit, ways where you could get that value from EQM?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Dave, and I do agree with your premise; and it is difficult at this point to differentiate between a couple of factors that might both be at work. One of them is that conglomerate issue that we chatted about before, different investors from Midstream and Upstream. That is certainly a possibility. And I think we all know the best way to go about resolving that kind of issue over time.","And then the other, I think, possibility is that people look at the EQGP price and they aren't sure given the relative lack of float, whether that's a good marker to be using for the Midstream value at EQT. And I think we've also been pretty clear that we've got a notion that over time having more float out there is going to be a way to get more confidence level, if that's going on. Now I also happen to think that EQGP, though I notice that it's now trading after the whole market has had a tough period since its IPO of almost a year ago, it is now trading just a little bit above its \u2013 just above its IPO price.","I still think that that represents a discount on EQGP. And I believe, and I think I've said this before, that I fear that some of that is just kind of a reverse \u2013 I mean like a sticker shock that folks models on growth, et cetera, would have suggested higher valuation for EQGP, but the current yield is still \u2013 that falls out of those calculations is a relatively low number; and there's a concern about bidding the price up such that that current yield drops too much.","But I think as you continue to see distribution increases announced consistent with our guidance at the EQGP level, that that will tend to go away and that aspect of the valuation discount will start to be dealt with. But as far as some of those other issues that I've mentioned, yeah, we do work through those issues, we do see it the same way that you do. And we're kind of working through our alternatives on how to make sure that our shareholders realize that full value.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But you talked about that conglomerate discount. To resolve that I would assume that is a longer term decision that you'd have to make on that, nothing in the intermediate term on that?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm not going to get into any timing issues on when we do some of that. I think we all understand what those conglomerate discounts, what those are and the ultimate ways of resolving those. And I don't know that I'd want to go any further than that. There's a lot of times that what you want to do depends on the market conditions at the time.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's fair. That's fair...","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not trying to guide you to towards or away from any particular timing on any actions that we might take with regard to that.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's fair. That's clear. And just secondly, I know you guys have talked about doing five Deep Utica wells in the 2016 budget, and I think you gave yourself some potential to expand that. Are you still right now planning to do five and when could you potentially talk about expanding that if you decide to do so?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - President, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. Right now the plan is still five. But the actual number we end up drilling in the year is going to be very much based on the results we're seeing. And we want to be very careful about not getting ahead of our science, nor getting ahead of our ability to take the gas away and get it to a market. But we also want to progress our understanding and start to make some decisions about what the development mode of the Utica might look like.","So I think for sure we're going to get the shipment well fracked, which we're currently fracking, and get results from it. It will give us a lot of information on the impact of ceramic proppants. We'll get some information on use of the dissolvable plug. So we might be able to take another step forward in our estimation of cost and therefore economics. So it's going to be kind of a decide-as-we-go kind of approach I think. But certainly don't expect to be making any decisions before mid to late summer in terms of any sort of a ramp up.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, gents.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time.

Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such financial measures including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure.","Before turning the call over to Phil, I'll walk you through one of the non-GAAP reconciliations that caused some confusion last quarter, specifically production adjusted net operating revenue presented on page seven of today's release. This number is used as a basis for calculating our average realized sales price as presented on the price reconciliation included in this morning's release. The average realized price is calculated by dividing the adjusted net operating revenue by total sales volumes.","There is a non-GAAP reconciliation in the release that I will briefly explain. We are making two adjustments to EQT Production total operating revenues as reported on the segment page in order to provide you with operating revenues excluding the non-cash impact of derivatives and the net of transportation and processing costs.","With respect to derivatives, adjustments for non-cash derivative activity have been the subject of SEC comments over the past couple of years. As a result, in accordance with what appears to be the SEC preference in this area, we adjust out the non-cash activity in three steps. First, we back up all gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges that were included in revenues during the period, which is the mark-to-market impact which was $160.5 million this quarter. Two, we add back the actual cash received, $33.2 million, and deducted premiums paid for derivatives that settled during the quarter, which was $1 million. This leaves us with just the actual cash received net of any premiums paid in our adjusted revenue number.","The final adjustment on our non-GAAP reconciliation simply reduces the total operating revenues by $64.7 million of cost reported as expense on EQT Production segment page for transportation and processing. This provides a realized price net of transportation and processing cost which is consistent with our historic presentation.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Pat, and good morning everyone. As you read the press release this morning, EQT announced the third quarter 2015 adjusted loss of $0.33 per diluted share, which represents an $0.83 per share decrease from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow was $156.3 million in the quarter or 46% lower than the third quarter of 2014. Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by lower commodity prices due to lower strip prices since the last quarter. We also recorded a significant non-cash gain on hedges of future production of $128.3 million during the quarter and that was some of the stuff that Pat just talked about and that's excluded from the adjusted earnings and cash flow.","I'd like to briefly take a look at our continuing investment in the recently IPO'ed EQGP. On October 20, 2015, EQGP announced a cash distribution to its unit holders of $0.104 per unit for the third quarter of 2015 or a 13% increase over the equivalent full quarter distribution in the second quarter of 2015. The third quarter distribution decision represents $24.9 million in payments which EQT will receive on November 23. These quarterly payments will continue to grow as distributions at EQGP grow, and they highlight the value of EQGP to EQT.","The operational results were fairly straightforward in the third quarter, so I'll move right into the segment results, and I will be brief. First, EQT Production continued to grow production sales volumes by 27% compared to the third quarter of 2014. However, revenues from that growth were more than offset by the lower commodity prices negatively impacting results in the third quarter. The average realized price at EQT Production was $1.21 per Mcf equivalent, a 55% decrease from $2.69 per Mcf equivalent last year, which led to adjusted operating revenues for the quarter of $188.5 million or $142.5 million lower than last year's third quarter.","There were many factors that led to the lower price but lower NYMEX and liquids prices versus last year were the primary drivers. You will find the detailed components of the price differences in the tables in this morning's release.","The adjusted operating loss at EQT Production was $72 million, excluding the non-cash gain on hedges of $128.3 million as I just mentioned. That compares to adjusted operating income of $107.9 million in the third quarter of 2014 and that was also excluding a non-cash gain on hedges.","Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $325.2 million or $53.5 million higher compared to the third quarter 2014. DD&A was $30.2 million higher, transportation and processing expense was about $16 million higher, exploration expense was $4.6 million higher, and LOE, excluding production taxes, was about $1.6 million higher, all consistent with the volume growth. Production tax decreased by $3 million due to lower commodity prices in the period. SG&A expense excluding $3.5 million in rig release penalties was about $0.5 million higher.","Midstream results. Here, the operating income was up 21%. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased fixed capacity-based transmission charges. Gathering revenues increased 23% to $125.9 million in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to a 24% increase in gathered volumes.","Transmission revenues for the third quarter 2015 increased by $6.9 million or 12% driven by additional firm-contracted capacity added over the past year. Operating expenses at Midstream for the third quarter of $82.2 million were about $9.4 million higher than last year consistent with the growth in the Midstream business.","And just to conclude with a brief note on liquidity, EQT did have $1.7 billion of cash on hand at quarter-end not including cash at EQM and EQGP, as well as full availability under EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility. So, we remain in a strong liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future. Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow is $900 million adjusted to exclude the non-controlling interest portion of EQM and EQGP's cash flow.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive Vice President and President of Exploration & Production","Thank you, Phil. Today, I'll provide you an update on our deep Utica well program. As discussed on the last call, we completed our first deep Utica well in July, the Scotts Run 591340. To remind you, the well's initial 24-hour flow was 72.9 million cubic feet with an average flowing casing pressure of 8,641 psi. We've been flowing this well directly into the sales pipeline at a choke-restricted rate of about 30 million cubic feet per day.","Except for the seven days required to install the wellhead equipment, daily sales have been steady at this rate. Casing pressure has been declining at an average of 40 psi per day. As of yesterday, sales volumes were 30.4 million cubic feet per day, and the casing pressure was 6,320 psi.","Cumulative production from this well has totaled 2.6 Bcf in the first 86 days of production. Our expectation is that the daily production rate will not decline until the well pressure declines to the pipeline pressure, which is 500 psi. Based on an extrapolation of the current pressure decline rate, we estimate that we'll reach line pressure after approximately eight months of production, which will be at late March 2016. The cumulative production at that time would be approximately 7.4 Bcf. At that point, we have a wide range of possible decline curves as we do not have any analogous decline data to rely on. Our current reservoir modeling suggests an ultimate expected recovery for this well in a range between 13.9 Bcf and 18.8 Bcf or a range of 4.3 Bcf to 5.9 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral.","Using the lowest EUR of our range and assuming the high end of our cost per well target of between $12.5 million and $14 million per well we estimate returns at a $2 wellhead gas price to be north of 20% for a 5,400 foot lateral well.","Since the last call, we have exploit two additional Utica wells. In August, we exploit the second Greene County well, the Pettit #593066 which is located approximately five miles northeast of the Scotts Run well. They're currently at a depth of 12,200 feet, and we installed the intermediate casing. We're just beginning to drill a curve on this well and expect this well to be in line before the end of the mid-year.","The third well was spud in September in Wetzel County, West Virginia, the Big 190 well, and is located approximately 30 miles southwest of the Scotts Run well. We reached TD of the deep intermediate hole. The top hole rig has been moved off the well and the well is secured awaiting the Big rig to run the intermediate casing. The rest of the drilling will be completed when the Greene County rig is finished with the Pettit well, and that rig is moved to West Virginia later this year.","We're making good progress on cost reductions for these wells. Specifically at the current depth of the Pettit well, we spend approximately 22% less than we did on the Scotts Run well at the same point. As I previously noted, we expected to take several wells for us to achieve our cost target for these wells of between $12.5 million and $14 million. We are pleased with our progress so far and remain confident that we will achieve our targeted cost.","We will continue to post well data from the Scotts Run well on our analyst presentation periodically, and we'll update you on the progress of the latest two wells as warranted.","I will now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his initial thoughts for next year's capital budget.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. Today the topic of my prepared remarks, as Steve mentioned, is our preliminary thinking regarding EQT's 2016 capital budget. We met with our board last week to discuss our long-term strategy, as we do every October. We will then meet in early December to approve the upcoming year's operating plan and capital budget.","A key aspect of the discussion in last week's meeting was the impact of the emerging deep Utica play on EQT's strategy. There have been fewer than 10 wells drilled and completed in the deep Utica around our acreage, so it is still too early to be confident that the play will be economic, but the early results are certainly encouraging. Specifically, if the Utica does work, which for us means that the returns are better than returns from the core Marcellus, we will certainly add significant resource potential to our inventory. However, the clearing price for natural gas will likely be lower in that scenario than if the Utica is less economic. As a result, some of our other inventory that requires higher prices to make economic returns would be deferred possibly for many years. So, while those of us, certainly including EQT, who have significant position in the core of the deep Utica will be the winners, if you will, the cannibalization of other opportunities will affect everyone including those of us who will net-net be much better off if the deep Utica play does work economically.","Given this potential for lower long-term gas prices, we do not think it's prudent to invest much money in wells whose all-in after-tax returns exceed our investment hurdle rates by only a relatively small amount. As a result, we are suspending drilling in those areas such as Central Pennsylvania and Upper Devonian play that are outside that core. This decision will affect our 2016 capital plan though we are just starting to develop the specifics of the 2016 drilling program that forms the core of that plan. The focus in 2016 will be on this more narrowly-drawn notion of what the core Marcellus would be assuming the deep Utica play works.","We will also pursue the deep Utica play with a goal of determining economics, size of resource that midstream needs and on lowering the cost per well to our target range. Our initial thoughts are a 10 well to 15-well deep Utica program in 2016 with flexibility to shift capital between Marcellus and Utica as warranted based on our progress.","Our preliminary estimate for production volume growth in 2016 versus 2015 is 15% to 20% which we will refine when we announce our formal development plan at early December. If we turn in line our fourth quarter wells in late December, as contemplated in our fourth quarter guidance, 2016 growth would likely be near the upper end of that range as those wells would contribute little if anything to volumes until early 2016. Obviously, this overall approach will result in a 2016 capital budget, absent any acquisitions that is a fair bit lower than 2015 and would result in continuing (16:28) of cash on hand as of end 2016 but we will provide specifics in December.","Another strategic implication of an economic deep Utica play is the significant opportunity for EQM. A year ago, it would have been hard to imagine a more prolific play than the Marcellus. And EQM has already announced the $3 billion backlog of midstream in projects to serve the Marcellus play. Incidentally, that entire current backlog continues to make sense if the deep Utica proves economic as it either supports core Marcellus or takeaway projects that are needed regardless of the source rock for the natural gas. However, if the deep Utica works, it is likely to be larger than the Marcellus over time. The magnitude of incremental takeaway and gathering pipeline such as a play would support is significant, even net of the previously mentioned reductions in Marcellus development that would occur in this scenario.","As we think about the EQT corporate structure, we are not likely to make any major decisions to change to current integrated model until we do understand the scope of a potential deep Utica development program. We have reaped much value in recent years from having the two businesses together and there is the potential that both companies would continue to benefit from the synergies into the dawn of the Utica era.","Finally, the deep Utica potential has also affected our thoughts around acreage acquisitions. Given our view that our existing acreage sits on what is expected to be the core of the core in deep Utica, we are focusing our area of interest even more tightly on acreage that is in our core Marcellus and potentially core deep Utica area. As you can probably deduce from the lack of significant transaction announcements, the bid\/ask spread continues to be wide.","We are a patient company and believe that there will be acreage available at fair prices eventually. But the definition of fair has to contemplate the potential that the deep Utica works. We do not think that bodes well for that price of acreage concentrated in anything but the core Marcellus and core Utica. This narrowing focus also suggests that smaller asset deals are much more likely than larger corporate deals. However, as we have stated previously, we are comfortable maintaining our industry-leading balance sheet even as we look for opportunities to create value.","In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Pat Kane.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Thank you, Dave. Jennifer, we're ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, gentlemen. Dave, just on that last part that you mentioned on the M&A, your thoughts, and I would agree on the strong, obviously, position you have in that deep Utica. Are you and Steve thinking more bolt-on in that area? Are there some big packages you see? Anything else you could add about what you're kind of looking at in regard to M&A in that area?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve has been closer to that. I will let him answer that question.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive Vice President and President of Exploration & Production","Sure. Neal, we're \u2013 our primary focus in terms of looking at acquisitions is really focused on a pretty narrow core area. And we'll be updating our Investor Presentation later today, and you'll see a map that shows kind of the area most of interest to us where we'll be focusing our development program as well as any M&A activity that we'd be interested in.","So, right now, it seems like there's \u2013 people are interested in selling assets. So far, the prices have still been a bit high. But as Dave said, we plan on being patient waiting for what we would consider fair prices before we transact.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. And then the 10 to 15 wells you mentioned, Steve, in the deep Utica, your thoughts how far north \u2013 I mean, you've got obviously some interesting acreage all the way up in the Allegheny and given how successful CNX is, obviously, their Gott well was all the way clear up into Westmoreland. Just your thoughts on \u2013 any ideas you can give us on those 10 wells to 15 wells? Will most of those be focused down around that Greene County area, or would you take them all the way up to potentially as north as Allegheny?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive Vice President and President of Exploration & Production","Well, we haven't spotted all of those 10 wells to 15 wells. So, it will depend on the results we see. But I would say, certainly into Southern Allegheny County where we have a pretty significant position and high expectations for the Utica, maybe up into the Northern Allegheny but more likely, it would be for us Southwestern Armstrong where we have an acreage position. I think our view would probably be we'll let others define that area. Part of the reason would be more limited takeaway capacity up there, so probably not going to be in a big hurry to drill some of these monster wells up there, probably more focused from Southern Allegheny down into Southern Wetzel and maybe a bit over into far western Marion County.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And then just the last question. Just on takeaway for the dry gas. Dave, at one time, Dave, you thought \u2013 I think you commented that really the only limitation might be just takeaway as far and maybe given how successful these wells and how economic these wells look. If you and Steve can talk about, is that \u2013 again, does that have limitations to how many wells you drill next year or by some point next year you'll have ample Utica takeaway?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Geez, I think these \u2013 if the early results continue to show up \u2013 if we see things consistent with those early results in future wells, I think we're probably going to be looking at takeaway limitations for a while. I mean, I think these wells can probably support volumes that the midstream wasn't really designed for and it's \u2013 I mean, we'll probably let Randy speak to this but it would- it's going to take a little while probably to figure out what the right midstream configuration is for the deep Utica. Randy, do you have any thoughts on that?","Randall L. Crawford - Senior Vice President and President of Midstream & Commercial","No. I concur. Obviously, we've been trying to stay out in front of the Marcellus and we've looked at our Ohio Valley Connector that's coming on. But I would also say, we're looking at Jupiter system and how we can leverage that and the infrastructure that we have in Equitrans. So, I think we're best positioned to move a little bit of the product. But certainly, these wells are quite exciting and so that will take a lot of additional infrastructure as we develop the play.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Now, we do think incidentally that the cost per unit is going to be considerably less than it is for the Marcellus because of the higher volumes, and frankly, the more concentrated nature of it. I mean, it's not just higher volumes. It's that you can get it from a tighter area. That's a much better answer from the perspective of unit gathering and compression costs. Actually, the compression cost, early on, is going to probably be a round number. Zero.","Randall L. Crawford - Senior Vice President and President of Midstream & Commercial","Yeah.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Again, thanks, guys. Great details.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Phillip Jungwirth from BMO.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets","Hey. Good morning. Couple of questions on Utica well costs. First, wondering if you could provide us with the AFE for the second Greene County and first Wetzel County Utica wells. And then, second, your targeted well cost imply about $2,500 per foot which I know it compares to some of the smaller peers over in Belmont and Monroe County who are quoting $1,200 to $1,500 per foot. Obviously, the Pennsylvania Utica is 13,000 feet compared to 10,000. But do you think that deeper depth at higher pressures would account for all of this difference or could there be further room to bring costs down as you progress through development?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive Vice President and President of Exploration & Production","Phil, this is Steve. I think \u2013 I guess regarding the AFEs, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but they're in the low-$17 millions per well. That cost will be dependent on the ultimate lateral length, so we have some flexibility about how long we end up drilling these. So, I wouldn't put a whole lot of weight on those numbers. But a significant decrease from the actual costs from our first well, which was around $30 million.","And the second part of your question, remind me again. Oh, the cost per foot? I think our view is that when we sit down and do a bottoms-up analysis of what we think it should cost to drill these wells once you work through all of the problems and get the non-productive time down to a minimum that that's where we come up with that $12.5 million. So, I think at current service costs, never say never but we don't see a path to being significantly less than that for these wells. And I think the $14 million gives us some room to have a few unexpected problems that maybe we wouldn't normally have on Marcellus wells, which is why we're quoting a range right now. But our hope is to get it at the bottom end of that range but very confident we'll get within the top end.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Great. Yeah. Looks like based on the EUR math that the implied F&D is already pretty comparable to what you're seeing in the Marcellus. Second question is on the last call you had mentioned how EQM is now more of an organic growth story. But with the narrowing of Marcellus development in 2016 and beyond, how would this impact future dropdowns given that most of the gathering of transmission assets held by EQT appear to be outside of the core Southwest PA and Northwest Virginia area?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive Vice President and President of Exploration & Production","Well, we're still working through what we want to do with future drops. But the comment about what's most economic for EQM is kind of independent of that. EQM is not well, as you know, into the high splits. And it's just more economical for an MLP to organically develop projects than to have to pay up as long as it can afford it as long as it's got the coverage that allows it to wear that period of time when that got assets tied up in projects that aren't generating cash flow.","So, we'll have to work through what happens with the remaining projects, et cetera, as we go through 2016. But my comments in the past about organic growth being the preference is just because of the way it works when you've got all of that incremental cash flow going to the GP.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets","Right. And then, historically EQT has always pre-funded the following year's cash flow outspend with asset sales or dropdown. Would this also be the intention in 2016 or do you consider the $1.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet as having already accomplished that given, I think you mentioned that you held cash as of year-end 2016?","A \u2013 [009Z0W-E Steve Schlotterbeck]>: I basically said we've already accomplished that.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and we'll go next to Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I just wanted to touch a little bit on the backlog, kind of get your updated thoughts around how that progresses over time, if that materially year-on-year continued to grow sequentially? And just trying to think through kind of what the strategy is there when you think that this ever would ultimately be drawn down and how's that contemplated in the 2016 plan?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive Vice President and President of Exploration & Production","Yeah, Michael. This is Steve. Yeah. The backlog in terms of frac stages complete but not online grew a bit this quarter, as you saw. Our expectation is that the fourth quarter will be a pretty big quarter for new TILs. Most of those will be in the back half of the quarter, so it won't affect volumes in the quarter very much but should be coming on late. So, I think you will see a fairly significant drop back to more historic levels when we \u2013 on the next call when we're talking about Q4.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And so, is there is any thought process of continuing to draw that down even further in 2016 or is that moving in following quarters kind of do you think that could to a place where you're more kind of at a run rate (29:37).","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive Vice President and President of Exploration & Production","I think that will be more the typical run rate. If you look back over our history, you go back two, three years or so, I think we've been giving these numbers you'll see it's always very lumpy. The biggest driver behind that backlog is just the timing of the rigs and the number of wells and the number of fracs per well for every pad we are on. So, it tends to be very lumpy. Right now, we haven't been taking any heroic efforts to get wells online superfast. So, that maybe drives the backlog a little bit this quarter. But again, you'll see by next quarter, we'll be back in the more of closer to the mean over the past few years.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And any indications around capital associated with that 2016 outlook?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Geez, only that it would be less than 2015. I mean, that's \u2013 but it's a fallout of this narrowing focus.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But I feel uncomfortable putting numbers out there when we're still what six weeks away from putting numbers in front of our own board. But if you're looking for directional, it would be \u2013 clearly we're heading less than 2015.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","That's helpful. Okay. And then, I guess, just wanted to \u2013 last question on my end. Think about the fourth quarter a little bit, and I think you kind of alluded to it in your comments about the back-loaded nature of the completions. But just the implications backing off the first, three quarters of the year kind of flat to down on a quarter, What are the sensitivities around that from an operational perspective, how should we think about what might put you on one end of the range or the other?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The rate for the fourth quarter...","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Right.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we just stick with what Steve said which is, we're kind of aiming towards a lot of those pads getting tilled really at the end of the quarter and therefore having very little impact on the fourth quarter volumes. And so that results in the guidance being what it is.","But we get asked a lot about our response to current prices at any one point in time. And as Steve was alluding to, in this price environment, it doesn't seem like the right time to be going through any type of heroic efforts to get things turned online any more quick.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. So the notion that we've reflected in the guidance that those TILs are going to drift backwards is just not troublesome.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...because they still get TILs.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Right.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's just the question is whether it affects December volumes or January volumes is really the issue.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Fair enough. And in the past you guys \u2013 just kind of brought up another question I had. In the past you guys talked about a pretty substantial kind of spud to turn to sales time of, I'll call it, I think nine months or so, and therefore 2015 spending is really kind of baking in the 2016 growth rate. Given that, I mean, is that still in place, which I imagine is? Is there really a price at which in 2016 you would be able to really slowdown the production? Or how do you tactically respond to gas prices in 2016 if they continue to kind of remain at these low levels on a realized basis?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll look at that as 2016 plays out. Obviously, part of the consideration, as you mentioned, is what the prices are. But really, the midstream is a big part of the consideration too. If you have some midstream flexibility, you can slowdown and kind of make it up later if you want to. And when the midstream is more full then you have to decide, you either want it or you don't. You want the volumes or you don't want the volumes because you can't really make it up on the back end, right? It's quite a ways down the road before you can make up those volumes. But we certainly take prices into account while making our decisions about capital expenditures and what type of efforts to go through to try to accelerate or otherwise turning lines for wells.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, sorry, one last one. On the gas processing side, do you have any increases in commitments around volumes from gas processing contracts that we ought to be keeping in minds, given how low NGL prices are?","Philip P. Conti - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Michael, there's a little bit more coming on in January of less than 5% of where we are.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Stephen Richardson from Evercore ISI.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning.","Philip P. Conti - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","David, as you think about the strategy and kind of just went through some of these thoughts with the board. So, is there any evolution in your thoughts in terms of what the right mix of upstream versus midstream capital is here in terms and I'd appreciate that EQM is funded to some extent organically. But in terms of returns and how to optimize that beyond 2017 just considering the gas outlook versus the gathering outlook from what you see from the different horizons here?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, just kind of to reiterate, my belief is, the further out in the future you look, the clear \u2013 and you mentioned beyond 2017 the clearer it is in my mind that capital expenditures for midstream should be at the EQM level.","We want to protect that IDR and the way to do that is to have the most attractive midstream projects possible so that they can afford to pay the incremental cash flow to the GP, which is kind of the core value of that IDR where we stand now. So, that's going to be the mindset. Strategically it's going to be midstream expenditures should occur at EQM.","Now, if you're trying to get at what's more valuable, generally, midstream or upstream, I guess, that's a bigger picture question than just one company and we'll see. We're trying to position ourselves so that we can be agnostic so that we can take advantage of wherever the value is in the value chain. I agree that with the prospects of the Utica and issues like that it's not clear what the value chain will look like several years down the road but we think that the reason EQT is such an attractive investment is because EQT will participate no matter where the most value shows up in that value chain.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Right. And can you just remind us, as you think about upstream like the right capital allocation at EQT Production for next year appreciating this 9 months or 12 months gap between when you deploy capital and when it shows up in production? Like what is the \u2013 is it a wellhead hurdle rate, is it a corporate return, is it a burden return? What's the right return on capital?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we look at all-in return. All-in after-tax returns is the way we tend to look at things. But that overlay that I mentioned in my prepared remarks was we just think we need to bear in mind what if the deep Utica works and what does that mean for clearing prices, et cetera, and therefore we should be particularly cautious about investing in anything but the core Marcellus which does stand up still in those environments and in the core Utica. So, it's more of that. There's always uncertainty about what prices are going to be. But whenever you have a new low-cost supply source in any commodity business, you've got to start being wearier of where one wants to invest one's money. So, I think there's a certain amount of caution that we're taking that we're talking about because of that unknown because of not knowing yet the extent to which the deep Utica will work.","But our feeling that if it works the way it's looking like it might that the core areas for Marcellus and Utica are simply going to be narrower. I mean, we're going to be able to supply a big portion of North America's natural gas needs from a relatively small geography.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Right. And \u2013 sorry, just final question from me is, have you and maybe it's for Randy in terms of conversations or thoughts on what the third-party opportunity is at this horizon? So again, we're all assuming that if this is economic and it is lower cost and it isn't just a zero-sum game in terms of different capital going to the Utica but is EQM particularly well-positioned to capture a larger proportion of potential third-party volumes in these areas than you have in the Marcellus? Is this a big piece of forward growth beyond the $3 billion CapEx number?","Randall L. Crawford - Senior Vice President and President of Midstream & Commercial","This is Randy. Yeah, I think we have a significant opportunity with the well results that we're seeing. In fact, I think Dave and Steve both mentioned that the core of the core Utica actually appears to sit right on top of our EQM assets, both at Equitrans and with the gathering assets along Jupiter and Northern West Virginia. In our projects that we have embarked on currently, which is the Ohio Valley Connector and our Mountain Valley Pipeline I think position us quite well to both move \u2013 to be competitive and move gas to both affiliate as well as third parties. So, I think we're very competitively well positioned.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive Vice President and President of Exploration & Production","Yeah. And, look, to your point, probably we weren't as well positioned as you move a little bit outside of the core Marcellus from a midstream perspective. So, this emergence of the Utica is from a competitive and a comparative perspective a positive for EQM.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Could you speak to the 2016 program could change if we have a warm winter and gas prices are well below the Strip (40:20) I'm thinking something around $2.25 for 2016. I'm particularly interested whether that would significantly reduce your appetite to delineate the Utica in 2016? I guess, and conversely, if prices are higher, would that change that Utica program at all?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","At that point though you are just talking about what 2016 prices would be? I mean, the norm in commodities, and I understand there does tend to be in the investor community short-term focus. I recognize that people need to make money each quarter. But actually, lower prices near term tend to lead to more robust recoveries later.","So, our view is much more the low-cost opportunities are going to be the ones that went out and you want to make sure that you're \u2013 especially if you think prices are going to be stressed at all that you're focusing on only going after the lowest cost opportunities and not letting yourself kind of get drawn into investing in opportunities that are other than that. So, I'd say that's our focus anyway. And, look, in a lower price environment because we're talking about the deep Utica perhaps helping to create that obviously becomes even more important.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. So, I guess, Dave, it sounds it's not \u2013 probably not much change.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, change -yeah, but the thing is we're not telling you what our 2016 plan is yet because we haven't gotten it approved from our board.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, it's \u2013 I'm not even sure how I go about telling you what the change would be versus the plan that we can't even discuss with you.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Fair enough, Dave. And then....","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But yeah, well if prices are lower then we'd probably over time will spend less money and if they're higher we'll probably spend more money over time. But we're already talking about 2016 being below \u2013 fair a bit below 2015 as it is.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Right. I was thinking, Dave, you mentioned maybe, 10 wells or 15 wells at the Utica in 2016 that's really what I was thinking about (42:18) program.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that'll be governed by how attractive it looks because those will still be more economical wells than anything else get probably that could get drilled anywhere in the country. So...","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe you were speaking to probably wanting to build out another gathering system for the Utica. Does that delay how quickly you want to move into development mode there? I guess thinking let's fast forward and say, you're very happy with the results or maybe even more pleased than what you're seeing today? Would you still need to put a gathering system in place before you could accelerate in 2017?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're...","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Or it's too early even to think about that?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, no, it's not too early to think about it but we haven't actually settled on what that approach will be. Our bias is that a fair bid of the gathering for Utica is probably going to be separate because of the pressures involved.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But as far as the specifics and exactly where it is and exactly how much money gets spent that we haven't. We're not ready to disclose that stuff. We're only just in the midst of even discussing that internally with our own board.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I guess and maybe another way to ask would be would you be interested potentially to have lower activity levels so you're not putting those very high pressures into your Marcellus gathering system?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're not going to put it into our Marcellus gathering system and that's \u2013 well, go ahead, Steve.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive Vice President and President of Exploration & Production","Actually, in the short-term, Drew, we can put it into the Marcellus system. It's not the most optimum situation long term for the Utica because the gathering \u2013 the unit gathering cost for the Utica in a dedicated system will be significantly lower than the cost of moving through a Marcellus system. But for the next couple of years until we figure out exactly what the optimum systems are and get them built, we can, and the likely impact, if we were doing that because the Utica was looking so good would probably be a shift from Marcellus investments to Utica which is how \u2013 which is where the capacity in those systems would effectively come from. We've replaced Marcellus gas with Utica. And as we build Utica systems, at that point, we would start to get the benefits of the lower unit cost.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. That's really helpful color. Your answers were great, I wasn't try to talk too bad or anything. Thanks a lot, guys.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I'll turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Philip P. Conti - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jennifer.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kyle Derham. Please go ahead, sir.","Kyle Derham","Good morning and thank you for joining today's conference call. With me today are John McCartney, Chairman of EQT; Toby Rice, President and Chief Executive Officer; Derek Rice, member of our Evolution Committee; Jimmi Sue Smith, Chief Financial Officer; Blue Jenkins, Executive Vice President, Commercial, Business Development and Safety; and Gary Gould, Chief Operating Officer.","The replay for today's call will be available for a 7-day period beginning this evening. The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415, with a confirmation code of 13685070. The replay will be available for seven days on our website. In a moment, John, Toby, Jimmi Sue and I will present our prepared remarks. Following these remarks, we will take your questions. EQT published a new investor presentation this morning, and we will refer to certain slides during our prepared remarks.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. Actual result and future events may differ possibly materially from those forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in today's press release and under Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as updated by our subsequent Form 10-Qs, which will also be on file with the SEC and available on our website. Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John McCartney","Thank you, Kyle, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of the Board, I'd like to thank shareholders for entrusting us with the task of overseeing EQT's transformation into a world-class energy company. The shareholder vote was an overwhelming vote of confidence for the new direction of EQT. And I'm honored to serve as Chairman of what I believe is one of the most capable, diverse and dedicated set of directors in the energy space.","With more than 80% of the votes supporting the Rice team nominees, shareholders have clearly expressed their desire for EQT to become a leading edge, data-driven, transparent and socially responsible energy company. Toby's transformation plan offers significant value to shareholders, and the Board is united in supporting and providing accountability for its execution.","Beginning immediately following the shareholders' meeting, we've had several meetings and updates at the Board and committee levels to facilitate a smooth transition into a new era for EQT. In the near term, we will continue these efforts by collaborating with the Evolution Committee and designing a compensation plan that best aligns our stated goals of lowering well costs, improving capital efficiency, driving sustainable free cash flow per share and enhancing total shareholder return with an emphasis towards absolute return.","Finally, once we've made meaningful progress on the 100-Day Plan, we intend to engage with shareholders on a more proactive basis to enhance open communications, accountability and transparency at the Board level.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Toby Rice, the newly appointed President and CEO.","Toby Rice","Thanks, John, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I am humbled to have this opportunity to lead and transform EQT into a modern, digitally enabled E&P company that will create significant value for shareholders. Being the largest gas producer in the U.S. comes with an inherent responsibility to do what's best for our employees and contractors, our landowners, our shareholders and the environment, without compromise. I expect the turnaround that we are executing will lift the company to new heights as it relates to our overall corporate citizenship.","Before I continue, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank our employees. EQT has undergone a lot of change in recent years, but I am impressed with our employees' enthusiasm and dedication to the company. Their openness to our new plan is encouraging and their participation will be one of the most important factors in our near and long-term success.","Getting back to my remarks. My team and I got to work immediately following the annual meeting and have made great progress in assessing the business. We've had some quick wins along the way, but I want to focus my remarks on sharing my vision for EQT. Let's first start with a snapshot of where EQT is today. EQT is the largest gas producer in the U.S., with 660,000 core acres in Southwestern PA and Northern West Virginia and 64,000 core acres in Southeastern Ohio. We believe EQT has the deepest inventory of economic locations in the basin and with the right leadership and approach, we can deliver superior shareholder returns in any commodity price environment. Unfortunately, EQT has not yet realized the potential of its asset base. Throughout the proxy contest, we communicated to our fellow shareholders that we believe EQT's legacy performance was the result of poor project planning due to underutilized technology and a disconnected organization. In our first 72 hours on the job, we were able to confirm our diagnosis was accurate. The employees are working tirelessly to improve current operations, but the organization has limited visibility on future development projects.","Planning in Appalachia is extremely difficult and perhaps more difficult than anywhere else in the lower 48. Our plan is specifically designed to leverage technology to connect the entire organization to improve development planning. A well-designed development schedule planned 36 months in the future is the key to consistent operational execution that will drive lower well costs and more free cash flow.","Before I talk to the details of our plan, let's look at an example that shows the importance of planning. Please turn to Slide 5 of the presentation we posted this morning.","What we are looking at here are two sets of pads developed by EQT in 2019. The pads on the left represent a poorly planned development run and on the right, a well-thought-out development run. The example gives us the opportunity to isolate the impacts of planning on efficiency and costs, since the same drilling team developed both projects in the same service cost environment. The development run on the left is clearly not an efficient set up. The new wells were squeezed onto pads with multiple existing producing wells. Our drilling team was forced to use complex well geometries to avoid wellbore collisions. The fractured rock down hole caused mud losses while drilling. And the poorly planned wellhead layouts required time-consuming rig maneuvers between wells. These factors led to inefficient and costly operations.","Adding the fact that these wells had an average lateral length of less than 8,000 feet, and the result was a drilling cost of $325 per foot, which is 80% higher than our targeted cost. Further, because these new wells were offsetting producing wells, approximately 30 million cubic feet of gas per day had to be shut-in for an extended period of time, which contributed to EQT's legacy curtailment issue. And finally, because of parent-child relationships, these newly drilled wells are expected to underperform our type curve by 10% to 15% once they are brought online. We just hit on many of EQT's legacy issues: elevated costs, curtailments of wells that underperform type curves, all explained by a poorly designed development project. So what happens when this team is given a properly designed developed development projects?","On the right side of the page, we're looking at 12 wells developed simultaneously from 2 adjacent pads. This development was initially designed by Rice Energy back in 2017 as part of what we call combo development. This project is currently being drilled by EQT today by the same team that executed the development run on the left.","Through the first 6 wells, EQT has drilled at a rate of 1,500 feet per day, a 50% improvement versus the previous pad. Drilling costs are trending to around $200 per foot, a 40% reduction in costs versus our prior example. I'll pause here to make this clear. When EQT's operational teams are given properly designed development projects, they are nearly at our targeted well cost goals, which for drilling are $190 per foot. With some additional leadership, improved engineering practices and the right pad layout, these cost goals are well within reach. Rounding out this development run, because we planned these wells so far in advance, curtailment issues are minimized and we expect all 12 wells to perform at or above type curve once turned online.","This example is focused on drilling, but we are seeing the same thing on completions. When our completion teams are given poor projects at the last minute, their efficiencies are half of what they are on properly planned projects. You may ask, \"Why would EQT develop the pad on the left?\" The answer is simple. EQT did not have a better location to send the rig and the teams were given orders and incentivized to hit production targets. Unfortunately, less than 50% of EQT's future schedule is currently setup for efficient development, as illustrated on the right. This is why we are here.","Our jobs as leaders of this organization is to align the workforce to march towards these large-scale development projects so our operational teams can execute. Our vision in path to well costs of $735 per foot ends when 80% of our development looks like what you see on the right. This is what we're simply calling the end state.","The end state is where all planning tasks are completed at least 12 months before spud, giving our execution teams the opportunity to succeed every time they step onto a pad to drill and complete a standardized well design with the lowest possible cost, on budget, on schedule and for maximum value. To give you a sense of how achievable this is, by the end of our time at Rice Energy, we had definitive and detailed development planning 3 to 5 years into the future.","Combo development represented more than 80% of our planned activity. That type of visibility becomes very powerful for decision-making, particularly around capital allocation. Planning further out in time also provides for better oilfield service contracts, lower well costs, greater leverage for commercial arrangements, ample freshwater pipe to the site for completion operations and sufficient midstream and downstream capacity for new production. This is how we get well costs to $735 per foot and hit type curve for each and every pad.","I realize this sounds simple, it is not. That said, it is our job as leaders of this company to take complicated tasks, such as master planning, and simplify them for our employees to execute. Our first step towards the end state was the creation of our Evolution Committee. This committee is comprised of EQT's Executive Team as well as Danny Rice, Derek Rice and Kyle Derham. The committee will serve as the primary liaison to the Board with respect to the execution of the 100-Day Plan. Under the oversight of the Evolution Committee, we are going to transform EQT to our planned end state in 3 key areas. First, we're going to restructure the organization to be function-based. Employees will have clear roles and priorities that facilitate efficient project planning and execution. Over the last 130 years, EQT's org structure has morphed into more than 50 departments that has led to a lack of accountability. We'll reorganize the business into 16 departments with roles that better match the life cycle of a well.","Second, we're going to bring new technology to this organization to foster the level of inter-departmental collaboration and real-time decision-making that the end state requires. The company currently operates in a very siloed manner. Data and workflows are trapped in e-mails and each department is acting on predetermined department goals, even when the goals of the organization may demand adjustments. The solution here is to implement a digital work environment that has been customized to run an Appalachian E&P business. This platform, which we used at Rice Energy with great success, will break down silos and bring transparencies to data and workflows to enable more value-driven decisions.","Third, we have high-graded leadership where needed to execute our vision. I'm happy to report that we have hired all 8 Evolution leaders mentioned during the campaign. On the operational side, we've added a VP of Operational Planning to oversee proper planning and coordination of future development; a VP of Asset Performance to oversee management of the optimal well design for each of our operating areas; a VP of Drilling and a VP of Completions to ensure well designs are consistently executed. On the technology side, we've added a Chief Information Officer and a VP of Digital Technology to oversee the buildout of our key digital solutions and change the way we work. On the organizational side, we've added a Chief Human Resources Officer to create a world-class culture and a Director of Evolution to ensure the transformation remains in compliance with established audit, governance and risk controls. These 8 leaders previously worked together in the same end state at Rice Energy and are currently marching on the 100-Day Plan we outlined.","And finally, we'll achieve the end state by properly aligning, valuing and supporting our people. EQT's employees are motivated and hard-working, but they have not been allowed to reach their full potential. In addition to the benefits of the operational, technological and organizational changes I discussed earlier, we are to challenge our employees with proper goals, recognize them in real-time and align them through incentives. This will allow them to see how they contribute to the company's mission: achieving the end state and making EQT a better business for all of its stakeholders. I'm committed to making EQT the best place to work in Pittsburgh, and these steps will get us there.","Stepping back, how long will it take before EQT is executing at well costs of $735 a foot? As we laid out in Slide 10, we expect a gradual improvement of well costs as best practices are implemented and efficient development -- inefficient development is removed from the schedule. Master planning takes time, but we expect our schedule to be predominantly combo development-run by mid-2020, which will lead to a step change in well costs to $735 per foot around that time.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jimmi Sue to share our second quarter results.","Jimmi Sue Smith","Thanks, Toby, and good morning, everyone. This morning, EQT reported second quarter 2019 net income of $126 million or $0.49 per share and adjusted net income from continuing operations of $22 million or $0.09 per share, compared to $34 million or $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2018. For the quarter, we achieved 370 Bcfe of sales volume, in line with expectations and at the high end of our guidance range of 355 to 375 Bcfe. Excluding sales volumes related to the 2018 divestitures, sales volumes of natural gas, oil and NGLs increased 8% over prior year.","Second quarter 2019 adjusted operating revenues were approximately $958 million, down 6% compared to the prior year as a result of weaker pricing, partly offset by the higher sales volumes. Average realized sales price for the quarter was $2.59 per Mcfe, $0.22 below the average price in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease in average realized price was primarily due to a decrease in higher-priced liquid sales and Btu uplift as a result of the 2018 divestitures and lower NYMEX net of cash settled derivative.","Total operating revenues for the quarter were approximately $1.3 billion, up roughly $360 million, as the second quarter of 2019 included $408 million of gains on derivatives not designated as hedges, compared to a $54 million loss last year. This reflects the increase in the fair market value of our NYMEX swap and options due to declines in forward prices during the quarter.","Now moving on to operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses were down approximately 5% as $118 million impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2018 and lower production expenses in 2019 as a result of the 2018 divestitures more than offset increases in SG&A, proxy cost and lease impairments in the period. The increase in SG&A was a result of royalty and litigation reserves of $38 million recorded during the quarter. The lease impairments primarily relate to acreage exploration, mostly outside of our current development plan.","At the unit cost level, second quarter 2019 total cash unit costs were $0.02 higher than the second quarter of 2018. Of note, EQT's transmission costs per unit was $0.54 per Mcfe, which was $0.02 higher than the second quarter of 2018 and $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range. This increase was primarily due to higher unreleased Tennessee Gas Pipeline capacity. As a reminder, we have unused capacity on this pipeline in Northern Pennsylvania. We typically either release this capacity to others or, depending on market conditions, purchase gas to sell off the pipeline.","When released, the cost of this capacity is netted against the released revenue in net marketing services. When we move gas from the pipeline, our gas or third-party gas, the cost is reported in transmission expense. We have increased our guidance range for transmission costs for the year to reflect our current expectation for the use of this capacity in 2019.","As noted above, SG&A was impacted by royalty and litigation reserves this quarter. Adjusting for these items, SG&A was $0.13 per Mcfe, which is within our annual guidance range.","Now moving to cash flow items. Second quarter adjusted operating cash flow was $386 million, compared to $529 million in 2018. As noted in our press release, second quarter adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow included the impact of approximately $38 million of royalty and litigation reserve and $22 million of proxy, transaction and reorganization-related expenses. Excluding these 2 items, operating cash flow would have been $445 million and adjusted free cash flow would have been a negative $21 million, which is slightly better than the favorable end of the range that we provided in June.","Our second quarter capital expenditures of $466 million were better than internal expectations for the quarter, primarily due to continued efficiency gain.","Looking forward, we are guiding to third quarter volume of 365 to 385 Bcfe at an average differential of negative $0.55 to negative $0.35, and we reiterate our full year capital expenditure guidance of $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. From a timing perspective, we expect 3Q CapEx to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter.","With respect to free cash flow, we have updated our annual guidance for the strip price as of June 30. At these prices, we anticipate adjusted free cash flow of $25 million to $125 million for the year, with negative cash flow in the third quarter being offset by a positive cash flow in the fourth quarter.","Lastly, I will briefly discuss our cash flow and liquidity position. On May 31, EQT entered into a $1 billion term loan agreement and used the proceeds to repay $700 million in senior notes that matured on June 1 and to repay outstanding credit facility borrowing. We ended the quarter with no funds drawn on our $2.5 billion revolver and approximately $30 million in cash. This leaves our net debt at approximately $4.97 billion. At this level, our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA leverage is at 2.1x. When reduced for the value of our investment in Equitrans Midstream using quarter end pricing, it's 1.7x.","With that, I will pass the call to Kyle.","Kyle Derham","Thanks, Jimmi Sue. I've had a chance to get to know many of our investors over the last few months. I'm currently a member of the Evolution Committee. And I'm working alongside the team to execute certain finance, Corporate Development and Investor Relations initiatives as well as helping form our general capital and allocation strategy. To help set expectations, I would like to lay out our guidance plan for the next few months.","Jimmi Sue walked through some of the changes to 2019 guidance, but we are suspending our outlook in 2020 and beyond as we develop our revised plan. We expect to come back to The Street with longer-term guidance in the next 60 to 90 days, but I will spend a few minutes providing some directional color on where we expect things to shake out.","We will be taking a different approach to capital allocation to many of our peers. In today's commodity price environment, there's a high bar to allocate capital to the drill bit, especially given the opportunity to improve our leverage profile and buy back stock at 10-year lows. We believe EQT trades at a significant discount to its intrinsic value, and while we recognize many E&Ps share this strip today, net asset value will always be an anchor for us to make the right capital allocation decisions. Fortunately for shareholders, EQT also has the potential to generate substantial near-term free cash flow per share even at current strip pricing, and that will be our focus going forward.","As Toby mentioned in his comments, EQT's legacy capital and efficiency was a function of poor development planning. Our near-term strategy will be to remove high-cost development from the schedule and focus our land, permitting and planning teams to transform that development into a combo development run that we can drill in 12 to 24 months.","This disciplined approach to development has several benefits. First, the capital efficiency of our program improves because we are only deploying development dollars when we know we can execute highly economic projects. Second, we generate more near-term free cash flow that can be used to repay debt and buy back stock. Third, we put less near-term supply on a soft gas market. And lastly, we give our midstream service provider a chance to catch its breath and provide water and gathering services at the lowest cost possible, greatly improving their capital efficiency and free cash flow.","The ultimate level of our development capital spend will be determined by the number of economic projects we have to drill measured against the opportunity to buy back shares and achieve our leverage targets. Production growth, if any, will be an output of that decision, not a target. We will be driven by growing free cash flow per share, which we believe is the key to driving shareholder value.","In making these near-term decisions, we have maximum flexibility as all of EQT's rig contracts roll off by the end of the year and we have minimal long-term commitments to other services. We will use that flexibility to design the most efficient program possible with services procured in the soft service cost environment.","Stepping back. Over the last 3 months, the forward gas strip has weakened, bringing significant pressure to the balance sheet to both public and private gas-levered E&Ps. There are approximately 75 rigs running in Appalachia today and 50 in the Haynesville. We believe the vast majority of these rigs are subeconomic at strip pricing. The equity in gas markets are sending a clear message to operators to cut growth to maintenance levels and someone need to go further than that.","While we have started to see a pullback in activity, more is needed to balance the market. We believe the marginal cost of supply is well above strip and the market will work itself out over the long term. That said, all of our efforts are geared towards transforming EQT into the lowest-cost operator in the basin to weather what could be a challenging 2020 and position the business for long-term success when prices normalize.","Turning to the balance sheet. In general, our policy will be to target forward leverage of less than 2x net debt-to-EBITDA at the lower of strip gas prices or $2.50. Free cash flow and any potential divestiture proceeds will be used to achieve this leverage profile and any additional cash flow will largely be returned to shareholders via stock buybacks. We are committed to the investment-grade rating and believe access to low-cost financing will be a strategic advantage over the next several years. We believe this policy will allow us to maintain investment-grade metrics. And we look forward to engaging with the agencies over the coming months after we have finalized our long-term development plan.","One lever we can pull to manage debt is our retained interest in Equitrans, which is worth approximately $900 million as of today. While we are evaluating a divestiture, it is not part of our immediate plans. Any potential exit will be done responsibly, and we have several options at our disposal. For now, we are benefiting from the 10% dividend yield and see several positive catalysts for Equitrans as we transform EQT.","First, while there may be a reduction in our volume forecasts in the near to medium term, we expect that our ability to hand Equitrans a fully baked schedule that plans combo development 12 to 36 months in advance will greatly reduce their capital needs and boost free cash flow. We saw this happen in 2017 at Rice Midstream Partners following Rice Energy's upstream transformation, and we expect it to happen for Equitrans as early as 2020.","Second, we are working together to simplify our services contracts. While we all recognize the gathering fees are on the high end of the market, our strategy allows for other levers to be pulled that will be a win-win for both parties, including increasing utilization of freshwater systems and the construction of produced water disposal systems. These opportunities should lower our overall cost mix, while providing incremental revenue sources for Equitrans. We have already engaged with Equitrans management, and both sides are thrilled to start working together to develop this world-class resource and deliver gas to market at the lowest cost possible.","Regarding asset sales, we're in the process of reviewing all of EQT's assets and remain open to divesting acreage or production as it fits within our capital allocation framework of maximizing free cash flow per share and NAV. To summarize, we are taking a differentiated approach to capital allocation. We are in the process of rationalizing EQT's development schedule and we will come back to The Street with a revised long-term outlook that reflects the potential of this world-class asset while also respecting the current commodity price environment.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Holly Stewart of Scotia, Howard and Weil.","Holly Stewart","Maybe just first to John, a few of the midstream things. And Kyle, I think you hit on certainly a couple of them. Seems to be some sentiment out there in the marketplace today around your commitment to MVPs. I was just hoping maybe you could sort of clear the waters a little bit there.","Donald Jenkins","Holly, this is Blue. I'll take that one. So a couple of things on MVP. One, we're confident that it will get built and we are utilizing the most recent -- most likely scenario used by E-Train, which is mid-2020. In terms of the conversation of can we walk away, would we get out, there isn't a reasonable scenario in which we would walk away from that project without a massive [indiscernible] and so that's just not how we look at it. That's just not a reasonable outcome.","Holly Stewart","Okay. That's it. That was what we thought, but just wanted to clear that out. Kyle, you mentioned thoughts around the E-Train shares. Maybe you could just provide a little bit of color. I know there's some timing issues with that equity being public and the files that have to be -- forms that have to be filed if you decided to divest that for a year. So can you just maybe provide a little bit of color on that process?","Kyle Derham","Yes. No. We're really focused on the business for now. I think, clearly, that's a divestiture candidate for us over the longer term, but it's not part of the immediate plan. We're not going to guide to any timing expectations around when that might happen.","Holly Stewart","Okay. That's great. And then maybe just one last one for me. It looked like Moody's recently moved you down to -- your outlook down from stable to negative. Can we just talk? There seems to be several maturities coming up in the next few years. Toby, just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on how those maturities are addressed and sort of general outlook on the leverage profile.","Kyle Derham","Sure. Yes. This is Kyle. I'll take that one. Yes. The leverage targets, again, going to be below 2x. And when we say that, we include our gas price assumption for that which to us is the lower of strip in $2.50, and I think that positions us very well from an investment-grade rating metrics perspective. In terms of the maturities, certainly, they're on our radar. It's not something we're ignoring right now, but want to sort of improve the cost structure of the business before assessing that, but it's certainly on our radar.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","In your opening remarks, you mentioned that you see the benefits of your plan maximized when you're planning 36 months in the future, I think you said when you complete the planning 12 months ahead of spud. In Slide 10, your expectation seems that you will see the greatest step change in value creation over the course of the second half of 2020. Can you just add more color for what drives that step change in 2020 and then how lower commodity prices and lower activity could, if at all, impact the scale you're trying to achieve?","Toby Rice","So Brian, this is Toby. To -- when looking at our $735 per foot cost target, I think it's important to understand there's really 4 main drivers behind us achieving that level. The first being operational efficiency that we're able to achieve in the field, how fast can we drill, how many stages per day can we complete. I feel very confident after looking at the teams that we're going be able to achieve the operational efficiencies needed to hit that $735 a foot. The second thing we look at is the procurement and the oilfield. So we have flexibility with our oilfield service contracts in place right now. So we have -- we feel pretty good about our ability to acquire the right services at the right costs to achieve our cost targets. The third is -- comes to well design, and we are deploying our proven well design. We feel really confident in the cost to execute and the type curve that we will receive. And then the fourth thing we look at is our schedule. And this is really where we're going to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting and is to get a schedule that allows for combo development, starting with multiple wells per pad, meeting a minimum horizontal well length. And that's really where the focus is going to be. I'd say the benefits that you're going to get when you get the combo development are going to be largely driven on the logistics front and also on bulk materials procurement.","Kyle Derham","Yes. And just to jump in, Brian. I think, with respect to timing, the biggest impediment to setting up combo development right is on the land and permitting side, and so that's where we'll be focusing our resources. And those realistically take about 12 months to set up, and so that's why you see that step change in well cost on that graphic on Slide 10. And so once those are set up and they start hitting the schedule, you'll really see the benefits and start to see $735 a foot.","Brian Singer","Got it. And do the benefits change if you're running at a lower activity level in response to the lower commodity prices or you think the same per foot assets can be achieved kind of regardless of activity?","Kyle Derham","Yes. We think we're going to be operating at a level of activity that allows us to achieve economies of scale necessary to reach the $735 a foot.","Brian Singer","Great. And then just one follow-up on the midstream discussion. Earlier, you highlighted within existing contracts some opportunities that could potentially come up where you can restructure and add new business. Can you just give us just a little bit more of a sense of what that could mean, either from a cost perspective or free cash flow perspective?","Kyle Derham","Yes. Sure. This is Kyle. I don't want to give any specific guidance with respect to rate reductions or anything like that. But the new business for Equitrans that could be is expanding the utilization of the freshwater systems. They're actually largely built by Rice Midstream Partners a few years ago. And then, obviously, the water disposal options, getting trucks off the road, allowing Equitrans to build a system to move water, those are the incremental revenue sources that we think would offset any potential rate reduction on the midstream gathering side.","Operator","The next question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","The Rice team had identified call it $500 million of free cash flow uplift relative to EQT's prior plan when implemented. I was wondering if you could maybe help us walk through the $500 million that you previously cited between the DMC cost savings and other initiatives. Just trying to better understand how you get to that number.","Toby Rice","Yes. Sure. So the $500 million we talked about in the campaign was a couple of things that were driving us getting to $500 million. First, being assumed activity level, and that activity level would assume that we were growing at 5%. And the second being the cost difference between executing well costs at $1,100 a foot or compared to a $735 per foot target. So some things have changed, obviously. We are setting expectations and coming up with an amount of activity that is based on economic projects to develop. So what we're really focused on and want to be comparing ourselves against going forward in the future is going to be how close we are to our $735 per foot cost target because that's irrespective of activity levels.","Arun Jayaram","Fair enough. And just a follow-up, you guys expressed a strong commitment to the MVP pipeline. But just better kind of understand is -- if the project is delayed, call it, passed mid next year, is there any recourse for EQT in terms of the tolling agreements or the fees on that to -- just given that the project is beyond its original time line?","Donald Jenkins","Yes. So this is Blue, Arun. So the short answer is, no. What we have is a contract that caps our rate based on time and based on cost, and that's where we sit. So if it happens to slide, let's say, it's Q4 instead of Q2, so it wouldn't change anything. We have plans in place to manage if that should be the case and are prepared for that. But know that the contract is fairly set at this point and we still expect, as I mentioned, that it will be completed and we don't have any financial incentive to walk away from that.","Operator","The next question is from David Deckelbaum of Cowen and Company.","David Deckelbaum","It's David from Cowen. Just -- and congrats coming back into the public fold, guys. I just want to ask just -- you commented earlier, I think -- I know that the 2020 vision and beyond is suspended for the time being. You said, I think, about half of the development programs moving forward right now are not set up optimally. I note like in Slide 5 where you highlighted a sort of ideal or end game pad versus something that was recently drilled. That wasn't necessarily just not [indiscernible] was also shorter laterals or perhaps a project that wouldn't be drilled. I guess what percentage of projects that exist right now would you just not drill that are on the current schedule?","Derek Rice","Yes. David, this is Derek. So we're currently going through the schedule and assessing good projects versus bad projects. And obviously, the bad projects we would like to pull those from the schedule. I don't think it makes sense drilling $1,100 per foot type well at this gas price environment. So before pulling those off of the schedule, we're running those through the traps. Whenever you make any change to the schedule, there is a ripple effect, where do you send that rig if it's not going to the proposed site. And so I think, over the next, call it, 30 to 60 days, we'll have a better assessment of what exactly we can pull off the schedule. An ideal situation, we pull those poor development projects off the schedule, replace them with correct projects that are planned appropriately, whether or not we can do that again, that's just going to be part of the assessment. So from within the first few weeks, we've identified some inefficiencies in the program, and now we're just going to evaluate whether or not we can pull those through.","Toby Rice","Yes. And I would just make one point. I mean we've identified these projects and these are projects that can be improved and our job is to align the workforce, focus our resources to make these projects more economic, lengthen laterals, add wells per pad, see if we can make -- turn them into combos. So we're not just taking stuff off the schedule. We are focusing resources to make them end state-like.","David Deckelbaum","Sure. I mean, but given that, can you effect those changes by the first half of next year in that drilling program or is this more a second half of '20 program and you might just be willing to kind of eat lesser economics in the beginning of next year?","Toby Rice","Yes. I think we're going to have a better understanding on timing if we get a little bit more time here. I mean it's been 10 days. I think we've done a good job in identifying some of the issues, and now it's -- what's our confidence in being able to align the schedule to meet our minimum development criteria, and that's something we'll report back to you guys when we have better clarity on that in the future.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate that. I think, Kyle, I think you remarked that the most difficult impediment to the future plan is sort of around land and permitting in that it can kind of take 12 months to set that up. I guess what else needs to be done on the midstream side just in terms of facilities to be able to turn in that many wells in these locations? I know you talked about the waters opportunity that's out there. I guess, logistically, what needs to happen on the midstream side so you can execute this plan?","Toby Rice","Yes. This is Toby. There's a couple of things outside of land and permitting, yes, the long lead time items, as you identified, is gather and take away and having access to freshwater and have that be piped to locations. So I mean we're going through an analysis right now understanding the gathering systems and the capacity forecasts, combined with our schedule to make sure that everything is synced up so we don't have -- we can minimize any curtailment issues. And the same thing, with a good schedule, we understand when we're going to be fracking. We could pair that up with water needs and make sure that the midstream team can service our water needs when we need to complete. So this is the type of work. In addition to this, there's another 40 constraints that we are maneuvering into optimum schedule. And this is the work that we're doing and where we'll be looking forward to updating people when we have a more complete picture of what the development schedule will look like in the future.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","Welcome back to the public fold. Yes, I just -- I guess I wanted to talk through a couple of the slides. On Slide 5, I was just thinking as you walked through that, obviously, there's some risk maybe that the legacy activity will have kind of cannibalized the opportunity to move forward in a more -- in that kind of properly planned development case. Kind of how confident are you in the kind of ability to move forward with that properly planned case and fully achieve that end state goal? How much more work do you think remains to be done in terms of understanding the potential impacts of legacy development on the ability to optimize things going forward?","Toby Rice","This is Toby, real quick, and then I'll pass it over to Derek. I would say the thing that we're excited about is the fact that we have such a large inventory of undeveloped leasehold. If you look at where we're going to be focusing our development in Southern Greene, there's not a lot of producing wells we have to dance around so our inventory is pretty virgin. And so -- but it does take work to get that leasehold ready to develop, and that's we're going to be focusing our teams. Any other color you want to add on that, Derek?","Derek Rice","Yes. I mean just one thing. I mean just look at the asset base and this is what gets us comfortable saying we're going to get there is because the issues that we're seeing with EQT today, to be frank, this is what we dealt with at Rice Energy in 2014 and 2015 when we had the same vision. It's -- we know what end state we like to get to, what are the steps needed to get there. It's essentially the same asset base, primarily in Greene County and Washington County. A lot of the sites that we plan to develop going forward are Rice Energy sites, so we have a clear picture of what we need to do to get there and I think we've done it before and we think we can get there again.","Michael Hall","All right. Excellent. And then, I mean -- sorry, go ahead. Share more.","Toby Rice","No, that was it.","Michael Hall","Okay. Yes. In that context, I guess, I can't help but look at West Virginia and think that there's quite a bit of potential for optimizing that land position and potentially helping build out that inventory into something more ready for optimal development. What's the kind of gameplan on that, time lines and thought process as to when that will kind of compete internally, if you will?","Toby Rice","Yes. This is Toby. Yes, so we are working to develop West Virginia and make that drill-ready. And we have the resources, so we're prepared -- we're going to start preparing that right now. The gameplan is we've got a couple of years while we're focusing our development in Greene and Washington counties to get West Virginia ready. Obviously, it's a little bit more challenging in West Virginia just because terrain is a little bit more difficult, makes site selection a little bit harder and putting together a continuously sole position is something that's important and with the fracture lease position in West Virginia makes it a little bit more challenging. But I will say that the EQT team does have some trades currently going on, so we are focused on building contiguously sole position that will support combo development.","Michael Hall","Okay. Excellent. And last on my mind is just if you had any sort of estimate yet for what you would think about as a kind of a breakeven gas price in the context of driving corporate level free cash flow going forward.","Toby Rice","Yes. No. Let us get back to you and fix you in 90 days. And we'll be able to better run some sensitivity so you can kind of see free cash flow at different price stacks.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Silverstein of Wolfe Research.","Joshua Silverstein","Just following up on some of the questions before. There definitely seems to be a much bigger emphasis on free cash flow generation and -- over growth. Are you guys willing to go to maintenance mode or even decline as you're implementing the strategy into next year?","Toby Rice","Yes, Josh. This is Toby. I mean I would say that the driver of activity levels is going to be the setup on economic projects that we have to develop. So I mean that's really where it all starts when you think about, I mean, just bringing this business back to fundamentals and making investments in good projects. And the production growth targets or the production targets that we set are going to be the outcome of fundamentally sound investment decisions on the drill bit.","Joshua Silverstein","Got you. I guess, once implemented, assuming we're in a 2.50 environment, can EQT be sub-2x levered, grow 5% and generate a significant amount of free cash flow?","Toby Rice","At 2.50? Yes, I mean, Josh, I think it's realistic. But again, at 2.50 , it's not really where we're going to be growing production volumes into that type of environment, so that's not really the scenario we're talking about. But we'll get back to you after we spent some time with the development schedule to really forecast this out and give you the granularity you need.","Joshua Silverstein","Got you. Okay. I mean as the biggest gas producer out there, certainly setting tone around 2.50 would help there. And then just to understand, you talked about this massive penalty potentially for getting out of the MVP pipeline. Can you put some context around that? Is it $100 million? Is it $500 million? Like what is massive in terms of getting out of MVP?","Donald Jenkins","Yes. This is Blue. The short answer is we're not going to walk on the project. I think that's probably the short answer.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell","My first question was back -- going back to Slide 5, but just looking at something else there. It says that greater than 80% of the remaining inventory can look like the good pad that you illustrated. I was just wondering, is it reasonable to assume that some of that other less than 20% could either be sold or impaired?","Derek Rice","Yes. This is Derek. So the majority of that sort of poorly planned development that remains, it's largely within EQT's producing well footprint, so very similar to what you're seeing on the left there. Not exactly something that anybody wants to buy. The way that we look at it is that's stuff that we'd like to develop in the year 2030-plus. So as much as we can push that back, the better.","Toby Rice","Yes. I mean the development is not set up for economic development today. But I mean gas prices change, that's where that stuff can make economic sense. But we're going to be disciplined to develop that when it does make sense.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. And I guess that could also be a decision between -- I mean, because you can also sell producing reserves, but then if you sell them, then it might raise your corporate decline rate, so there might be a reason you want to keep them just to -- as part of a good base decline. I mean is that reasonable as well?","Toby Rice","Yes. That's correct.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. And I was wondering -- I thought this is really interesting in your earlier remarks. I was wondering how much time do you think is going to be required to digitize EQT along the lines of the former Rice Energy because it sounds like it's not just a software shift, but it's actually a different way of working that's enhanced by technology.","Toby Rice","Yes. I think we think about a digital transformation is sort of what we're going through. I mean it's not just bringing technology to an organization. It's bringing a cultural change as well. You think about what we're going to be doing here with technology, it's going to bring massive transparency to the business. People need to be comfortable with that type of transparency. And what's exciting about that is once we have that transparency, then we're going to start having the opportunity to start collaborating more. And when people start collaborating, then we're going to start having some more ideas and innovation is going to start bubbling up. And if we can focus that innovation on the things that matter, the bottlenecks and the opportunities within our business, then we can start generating value for shareholders, and that's evolution. And so it all starts with technology, but it's really going to change the culture here at EQT and we're excited about that opportunity going forward.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. And last question was just kind of structural, I guess, is you mentioned that the Evolution Committee is the main liaison to the Board of Directors. I was wondering how does the Evolution Committee interface with operational leaders to facilitate the changes that you've enumerated?","Toby Rice","Sure. So it's a transparent plan that we're executing. Part of our -- when we talked about transforming EQT into a modern company, what modern means to us is coming up with a good strategy and leveraging technology to execute. So the strategy in this case is our 100-Day Plan. And the technology that we're implementing is in our digital work environment, and that will be available for all the employees to see the tasks that we're doing to take us one step, to take us closer to an evolved state. We have -- the EQT executives are on this Evolution Committee. We have a feedback channel set up for employees to speak up and tell us what do they want to change, what do they want to keep the same. And these employees are speaking up, we've got over 400 responses to this survey. So we are currently assessing the feedback and implementing that into our task list that we're doing. So it's -- everybody here is going to be engaged.","Operator","The next question is from Jane Trotsenko of Stifel.","Yevgeniya Trotsenko","I have a question regarding DUCs and how they fit into the current or, let's say, future development plan. I see that there are over 200 DUCs in Marcellus and I'm just curious how do they compete versus, let's say, drilling new wells using this combo development.","Toby Rice","Jane, this is Toby. So I say -- I think the way that we wrote that is just the way that we've categorized the 209 is wells that have been drilled in some form or fashion. I think 92 of those are actually drilled to total depth, so that was -- would be what we would call a true DUC.","Yevgeniya Trotsenko","Okay. So the other way of saying is that you guys plan to compete the existing 96 DUCs, right? And I would say that we should expect 10% lower EUR just because they have been done using the old approach, right?","Toby Rice","No. It wouldn't say that we would change the production that we said we're going to receive from these wells. We've reaffirmed our production guidance for this year.","Yevgeniya Trotsenko","Okay. Okay. And then the remaining over 100 DUCs, those are just kind of top hole, I guess?","Toby Rice","Yes. That's correct.","Yevgeniya Trotsenko","Okay. Got it. And then I have a question for Jimmi Sue regarding these term loan agreement. If you guys can kind of explain the logic for entering into this agreement for $1 billion.","Jimmi Sue Smith","In the term loan agreement? So [indiscernible] clear that the proceeds from the ETRN state will be used to reduce our leverage, but that we were going to be disciplined about when we did that sale. We had a $700 million maturity coming up on our revolver. And the term loan was available at rates lower than our -- I'm sorry, the $700 million maturity was long-term borrowings we could have put it on the revolver, but the term loan was available and the interest rates on the term loan are lower than those on our current revolver.","Yevgeniya Trotsenko","Okay. Got it. The last question, if I could. Regarding the production mix going forward. Is it going to remain roughly the same in terms of Southwest Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia completions?","Kyle Derham","Yes. This is Kyle. I think it will be similar for the rest of the year, as we've outlined. I think it's possible as we get through this review that we have a little more activity focused in Washington and Greene County in Pennsylvania and a little less in West Virginia as we're putting that land position together to set it up for combo development. So it's possible, in 2020 and maybe 2021, you'll see a little more in Pennsylvania than West Virginia than in 2019.","Operator","The next question is from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker","Just wanted to follow up on a question earlier about CapEx. I think you had said -- Jimmy Sue you had said that 3Q CapEx you expect to be a bit higher than 2Q, but did I also hear you right in saying that you'd likely be settling down D&C spending in the near term?","Jimmi Sue Smith","No. I think we've reaffirmed our CapEx guidance for the year. I think what I said was if you take what we spent year-to-date, you look at the midpoint of the guidance and if you want to try to get the case of that third quarter, fourth quarter, third quarter will be higher than the fourth quarter.","Andrew Venker","Okay. And I guess just one for Toby is on the land spending, as you guys are spending more time there and on permitting. Do you think the lower land spending rate per year is still a realistic goal from the $200 million a year or so that EQT had been running at?","Toby Rice","Yes. So I mean I think the way we look at land, we've got a large asset base, and one of the things that we're going to bring to this organization is focus. And that operation schedule that we put out is going to allow our land teams to focus their resources on preparing for that operation schedule. So this is part of the -- understanding what our -- the land spend that we need is going to be something that we're focusing our assessment on right now and have better color for you in the future when we get through that assessment.","Andrew Venker","One on the midstream contracts as well. Do you expect to start negotiations to then extend this, I think, particularly gathering contracts? It sounds like you guys already had some conversations with the folks at Huron [ph].","Toby Rice","Yes. No. We're just continuing the discussions that had started earlier this year. And so, yes, we're excited about working with them and excited about handing them a fully baked development schedule to make their lives easier. So we'll keep the group updated on how things go.","Andrew Venker","Okay. One last one. Can you just tell us a bit about the Happiness campaign?","Toby Rice","Yes. The whole point here is we're -- we want to do two things. We want to create great results for shareholders and we want to create a great working environment for our employees, and I believe that those two things go together. And part of us being -- creating a great work environment for our employees is having a happy workforce. And we believe the keys behind driving happy employees is creating employees that are increasing their -- that are productive, employees that are challenged, recognized and have fun at work. Fortunately, our plan, everything that we talked about, focusing and aligning our employees on the things that matter, that fits largely into making our employees more productive. Challenging, I think we're asking employees to hit some goals that I think would be optimistic from where they're at today. But as we've shown, they have the capability of doing it, so we're going to be challenging the employees. And then the digital work environment, the transparency that's going to bring is also going to bring -- allow us as leaders and managers of this business to recognize the performance of the employees. And then the last part, having fun at work, really what we're going to be focusing on there in winning, and winning is setting goals and hitting goals and that's going to be the fun that we have is by doing those things. So that's that in a nutshell.","Operator","The next question is from Welles Fitzpatrick of SunTrust.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Thanks for all the detail and getting cost down via efficiencies in midstream. But can you talk a little bit more to how much wood there is to chop on the drilling and completion contracts? And is it fair to assume that those legacy contracts generally roll off in 2020?","Toby Rice","Yes. This is Toby. So the drilling contracts, the horizontal rigs are rolling off by the end of this year. The frackers we have are currently rolling month-to-month with our frac suppliers. So we're looking to continue relationships we have and also making sure that we're acquiring services at the cost that we need to hit our targets. We are -- after seeing that, we're -- one of the things I was pleased to see is that we have the flexibility and don't see procurement as an impediment to us reaching our $735 cost per foot goal.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Okay. Perfect. And then just one follow-up. On the G&A side, I guess it's fair to assume that it will be a little bit choppy through year-end as you bring in new people and whatnot. Do you expect that to stabilize pretty early in 2020 or even later this year?","Toby Rice","Yes. We are continuing to go through our assessments of the departments right now, but we know what we're looking for and we would expect that to be through that through '19, for sure.","Welles Fitzpatrick","Perfect. That's all I have. Congrats on getting back at it.","Toby Rice","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Sameer Panjwani of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Sameer Panjwani","First off, on CapEx. Wanted to see if it's possible to realize some of the savings in 2019 as you try to high grade the program or are we just too far along for that to be meaningful at this point?","Derek Rice","Yes. So this is Derek. So I mean, I'll be honest. In the first 2 weeks, our primary focus has been to stabilize the business. We've largely been in listen-only mode. I will say there have been a couple things we've come across that we felt as though we need to change in the near term. One thing on the completion design front, when we walked in the door, there were 30 different completion designs. We looked at all the data with the teams and we came to a conclusion that reducing that to one design, one proven design, was efficient. What that allows us to do is not only predict the performance of our wells going forward, but it also gives our completions team the ability to procure the appropriate amount of materials on a go-forward basis. On the drilling front, we briefly looked at their drilling parameters. We noticed there were some self-imposed limitations, a little bit technical, I won't go into it. We lifted those limitations and saw immediate gains in drilling performance. To put some color on that, the previous single-day 24-hour rate in the second quarter was 6,600 feet in a 24-hour period. And just last week, this drilling team surpassed 7,800 feet in a 24-hour period. So again, largely in listen-only mode the first 2 weeks, but we think that as we get more hands-on going forward, we will start seeing more efficiency gains and continued operational improvement.","Sameer Panjwani","Okay. Okay. That's good to hear. And then next, there was a question earlier about the potential to kind of move to a maintenance program next year. I know you guys haven't decided on anything yet, but would it be too early to ask you what a maintenance budget would look like next year, kind of given that transition period where you're still going to be realizing some of the savings? And how you expect a maintenance budget to look longer term once you're fully at that $735 per foot?","Toby Rice","Yes. No. Sorry to punt, but we're going have to get back to you on that after we go through our assessment.","Sameer Panjwani","Yes. Yes. No worries. And then, I guess, last question. You talked a little bit about potential non-core asset sales. Wanted to see if you had any interest in following one of your peers who just monetized some NRI. I think historically, EQT has had a fairly high NRI, so just what are your thoughts on potentially taking advantage of the valuation spread between those assets and the equity today?","Kyle Derham","Yes. This is Kyle. That's really not something we're evaluating currently.","Operator","The next question is from Betty Jiang of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Betty Jiang","Can you talk about the levers you have to reduce leverage -- leveraging the near term to get to sub-2x. If E-Train stake is not in the immediate plan, are non-core asset sales being prioritized as tools to delever? Maybe just to get some color on what you guys consider to be non-core.","Toby Rice","Yes. No, I mean like we said, everything is sort of on the table. Obviously, it's selling for just PDP PV-10 is a top way to delever. And there are a ton of buyers who want to buy non-core assets for more than that. So asset sales are difficult way to delever. I think what we're looking at is delevering organically, and we'd do that by lowering well costs and rationalizing the development plan, so that's kind of our path forward to 2x or less.","Betty Jiang","Got it. And just to clarify, what's your view on balancing between debt reduction and share buyback? Is the goal to get to 2x leverage first before you do buyback?","Toby Rice","Yes. That's correct, Betty.","Betty Jiang","Got it. Okay. And last thing, with the potentially lower volumes on less activity, do you see reduced production constraint, that was last estimate at roughly 10% of the current production?","Toby Rice","Yes. That could be a result, right? We know the prior team characterized about 10% of production base as curtailed. After assessing that, that's not really the way we're going to talk about it going forward. But, yes, any potential curtailments would be alleviated by a reduced capital spend and less production volumes.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer period. I'll turn the call back over to Toby Rice for closing remarks.","Toby Rice","Thanks, everyone, for joining us. We appreciate your support in this campaign. And we are looking forward to continuing the work we've laid out and excited about sharing our progress with you in the future. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Kane. Mr. Kane, please go ahead.","Patrick John Kane","Thanks, Dana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Dave Porges, President and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Conti, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Randy Crawford, Senior VP and President of Midstream and Commercial; and Steve Schlotterbeck, Executive Vice President and President of Exploration and Production.","This call will be replayed for a 7-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 today. The telephone number for the replay is (412) 317-0088. The confirmation code is 10037707. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website. To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, are consolidated in EQT's results. There was a separate press release issued by EQM this morning and there is a separate conference call today at 11:30 a.m., which creates a hard stop for this call at 11:25. If you are interested in the EQM call, the dial-in number for that call is (412) 317-6789.","In just a moment, Phil will summarize EQT's operational and financial results for the second quarter 2014. Then Steve will comment on the findings of our review of our dry Utica acreage and finally Dave will provide an update on our transmission projects and GP cash flow projections and evaluation included in our updated analyst presentation, which was posted on our website this morning. Following Dave's remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy and Steve will all be available to answer your questions.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2013, filed with the SEC, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and are available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti","Thanks Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings of $0.58 per diluted share, which represents a $0.02 per share increase versus the second quarter of 2013. The GAAP EPS was $0.73 per share in the quarter and included a $38 million gain on the asset exchange with Range, with $31 million of that gain realized at Production and the balance recognized at Midstream.","As Pat reminded you, EQT Midstream Partners, or EQM's results, are consolidated in EQT's results. The impact of the noncontrolling interest in those results is a little clearer on the income statement than it is on the cash flow statement. EQM operating cash flow or adjusted EBITDA as it is defined in the EQM press release was $57 million in the quarter and is included in EQT's consolidated cash flow. However, as we have noted in the past, not all of that cash flow is available to EQT, as noncontrolling unitholders owned approximately 64% of EQM at the end of the second quarter 2014.","Summarizing the quarter from an operational and financial perspective, EQT production volumes were 110 Bcf or approximately 17% higher than the second quarter last year but about 4 Bcf below our previous forecast. The shortfall versus guidance was due to the delay in the installation of a gathering pipeline, which postponed 2 multi-well pads from being turned in line, and also due to the delay in construction of well lines to another multi-well pad. In total, 22 wells were delayed and all 22 of those wells are currently flowing, which explains why we are reiterating our full year guidance of between 465 and 480 Bcf equivalent.","We expect third quarter production volumes of 118 Bcf to 122 Bcf equivalent or a 9% sequential growth rate assuming the midpoint of that range.","Midstream gathered volumes were also up in the quarter about 17% higher than last year. However, the volume growth at both businesses was largely offset by lower commodity prices and absolute costs that were higher than last year consistent with, but less than, the growth in volumes.","Prices were obviously a big factor in the quarter. At the consolidated level EQT's average effective sales price of $3.85 per Mcf equivalent was about 10% lower than the $4.29 we realized in the second quarter last year. The average NYMEX gas price for the quarter was actually considerably higher at $4.67 per MMBtu compared to $4.09 last year. However, from a hedge price perspective, a portion of the impact of that higher NYMEX was offset by the fact that some higher price swaps rolled off in 2014.","Also basis was significantly lower at negative $0.78 in the second quarter 2014 compared to basis which was basically flat with NYMEX last year. However, we were able to recover about $0.20 per Mcf equivalent in the second quarter 2014 through transporting some of our gas to higher-priced markets, and also through the resale of our unused capacity. The realized price of $3.85 included an $0.08 non-cash hedge loss on derivatives that were marked-to-market. The realized price at EQT Production was $2.92 per Mcf equivalent compared to $3.24 last year, or also about 10% lower.","EQT Midstream realized $0.93 compared to $1.05 last year, as a result of a lower gathering rate, lower average gathering rate. And finally, our third-party gathering and transmission costs were $0.54 or about $0.05 per unit lower than the second quarter last year.","A few brief comments on the production results. EQT production operating income, adjusted for the gain on the Range transaction was 8% higher than last year. As I discussed a minute ago, this 17% volume increase was significantly offset by lower commodity prices. The result was net operating revenue of about $322 million in the quarter, which was only 5% higher than the second quarter of 2013 despite the healthy volume growth.","Operating expenses were about 1% higher. Excluding the $4.8 million legal reserve, SG&A, production taxes, and LOE were all higher, as you would expect given the volume growth, however DD&A was lower as a result of a depletion rate that is 19% lower than last year, primarily as a result of the increase in reserves at year-end 2013.","Moving on to Midstream results in the quarter. Midstream operating income adjusted again for the gain on the Range transaction was up 13% due to the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity base transmission revenue. Net revenue was $152 million, up about 16%. Gathering net revenue increased by 5%, as gathering volumes increased by 17%, but were somewhat offset by an 11% decrease in the average gathering rate. That gradual decrease in average gathering rate has been ongoing and is due to the continued increase in the Marcellus gathered volumes in the mix, which are relatively less expensive to gather and therefore, gets charged at a lower rate.","Midstream transmission net revenues also increased by 33% in the quarter, driven by higher capacity reservation charges and throughput. Third-party transmission revenues were 73% higher than last year and accounted for 1\/2 of second quarter transmission revenue. Storage, marketing and other operating revenue was $4.1 million higher in the second quarter, as a result of revenue from storage assets that were received as part of a consideration from the utility sale that closed in December.","Operating expenses at Midstream were up 20% quarter-over-quarter, however, per unit gathering and compression expense was 6% lower, driven down by the volume growth.","A couple of comments on funding and liquidity in the second quarter. As you know, we sold our Jupiter gathering system to EQM for $1.2 billion in May of 2014. There was no EQT income statement impact from that transaction, as EQT controls EQM through the general partner ownership and therefore, EQM's results are consolidated with EQT. From a tax perspective, however, EQT did realize a gain on the transaction, and we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $100 million related to the sale of the Jupiter gathering system.","A quick update on our share repurchase authorization. We bought back 300,000 shares of EQT stock during the quarter and have 700,000 shares remaining under the current authorization. And then just a couple of quick notes on the balance sheet. We closed the quarter with no short-term debt other than the $330 million of short-term debt at EQM that gets consolidated into EQT's balance sheet, and a current cash balance at EQT of approximately $1.4 billion. We also continue to have full availability under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. Using the current strip for the remainder of the year, our operating cash flow estimate for full year 2014 is approximately $1.5 billion.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Thank you, Phil. As we discussed at the time of the first quarter call, we were revisiting our geologic and engineering analysis of the dry Utica\/Point Pleasant potential on our acreage. As we look at the initial results of the wells drilled so far in the play by other operators, our technical teams are very encouraged that the results are basically in line with what our models would predict. Until now, we've been hesitant to drill our own well based solely on those models, given the lack of well control. But we think it is now time to drill a test well on our acreage.","Based on our review, we have approximately 400,000 acres that could be prospective for Utica. There's little disagreement that there is a tremendous amount of gas in place in the play. The question is whether or not the gas can be profitably produced, as each well could cost as much as $15 million. Based on our work, we decided to drill the first test well in Greene County. The main reasons for this were: one, the geology under Greene County looks quite good; and two, we have existing pads, roads, and takeaway pipes in place that could be leveraged if we are successful. We realize that this well is an experiment and could result in a $15 million dry hole, but the upside, if successful, is tremendous. We've begun the permitting process and expect to spud the first well before year end. We'll keep you informed of our progress.","Shifting gears, we published an update to our Marcellus analyst slide this morning. We updated our acreage position to add 20,000 acres that we acquired over the past few quarters. We also framed the fourth Marcellus development area in the dry window of northern West Virginia. We have 30,000 net acres in this area. There are about 300 locations and we have 46 producing wells there. The EURs are about 15% less than our wet West Virginia acreage but about 25% higher than Central Pennsylvania. We are drilling 18 wells in the area this year. We also published an upper Devonian type curve for the first time. As those of you that have listened in the past, we like to wait for data from actual wells before publishing type curves. We estimate a mid-40% return from our upper Devonian wells. Finally, we increased the average EUR of our Southwest Pennsylvania acreage to reflect better performance from the wells drilled there.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Porges","Thanks, Steve. I would like to comment on the status of our pipeline projects and the related topic of our current thoughts on the EQM GP. Before giving specifics on the status of 3 pipeline projects, however, I'd like to provide a strategic overview. With the growth in production volumes in our region, we have become quite confident that there will be many attractive Midstream investment opportunities. In fact, I believe there will be more opportunities over time than we can prudently pursue. Therefore, we need to prioritize our selection criteria and also make sure that EQT and EQM are prepared for this sustained growth.","The primary drivers of our prioritization are: the overall attractiveness of the project; its fit with our existing assets; its fit with the objectives of EQT production and other Equitrans customers; its ability to access attractive markets; and the flexibility it affords in accessing multiple markets. As to specifics, at the time of our first quarter call, EQT Midstream Partners or EQM had an active open season on a project that connects our Equitrans system to pipes in eastern Ohio, the so-called Ohio Valley Connector or OVC. We announced today that we are moving forward with OVC and that it will be built by EQM as an organic growth project.","This 36-mile pipeline extension will connect our transmission system in northern West Virginia to Clarington, Ohio. There, the pipeline will interconnect with both the Rockies Express Pipeline and the Texas Eastern Pipeline. The current project scope is estimated to cost approximately $300 million and will provide about 1 Bcf per day of capacity. The estimated in-service date is mid-2016. EQT has contracted for $650 million cubic feet per day of OVC capacity, and EQM has actively engaged with other shippers to firm up contracts for the remaining capacity.","Next, I'd like to update you on the Ohio Express project. As you may recall, this project originated through requests from producers seeking to move gas from Clarington to liquidity points further west in Ohio. Since completing our open season, we have re-assessed our priorities and Ohio Express has slipped below other projects. So it is on the back burner at least for the near future. And finally, the third of the projects, the project supplanting that amongst our priorities, is the Mountain Valley Pipeline project or MVP, which we announced in the second quarter. MVP is designed to serve the southeast markets by extending our transmission system through West Virginia to Southern Virginia.","This 330-mile pipeline is expected to have a capacity of about 2 Bcf per day and has 2 anchor shippers, including EQT Production who have already agreed to a total of 1 Bcf per day of capacity. The nonbinding open season for MVP ended in mid-July. We are encouraged by the interest expressed by shippers and are now working toward precedent agreements with those shippers.","We expect MVP to be constructed and owned by a joint venture with NextEra Energy with EQT as operator and largest owner. Once the project size and scope become clearer, we will determine whether the project belongs at EQM or EQT. The reason MVP has become a higher priority is that we believe the southeast offers one of, if not the, most attractive market in terms of future natural gas demand growth, as well as an attractive price environment. We think southeast markets can support multiple Bcf per day of new supply to satisfy the expected demand growth and continue to offer strong pricing relative to Appalachian Basin pricing. We will keep you updated.","Moving to the GP. As you know, our ownership of the EQM general partners entitles us to a growing proportion of the MLP distributions. Per the incentive distribution rights or IDR schedule, the GP receives 50% of incremental quarterly distributions, about $0.525 per limited partner unit. The purpose of IDR is to align the GP interest with the limited partner interest by incenting increases in quarterly distributions. We will pass this key milestone of $0.525 later this year.","The quarterly LP distribution that will be paid next month is $0.52 per unit and EQM has given guidance that it plans on increasing the distribution by $0.03 per quarter through at least 2016. GP distributions are determined based on 2 variables: distribution per unit and LP units outstanding. Therefore, forecasting the cash payment to the GP is rather straightforward. In our updated analyst presentation, we laid out a schedule of GP cash flows based on assumptions for these 2 variables.","One, is that the $0.03 per unit increase in quarterly distributions continues through 2019. This appears very achievable given the visibility of distributable cash flow growth at the MLP from organic growth and future accretive drop downs. The second assumption is that the rate of drops from EQT to EQM is $75 million of EBITDA each year for the next 3 years, which EQM finances using a 50-50 debt equity mix.","As EQT still has almost $200 million of Midstream EBITDA, and is investing over $350 million in Midstream this year, the drop inventory needed to support this assumption is already in service or being built. If EQM continues to have success there will, of course, be new products or additional drops. Along these lines, neither OVC nor MVP is explicitly assumed to occur but we did assume a 4% terminal growth rate in distributable cash flow after 2019. We are planning for more rapid growth post 2019 than that, but this assumption is consistent with what we have seen from investment banks, so we used it as a benchmark to assess the value of GP cash flows.","As you will see on the slide in the analyst presentation, the GP cash flow increases dramatically. It grows from less than $15 million in 2014 to nearly $200 million in 2019. The relatively low GP cash flow in 2014 shows why we need to be a bit patient in taking action to realize the GP value. While our estimate of the present value of the pretax cash flow was nearly $4 billion, it seems unlikely that EQT investors would pay the multiple of 2014 cash flow needed to achieve that valuation inside EQT. We believe that our GP stake is quite valuable and we are on track to decide around year end on the best path to realizing that value for our shareholders.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and we appreciate your continued support. And with that, I will turn the call back to Pat.","Patrick John Kane","Thank you, Dave. That concludes the comments portion of the call. Dana, can we please now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A few questions here. First, maybe if you guys could just follow-on to what you were just saying at the very end there, you mentioned and I would agree with you about the material value of the GP, you mentioned by year end you would consider or look at some options for monetization. What are -- can you discuss this maybe in a little bit more detail, some things that maybe you or the board or anybody has talked about at this point? I mean certainly, there is value there, I'm just wondering if any...","David L. Porges","Yes, I think, I'd rather not do that, Neal, other than -- well, first thanks for your question, and I'd rather not do that other than just mention that we are looking at what a lot of other folks have done but frankly, when I've gone through the list of alternatives in the past, it hasn't turned out well. So I just assume, we -- yes, you probably remember. But you just recall that we did -- we've been saying around year end for a little while and we both know that there are, we all know on this call probably, that a number of different companies have gone down this path before they picked different routes. And we've taken a look at a lot of that, and we've used some experts, some investment banks, et cetera, to try to help us think that through. But frankly, I'd just assume we'll leave it at that, if that's okay.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Maybe moving on for Steve. Steve you mentioned about the 400,000 perspective unit acreage and I was glad to see you guys finally breaking this out. Your thoughts on this first well in Greene County, Steve would you think about doing, I guess sort of commingled pads, or you would drill Utica and Marcellus on the one or is this just kind of just that step out test well? How do you foresee sort of developing some of these Utica wells with, say, the Marcellus there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I think, Neal, first of all, we're viewing this first well as a test. So it's an experimental well. We see lots of resource potential, I mean there's a lot of gas in place. I think that's pretty clear to everybody. But there are some challenges. It will be the deepest well we've drilled. It will be the deepest Utica well drilled so far, I believe. So I think it's going to be around 13,500 feet deep. So there are some -- not so much drilling questions, but I think on the completion side we have some questions we need to answer and some tests we need to run. So for now, this is an experimental well. Our view though is, if successful, and depending on the ultimate economics of the Utica development, I think we would develop it on existing pads or in combination with Marcellus drilling. We don't see a need for separate pads or separate facilities. It could all be done in conjunction with each other.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Steve, can I ask one thing here? Does that depth preclude you from taking the lateral out further than you might otherwise or maybe if you can comment around that?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I don't think so. I don't think we're too worried about the drilling aspects. Our test well is planned to be about 6,400 feet. We feel very comfortable with that. And I think, we feel like we'll be able to go longer. Probably our biggest questions in our mind concern the pressures and the stresses, so what's the right propping. We know we won't be able to use sand, so we'll be using most likely ceramic propping. What strength do we need, what sort of pumping pressures are we going to see and pump rates can we get at this depth in those pressures. So a lot of experimentation to do. We're kind of sort of in a new frontier here in terms of depth and pressures. So there's -- we have some questions to answer on this first well.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Hanold from RBC.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe if I can follow-up since we're talking about the Utica well right now. So when you step back and look at, I know it's really early today, but given what you know on what you think the cost could be, I mean, what do you think you need to get out of this well to make it economic and then I'll say, along with that then you make it competitive with some of the higher return projects you have in your portfolio?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I think, probably the simplest way to think about it, back of the envelope, is the wells are going to cost twice as much as a Marcellus well, so they're going to have to produce twice as much to be competitive. They can obviously produce less than that to be economic. But I think our -- given the large inventory of Marcellus opportunities we have, our real goal is to make it competitive with the Marcellus, not just meet our cost to capital. So basically we're looking for double.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And I know you provided a pretty wide range on the cost expectation because, obviously, it's really -- you haven't drilled the well yet, but I mean what would be the ideal cost, maybe, is it that when you say twice the EUR, do you think twice the cost of Marcellus well is also going to be kind of the go forward thought, so if you can get your Marcellus wells down to, say, $6 million, $6.5 million, these are going always to be in that $12 million, $13 million range on the low side?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well, I'm not sure it quite works that way. It's really, the well -- it happens to be about double our estimate but it's really based on the specifics. And because of the depth of the Utica under a lot of the most perspective acreage, they're going to be expensive. And I think that range, the range that we're providing is driven more by what strength casing we're going to need and what kind of horsepower and pressure limits on our frac equipment is going to be required. So those are things that we're going to have to drill a well to find out. But that's why there's such a big range now. And I think a lot of the costs go into higher propping, higher horsepower. So it's -- a lot of the extra costs are coming on the stimulation side. There's a little more cost because of the depth on drilling but it's really driven by increases in our frac-ing needs.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then my follow-up would be then on production. Obviously, this quarter a little bit below expectations because of well timing. Was there any other kind of constraint in the field just due to a line -- high line pressures that you may all have seen or maybe a mix shift in terms of what you completed in the quarter. And I guess what I'm getting to is even with the 4 Bcf, you guys were within your guidance, but it's pretty much been a beaten race story in terms of production historically for you all. So not to be well above, kind of, your production range was a bit of surprise.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes, I mean, I think when we provide guidance, we're giving you our best estimate and sometimes things go more favorably than we expect and sometimes we have some issues that we didn't expect. In this quarter as we mentioned, we had 22 wells that were delayed for a couple of different reasons, mostly around just getting them in line. But just for reference, that's 22 wells from 3 pads on average delayed about 2 weeks. So because of the large number of wells per pad and the large production per well, it doesn't take a long delay to have some fairly significant impact, positive and negative. So if things happen a little faster, our numbers can exceed pretty easily. And if they're a little bit late, they can miss. In the end of the day it's all timing. I think when you look on a calendar year basis, the impacts are pretty minimal.","Operator","Our next question is from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I wanted to ask a question on the GP valuation. If I look at the LP distribution forecast for 2019, it looks like the LP is trading at a 4.8% yield. And then applying the same yield to the GP cash flow in 2019, basically gets you to the $3.9 billion base case valuation. But the GP growth rate doubles in the LP. So my question is, do you think an 8% WAC [ph] is really realistic to use for the GP base case valuation?","Philip P. Conti","We based that WAC [ph] on information we got from various, as Dave mentioned, experts, investment bankers. The range is sort of 7% to 9%. We picked the midpoint, and didn't put a lot more thought into that. We did you give you a table so you could pick a different one, if you'd prefer to.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then can you talk about what percentage of midstream EBITDA is still held at EQT Corp versus EQM?","David L. Porges","Yes. I don't know if we talked about what percentage is there.","Philip P. Conti","It's a little less than $200 million of EBITDA currently, that's still at EQT.","David L. Porges","Roughly 40%.","Operator","Our next question is from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Dave, maybe a couple of strategic questions, lots of cash on the balance sheet, can you just kind of talk about your priorities at this point for use of cash?","David L. Porges","Really, it's just to pursue the strategy that we've had with both the upstream and the midstream. As I think we've said in the past, Holly, we've got no desire to let cash burn a hole in our pocket. I think that it hasn't in the past when we've been in this situation. I understand we went through a period of years where that wasn't the situation. But we will not, for instance, accelerate just because we have cash. It is -- we're going to make what we think are the decisions that are most likely to create value for shareholders. It does factor in a little bit in decisions on whether we build midstream projects at EQM or EQT, but realistically EQM has had access to capital markets at pretty fair pricing since it's been around. So that hasn't really factored into it too much. And we'd also like investors to have a sense that we are in fact able to continue the development programs that are -- represent the optimal development of our resource base for a period of time. That we're not constantly having to look behind the sofa cushion as it were to find extra loose change.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","So no thoughts at this point on further accelerating in the Marcellus?","David L. Porges","Not because of having cash available, no. That would be -- if we look at things with the Marcellus or the Utica or for that matter now, I guess, you would say the Permian, and we think that's the best way to create value, then we'd certainly be interested in doing that. But it isn't -- we try to studiously avoid being affected by the fact that we happen to have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. I think that's a good way to fritter away value over time, and we don't wish to do that.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","You had a good segue into the Permian, maybe just some strategic thoughts there around the deal, I know that you increased the well count for 2014.","David L. Porges","Actually, I'm happy to let Steve comment on the Permian. I think we've talked about the deal as a whole, which was that the Nora was non-core for us and we've known for a long time it was more interesting for Range than it was for us. But I think we've kind of commented on that and the Permian was at the top of our list when we looked at other basins. But as far as what we're up to there, I'll turn that over to Steve.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes, Holly. I think, it's the change in well count is really driven by the fact that we expect to have a rig available in the fourth quarter. And when we think it will be available and get the first well spud. We think we'll likely be able to spud 3 more wells and that well count includes a well started by Range, being finished by us, that we're actually starting a frac job today on that well. So that's well 1 of those and then, 2 or 3 more at the end of the year just to keep the rig running. All Upper Wolfcamp targets in the western part of our acreage position where we feel very comfortable about the economic returns.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I appreciate all the detail on the GP value. Maybe Dave, you can kind of give us some thoughts on EQM's appetite at this point for the remainder of the year for more drops?","David L. Porges","Well, we're still working through that. I don't know that we have anything to announce on further drop timing right now. I will observe that EQM has had a pretty ready access to the capital markets. But for us a lot of is making sure that an asset is ready to drop also, that we have those arm's length agreements. I know we've talked about that in the past, but we've long had tariffs, but you really need to -- with separate entities, you need to make sure you have the full agreement in place and that all other legal aspects are better taken care of as well. So I don't really have any announcements on drops other than we're just going to continue to plug along.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And then my last one would be, maybe for Randy. There's some good detail in the slide presentation on sort of your end market mix and how that shifts in '15. If you could just maybe give us some color on some of those changes, it looks like your M2 exposure goes down in Midwest and NYMEX goes up?","Randall L. Crawford","That's right, Holly. I mean in November our team, 14 [ph] capacity comes into service, which provides us additional access to the Gulf Coast, as well as to northeast markets. And certainly, some of the capacity that we're looking for to go to Midwest that will kick in as well with the OVC into the future. So we feel pretty good around our portfolio right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Amir Arif from Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. For the 400,000-acre Utica position, how much of that is in roughly in Greene County and West Virginia?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I believe, roughly 50,000 acres in Greene County plus or minus a little bit.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And then the West Virginia side?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I don't have that number specifically handy, but it's 150,000 or so.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And are all the Utica rights held by the Marcellus production?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Actually, most of them are held by shallow production or Marcellus but they're nearly 100% held by production.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And the new dry gas area that you've put out there, the 30,000 acres, is that newly acquired acreage or is that acreage you had previously and you just sort of defined as Marcellus now?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","It's a bit of a mix. We did acquire some acreage in that area recently. But I think the bulk of it was existing acreage.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally on the basis for the second half, the $1 to $1.10, could you give some granularity on what you expect in 3Q versus 4Q for that?","Patrick John Kane","I don't think have the details on that but all we did for that guidance was to just take the published strip for the local basis and average it for the 6 months. So we're not really trying to make a prediction that's different than the strip.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","But Pat, generally it's wider in 3Q and then narrows in 4Q. Is that fair?","Patrick John Kane","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A quick question on gas differentials. So what are you seeing so far this quarter on gas differentials and what's your expectation for the rest of the year? And I do see the market mix slide so I'm assuming that you're expecting differentials to improve in 2015?","Patrick John Kane","Joe, we gave a specific forecast on what we think were differentials for the second half of the year. So from a local basis perspective between minus $1 and minus $1.10, but we think because we have capacity and are able to get to some higher-priced markets, we were able to recover $0.60 to $0.65 to kind of a net $0.50 negative.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And am I correct that next year you're expecting the differentials, assuming, say, $4 flat gas to be better than 2014?","Patrick John Kane","We're not really making predictions other than what the strip is. So it's hard to predict.","David L. Porges","Yes. All you're really getting from us is a reflection of what the market shows we're guessing...","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on the GP monetization options. So is it possible that because of the ramp in cash flow that one of the options is actually to wait till some point later when you get a better valuation?","David L. Porges","We're still working through that process. We had, early on, recognized that one of the things that we need to do as part of this process is provide a bit more transparency on GP cash flows to investors and that's the only reason that we put this out when we did. We just -- this is still consistent with our thought process of trying to get to some type of an idea of what we think makes sense by the end of the year. So I really don't have a view on timing beyond -- since we're really just kind of, I guess, you'd say almost like halfway into that process or a little more than halfway I guess.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then any comments on service cost? Are you seeing service cost pressures and any specifics around that?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","No. Service cost has been holding fairly steady over the last quarter. And I think our view is we expect that to continue at least through the next quarter, hopefully, longer. I don't expect certainly any reductions, but we're not really feeling a lot upward pressure at the moment either. I would like to, while I have the microphone, clarify my previous comment. We have 65,000 acres in Greene County with Utica rights.","Operator","Our next question is from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I want to go back to the Permian, did I hear correctly you said all of the wells in the 2014 program are Upper Wolfcamp. Is that right?","David L. Porges","That's correct.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And can you remind us how thick the Wolfcamp is there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I'll be honest, I don't recall off the top of my head.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So thinking ahead to next year, what's the goal of the '15 program? Are you trying to delineate the whole acreage position, are you more trying to hone well design? Can you just provide some color there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","We haven't set out a '15 plan yet. But I think, generically speaking, it won't be to delineate the entire position. I think our strategy will be to -- the bulk of the investment will be focused on the Upper Wolfcamp in the areas where we feel pretty confident about the economics. With some test wells sprinkled in, perhaps, in the Lower Wolfcamp or the Cline. And also with a couple sort of testing the eastern limits, sort of to find out where that economic threshold is going to be on the acreage. But I think the bulk of the investment will be focused on areas we think we can get good returns with some delineation tests sprinkled in.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then on the Ohio Utica, have you completed any of those wells that were waiting on completion?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","We have frac-ed the wells, and they will be flowing them back shortly. As we said previously, we don't intend to provide updates, specific flow information on those wells, but they are on the previous schedule that we talked about.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","All of mine have been answered at this point. But just diving into that recovery line item a little bit more and the guidance around that, the $0.60 to $0.65, positive recovery, how should we think about that kind of going forward? How much of that during the quarter was actually from better pricing versus selling capacity and how much of those prices are on a fixed basis versus floating?","Patrick John Kane","It's a combination -- it's different every period, Michael. So it's really tough to give you specifics. But the intent was that separating the recovery from the expense of transmission, which is what we did in this quarter's presentation, should allow you to take the -- it would give you the sales points where we're selling our gas. So you should be able to use the weighted -- the weighting of the volumes at those points and the pricing at those points to better approximate the net of the local bases and the higher prices at the other sale points. And that would give you -- and that would be reflected in the recovery line would be the higher price portion of it and the basis is basically the first delivery point for our gas.","David L. Porges","And generally speaking, it's -- we're going to have more opportunities when there's a lot of demand in some of those other areas. So for instance, cold weather will help, just as it did in the first quarter. And milder winters would mean that there wasn't as much opportunity, some, but not as much.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","The other question I had as it relates to -- your view, if you have one on seasonality in the Northeast markets and how you see that playing out as we move into '15 and beyond given the increased volumes and the supply dynamics in the Northeast. Do you think points like M3 still exhibit a lot of seasonality going forward or does that get materially muted given the supply situation?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Michael, I mean, obviously, as David said, there's a lot contingent on the weather and the conditions and the power generation load, and in the winter, certainly, there's certain aspects of seasonality as we saw this in our first quarter results in the winter. So there's significant -- our team, and the portfolio approach that we take attempts to maximize our sales priceline by optimizing the portfolio. So I think with regard to M3, we're seeing some significant price advantages this past winter and depending on the conditions, we may very well see a similar result.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sorry to beat on this, but in terms of those contracts. Are all those floating on a price basis or are there material amounts that are fixed price contracts as it relates to the firm transportation you guys have outlined?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes, as I said, we take a portfolio approach, so it changes. But we do have some fixed but we also have others that are out of floating. So that -- overall, we intend to manage our price through a mix of each. I don't have the specific percentages.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","And then, I guess, on the Midstream side of things EQT Midstream, can you just review the growth outlook kind of as you see it for '15 and beyond on EQT Midstream at the EQT level?","Patrick John Kane","Basically, we've been pretty much 20% growth of EBITDA for the last several years. And we haven't given a forecast for volumes for next year but certainly seem to be on track with that to continue.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","That's a 20% growth relative to the growth EBITDA stream rate?","Patrick John Kane","Yes, you have to kind of look at consolidated because of the dynamics of the drops. So if you look at the consolidated Midstream EBITDA, it's a pretty steady growth trajectory. Obviously, whenever you're taking, dropping $100 million or so from one entity to the other midyear, it's going to make the sub-comparison choppy. But if you look at the consolidated growth, it's pretty predictable.","David L. Porges","So basically, it is tracking the production growth. I mean, we're obviously been having more and more that's third-party but generally speaking, we've been trying to organize it so that the projects that support nonaffiliated producers are at the EQM level. So at the EQT level, generally speaking, you're going to wind up seeing results, growth results that track EQT's production growth.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. So that 20% kind of growth rates for the gross EBITDA stream is still reasonable?","Patrick John Kane","It could be.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","And then just I was looking for a little more color on the increase in the EUR on the southwest VA assets, just any additional color there?","David L. Porges","Not really, just a normal update based on results seen to date. So it wasn't a big change but it was enough that we thought we'd communicate it to you. But really nothing more than that.","Operator","Due to the hard stop necessary for your next call, this concludes our question-and-answer session today.

This morning EQT announced third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.35 compared to $0.10 last year. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $560 million for the quarter, a $345 million increase year-over-year. As a reminder, the results of EQGP and EQM are consolidated in EQT's results.","Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $103 million for the quarter compared to $82 million in the third quarter of last year. As a result of the RMP merger with EQM, EQT now conducts its business through four segments; EQT Production, EQM Gathering, EQM Transmission and EQM Water.","Moving on to segment results, starting with EQT Production. Third quarter production sales volumes were 374 Bcfe, within the stated guidance range of 370 Bcfe to 380 Bcfe. Volumes were 82% higher than the third quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of the Rice acquisition.","Our average differential for the quarter was a negative $0.47, $0.38 better than in the third quarter of 2017. Differential improvements year-over-year were offset by lower NYMEX and hedge prices in 2018 and a lower Btu uplift resulting from a larger percentage of our gas being dryer after the Huron divestiture and Rice acquisition.","Though there were improvements in liquid pricing year-over-year, third quarter 2018 total liquids volumes were down by approximately 17% from third quarter 2017 as a result of the Huron and Permian divestitures. This resulted in a flat year-over-year average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, of $2.76 per Mcfe.","Operating revenues were slightly over $1 billion for the third quarter of 2018, which is $452 million higher than the third quarter of 2017 on higher production associated with the Rice acquisition. Total operating expenses, excluding a $259 million loss associated with the Huron divestiture, were $912 million or 56% higher year-over-year. Cash operating costs of $1.35 per Mcfe were 23% lower than last year.","Moving on to Midstream results, EQM Gathering operating income for the third quarter was $178 million, $92 million higher than the third quarter of 2017. Operating revenues were $136 million higher, primarily due to the acquisition of Rice's midstream assets and increased development by EQT and other producers.","Operating expenses for EQM Gathering were $75 million, $44 million higher than the third quarter of 2017, primarily from the acquired assets. EQM Transmission operating income for the third quarter 2018 was $59 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EQM Water reported an operating loss of $3 million.","To conclude, I would like to discuss our cash flow and liquidity position. As of September 30, 2018, EQT had $450 million of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under our $2.5 billion credit facility. We currently forecast $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion of adjusted operating cash flow for 2018 at EQT, which includes approximately $250 million to $300 million from EQT's interest in EQM and EQGP and RMP for the first three quarters of 2018, reflecting the separation timing announced last night.","Our operating cash flow guidance does not reflect anticipated taxes on the separation, which are triggered by the disposition of the Rice Midstream assets within two years of acquisition and are expected to be approximately $100 million. We can utilize a portion of our previously anticipated $200 million tax refund for 2018 to offset this tax liability.","With our forecasted adjusted operating cash flow and cash from asset sales during the year, we expect to fully fund our forecast 2018 capital expenditure plan of $2.7 billion, which includes $2.5 billion for well development.","I'll now turn the call over to Erin Centofanti.","Erin Centofanti - EQT Corporation","Thanks, Jimmi Sue, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start by providing an update on 2018 CapEx. As mentioned in our release this morning, we are increasing our 2018 well development CapEx by $300 million or 14%. These costs represent primarily one-time events that were driven by pace of activity, ultra-long lateral learning curve and some service cost increases.","Our original 2018 development program was designed to have consistent frac and drilling activity throughout the year. However, first quarter weather events and midstream delays disrupted that schedule, requiring us to ramp from 9 to 12 frac crews in Q2 to meet our planned volume. While this work led to a record 94 gross TILs in Q3, the ramp in frac crews, robust pace and concentration of activity all placed stress on our supply chain, logistics and pad operations, increasing our CapEx.","Additionally, as we progress up the learning curve on the ultra-long laterals, meaning those laterals that are between 15,000 and 20,000 feet, early well costs are heavily influenced by trying new techniques and adjusting operating practices as problems occur. This learning curve is no different than what the industry experienced a decade ago, as we determined best practices for the first wave of Marcellus development.","Make no mistake, the economics of longer laterals are compelling. This was a key driver behind our acquisition of Rice and it is a critical component of maximizing the long-term value of our premier acreage position in this basin. Many of the lessons of drilling ultra-long laterals have been learned and are now incorporated, and we will execute better on this program going forward.","Lastly, pressure pumping and water pricing both increased versus planned. The first six months of 2018 represented a tight market for Appalachian frac crews, resulting in higher pricing. The same phenomenon was present in our water hauling operations where increased demands for trucks, a shortage of qualified drivers and new safety requirements for all haulers increased water hauling costs.","As we build our 2019 plan, we are doing so with a manufacturing approach to development. This includes consistent levels of activity, a moderate pace coordinated with infrastructure, extreme focus on capital efficiency versus quarterly volume targets, and implementation of real-time operation centers for all our processes. Many of the lessons of drilling ultra-long laterals have been learned and are now incorporated into our program.","Data governance and analytics teams are in place and we will set measurable operational goals and report the progress to you annually. We are not waiting until January to begin this process. We are currently working at a consistent and moderate pace, which will eliminate future inefficiencies. This decision to moderate activity earlier will result in 30 Bcfe of production being deferred into next year, but will allow us to immediately implement our efficiency model.","As we mentioned in our release, some of these deferred volumes would have been sold in early October at low local pricing of $2 and will now realize Q1 2019 pricing of $2.90. We are committed to effectively deploying capital and believe that the lessons learned in 2018 provide the knowledge and experience to drill longer laterals at the cost profile we originally anticipated. These longer laterals, in addition to our manufacturing model, will be the key to maximizing the long-term value of the world-class asset we have built in this basin.","I will now turn the call over to Rob.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Erin. Today, I'm going to focus on EQT post split. Starting with the time line, as we near the end of the split process, we announced yesterday that the EQT board has approved the separation of our upstream and midstream businesses. We expect Equitrans Midstream will begin trading on a when-issued basis on October 31, and then both EQT and Equitrans will trade on a regular-way basis starting on November 13. And we expect the record date for the distribution to be November 1.","In our updated slide deck, which will be posted this evening, we've included a few slides that highlight the persistent sum-of-the-parts discount that the separation is intended to address. What you see is that if you assume current market prices for the various midstream entities, the remaining EQT upstream business is trading at a very significant discount to our peers.","EQT will enter the next chapter with one of the best asset bases in the country, with 680,000 core Marcellus acres and 2,400 undeveloped locations. We're capable of generating a combination of modest growth and significant free cash flow. We also have one of the strongest balance sheets in a peer group, allowing us to weather low commodity prices and allocate meaningful free cash flow through share buybacks and dividends driving per share returns.","As we've discussed for the past several months, we're transitioning this organization from a volume growth mindset to a capital efficiency mindset. We will operate at a more moderate steady pace and we think that looks like six to seven frac crews on average, which will drive mid-single-digit annual production growth over the next five years. We believe this operational consistency will reduce cost per well, increase productivity per foot and continue our long-term trend of driving down development cost per MCF.","Another advantage of this moderated growth and development pace is the improvement in overall portfolio decline rate. High growth rates mean a greater percentage of production coming from new high decline rate wells. And in a lower growth scenario, where new wells make up a smaller portion of the overall production, baseline decline rates moderate along with capital requirements. This is what drives the shape of our free cash flow profile.","In our current base case forecast, we see annual maintenance level CapEx dropping from approximately $1.8 billion in 2019 to approximately $900 million by 2023. Based on mid-single-digit annual production growth case, we anticipate approximately $200 million of free cash flow in 2019 and $2.1 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the five year period.","With respect to 2019, we are providing the following high-level guidance. We expect CapEx of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion, net sales volumes of 1,470 Bcfe to 1,510 Bcfe and EBITDA of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. We're in the midst of working through our annual budget process, which we will present to the board in December. Consistent with our practice, we will give formal 2019 guidance at that time.","We do understand that this quarter's operational update is a disappointment to shareholders. It certainly is a disappointment to me and this team as we underperformed our asset base in 2018. As the incoming CEO, I am committed to reshaping our culture to one that's focused on capital efficiency and per share returns as opposed to purely chasing volume targets.","To close out my remarks, I would like to say thank you to all of the EQT and soon-to-be Equitrans employees as well as our advisors for a truly amazing job in getting these two strong businesses ready to be independent. It was a herculean effort that was flawlessly executed in record time. Great job.","I'd also like to thank Dave Porges for his many years of excellent leadership and strategic vision at EQT. We're very grateful to Dave for stepping back in to the interim CEO role earlier this year in what was a very dynamic time at EQT.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, Blake.","Blake McLean - EQT Corporation","Thanks, Rob. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Doug, can we please now open the line up to questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Wanted to start with regards to the some of the costs and related lateral points that you mentioned, and really more as it focuses on the going forward. Can you talk about the services environment that you expect when you think about a CapEx budget in the range that you're at least initially indicating, whether you see that falling or rising and what the risks are around that? And then also on lateral length, can you talk about the challenges that you faced a bit more, whether there's any upper limits that you're seeing and what's baked into your \u2013 the production and CapEx expectations in the plan?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So on the cost side, we really saw the tightness in cost escalation in midyear when we were running \u2013 at one point, we were running 12 frac crews, 15 rigs, and on a daily basis would have something like 500 trucks on the road. That's where we saw the tightness and the costs increased. Now, as we've gotten into the fourth quarter, we backed off on that pace and we're down, I think, seven today frac crews and getting to a level where we expect to run long-term. And so those costs have come down and we expect that to continue. So, on the cost side, the higher costs that we saw through the middle part of the year have abated as we reduced our activity.","On the lateral lengths, with the Rice acquisition, we all of a sudden have found ourselves with a land position that gave us the opportunity to go from, on average of 8,000-foot laterals to almost 14,000-feet. But mixed in there were quite a number of laterals that were between 15,000 feet and 20,000 feet and many in the kind of 18,500 feet range, which present a whole new set of challenges, stretching rigs to the limits of their capabilities. And in hindsight, we probably tried to drill too many of those ultra-long laterals in 2018. I think that there is potential upside in drilling those longer than 15,000 foot laterals, but we need to do it at a more measured pace so that we can incorporate the learnings into the next well as opposed to having multiple ultra-long laterals going at once.","So I think what you'll see from us and what's baked into our 2019 thinking so far is that the majority of the wells that we drill will be more like 12,000 feet to 15,000 feet, and that the ones that are beyond 15,000 feet, we'll take much more measured view of. And we will work out many of the issues and be able to extend the laterals, but the blocking and tackling drilling will likely be less than 15,000-foot laterals.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And my follow-up is just a couple of quick numbers clarifications, and sorry for this. The $2 billion to $2.2 billion in at least indicated 2019 CapEx, does that include the ongoing leasehold? So is that comparable to the $2.7 billion or is that comparable to the $2.5 billion? And then, when you talk about $200 million of expected free cash flow in 2019, does that incorporate any of the one-off tax benefit inflows?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So, on the first part of the question, that's the all-in CapEx number. It does include the land CapEx, so it's comparable to the $2.7 billion. And there is \u2013 correct me if I am wrong, about $100 million of tax gain in 2019 that's included in that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Just back onto some of the things you're seeing on the long laterals. I mean, when you step back and look at it is \u2013 on this go forward development program, in your minds, I mean is there really \u2013 I mean do you see a benefit long-term of doing the longer laterals? And fundamentally, could you be just kind of finding a sweet spot in the 12,000 foot to 15,000 foot? And what implications does that have on to some of those synergies we talked about during the Rice acquisition by putting the two acreage positions together?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yes. So, we do think that there probably is a sweet spot and maybe it's in that 14,000 foot to 15,000 foot range where when you get beyond that, your incremental cost per foot starts to creep back up because the problem wells get to be big problems. But what we found as an industry for many years is that what seems really tough today tomorrow people start figuring out.","So I think what you'll see from us is we're not going to go both feet in drilling 17,000 foot and 18,000 foot laterals. We will do one here and there, but the vast majority of the wells that we drill going forward will be at less than 15,000 feet. And in that range, the wells are \u2013 we're much more consistent. We don't have the surprises that we do with the ultra-long laterals.","But I would like to reemphasize. The move from 8,000 feet to 14,000 feet or 15,000 feet is huge in terms of economic efficiency. So we think that the gain that came from being able to extend that \u2013 the laterals to that kind of length is very real. It's just going from there to north of 15,000 feet is more problematic.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. But specifically on the synergies, some of those synergies you discussed, does that change now, knowing what you know on costs and lateral lengths to what we would have thought, say, nine months ago?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","No, no. When we thought through the synergies from Rice, we didn't contemplate wells longer than 14,000 feet or 15,000 feet. In fact, if you remember back to the guidance that we gave in late 2017 sometime, what we originally expected to average in 2018 was 12,000 foot laterals. So we were able to go significantly longer than that. It's just that the longest 20 or so wells that were longer than 15,000 feet, there's a real learning curve associated with that, and frankly, just the physics limitation of the rig and pressure pumping when you get out to those lateral lengths.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate that. And then, also appreciate the view on strategically we're going to 2019 and beyond. And you sort of made a comment of mid-single digits growth kind of over the next five years. And do you see constraints in that \u2013 beyond that, or are you just kind of isolating your comments to the next five years? And if you can dial in what mid-single digits means a little bit more, that'd be appreciated.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yes. So five years is a arbitrary time period that we think just gives enough visibility into the business that it's an appropriate timeframe, but there's nothing magic about the five years. If we spun it out further, it would look very similar. And we're not probably ready to give you more specific guidance than mid-single-digits, but I would take that for what it is. It's the middle of the pack. So 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, something that range. And we think at that pace \u2013 and really, what was driving that, it was not a growth rate target, but rather an operational target of running somewhere between 6 and 8 frac crews or 5.5 and 7.5 frac crews, which we think is a really prudent way to develop the asset where we can be the most capital efficient. It drives modest growth and generates real free cash flow of over $2 billion in that timeframe. So we think that that's a model that for a company the size of EQT makes a lot of sense.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay. That's great. And sorry, I'm just going to just add a related question to that. When you give your 2019 budget, do you plan on providing some more details to that longer-term outlook or is that one of those things we'll just get year-by-year?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","No, we likely will give more color on the out-years as well when we announce our 2019 budget. Of course, the most granularity will come around 2019 that we will likely give more visibility beyond that as well.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. I was just going to follow-up on the prior two questions around free cash flow and the priority of return of cash to shareholders. How you guys are thinking about dividends versus buybacks and how you expect that cadence of return of cash to proceed starting next year?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So in terms of how we would split free cash flow between dividends and share buybacks, we do think that there is value in a modest but growing dividend, but that is constrained by a belief that in a highly cyclical business like natural gas and that a large dividend that stresses the cash flows that it is hard to manage in a downturn is probably too much. So if I had to try to ballpark it, I would say that we'd be more like three quarters spend on share buybacks versus dividends, but that can move around some.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for that.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","I'm sorry, Drew, there was another part to the question. I've forgotten.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, on the cadence, so you talked about $200 million of free cash flow next year. I think Dave had talked about using some of the retained SpinCo shares to fund buybacks or cash return on the last call or maybe it was that first quarter call, talking about that being one aspect, but not being very specific on when you would monetize those shares. So just curious as how that free cash flow progress and cash return.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So we're going to do the smart economic thing with the retained shares. So I think that there's likely to be some noise in the trading in early days for Equitrans and likely EQT as well. So we're not going to rush out the door to try to sell those shares. So we want to do it when we can get the best economic bang for our buck. But we look at that as capital to be deployed for really three things. It's for de-levering the balance sheet as much as we need to, for share buybacks and potentially to fund dividends. And what we've said a number times here in the past, call it, six months is that we really want to target a leverage level that's somewhere between 1.5 and 2 times debt-to-EBITDA. And I'd say that my personal view is that the lower end of that is probably the right range for us to be in. And so that would push us towards using the majority of that retained stake to delever the balance sheet a bit further post-spin.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for that color. I am sorry, just to clarify on the cash return piece. It sounds like for next year, assuming you don't monetize the shares early on next year, probably buybacks or a big increase in dividends probably less likely.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yes, I think that's fair.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Rob.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Drew.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Kind of coming back to some of the questions, on the long-term free cash flow outlook, just curious what sort of price assumptions are behind that and how you're treating MVP in the context of that?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","The price assumptions were stripped for 2019 and then $2.80 for the four years after that of NYMEX and then the local basis of $0.50. And then...","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And then \u2013 sorry, go ahead.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","And then MVP, the assumption is that it comes on at the end of 2019.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then, in the context of the maintenance capital, I think you mentioned that there's some obviously moving parts around base decline. How should we think about the progression of your base decline? What's that look like currently and what does that get to by the end of that five-year outlook?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. Currently, it's just a little over 30% is the basic line rate. And by year five, it gets down to mid-teens.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then, I guess last...","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","It's not exactly linear. It's higher in 2019 and 2020 and then takes a pretty big step down in 2021 and then flattens out between 2021 and 2023.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay that's helpful. And then, last of mine, I guess, is the \u2013 on the 2019 outlook, how should we think about, given all the kind of challenges on the lateral lengths front, what do you think is a fair average lateral length to contemplate for 2019? And then, how many turn-in-line should we be contemplating as well?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","The lateral length, I think they'll be in the same ballpark as this year kind of at 12,000 foot to 13,000 foot or 14,000 foot average laterals. The TILs, do you know what the TILs are, Erin?","Erin Centofanti - EQT Corporation","Believe it's around 170.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. And then that will \u2013 that TIL rate will come down pretty dramatically over the next few years as the base decline rate drops.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, appreciate the color. Thanks.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Welles Fitzpatrick from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Morning.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","It sounds like all the issues on the ultra-long laterals are really in the D&C portion, but I was wondering if maybe we could get an update on some of those longer ones that you've drilled, maybe the Harbison and the Haywood. Are those guys still sort of at or above that 2.4 Bcf per 1,000 lateral foot curve?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","(00:31:28)","Erin Centofanti - EQT Corporation","Yes. They're still currently meeting our expectations.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then, is there any way \u2013 could you guys break out the costs versus the learning curve on that $300 million CapEx bump or is it just too kind of mushed up?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So about a half of the costs were inefficiencies from running so many rigs, so many frac crews, the logistics issues that came with that, about half of that is tied to those inefficiencies. And then a portion is increased service costs that we saw during that period that have now abated and a quarter or so is from the \u2013 of the cost is from the problem wells in the ultra-long laterals.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, perfect. That's all I have. Thank you.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, guys.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Holly.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Just maybe a follow-up on that last question. Just you mentioned several of the cost escalation just being sort of one-time. Can you maybe just give us new well cost numbers as you're thinking about it for either in the plan currently for 2018 or even looking at 2019 for Marcellus and Utica and whether you can give us either on the lateral-adjusted basis or overall well cost?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Well, on a per foot basis, 2018 is going to be significantly higher than what we expected. It's going to be over $1000 of lateral foot versus more like $900 or $915 is what we would've expected. And we'll expect for 2019 that we're back down in that $900 range per lateral foot.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe, Rob, just is there \u2013 I'm assuming the rating agencies have continued to watch what we're doing here on the spin. Is there any signal in terms of keeping EQT at that investment-grade level?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","We do expect to be able to keep EQT at the investment-grade level. That's the indication we've had through the conversations with all three agencies.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, great. And then maybe one final for me. Just given the increase that we've seen in NGL pricing, is there any thought at this point in that 2019 plan on sort of shifting any of this activity from Southwest PA into West Virginia to pick up more of that NGL uplift?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","I mean, certainly that weighs in the economics and we consider that. The difficulty, though, is that in West Virginia, we're still drilling significantly shorter laterals. So even with some liquids component that does help on realizations, it still doesn't compete very well with drilling 12,000 and 14,000 foot laterals in Greene or Washington counties.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, that's helpful. Sorry, maybe just one final one, if I could. Is there any change in the hedging philosophy here now going forward?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","There's not a change in the hedging philosophy necessarily, but when we see forward pricing that we like, we've seen some decent pricing in 2019, and at least for the near term, we're likely to layer in a bit more on the hedges. But in terms of hedging heavier further out, there's no real change in philosophy.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, great. Thanks.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Holly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Good morning. Could you help us with the pro forma, how you look at pro forma 2018 production? Just trying to reconcile the 1,470 Bcfe to 1,510 Bcfe guidance versus 2018. Am I right in assuming that there was about 40 Bs (00:35:47) of production at Huron and anything else in the Permian? So, Rob, if you could just give us a sense of what you think the pro forma year-over-year percentage growth is on volumes, that'd be helpful.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yes, we think \u2013 so pro forma for the Huron sale, backing that out and the little bit that was in West Texas, we think that the pro forma production is about 1,430 Bcfe in 2018.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, the other question is, I guess, you mentioned a little bit in terms of the timing of MVP, but am I right in assuming that EQT does not need to grow any \u2013 you don't have to drill to fill in terms of MVP and that you can divert volumes locally. So none of this growth is in order to meet your volume commitments on MVP?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","That's correct.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Group LLC","And final one for me was just, is there any major moves in your assumptions on your transmission and midstream costs, as you look out to 2021, 2022, maybe just directionally? I think you mentioned before in terms of the cost of MVP, but can you just help us (00:37:03) any major changes in those assumptions?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","There are no major changes in those assumptions. The big change is when MVP comes online. So 2020, 2021, all of the out-years after 2019 will have MVP transportation charges, but also will have the uplift for better end markets as well.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Panjwani with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Morning.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","So you continue to shift away from the Upper Devonian and the Utica, which makes sense as you move to a more moderated program and have a higher focus on capital efficiency. But how should we think about activity outside of the Marcellus over this next five-year period?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","The activity outside of the Marcellus \u2013 our overall activity will be dominated by Marcellus. I don't know, Erin, if you have that stat in front of you. What you think it will be?","Erin Centofanti - EQT Corporation","Yeah. I think you can assume roughly 30 wells a year in the Ohio Utica and we won't have any in the Upper Devonian going forward.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then, on the maintenance CapEx numbers, I think the previous messaging was about $1.2 billion on average for five years. And the updated commentary, if I just kind of do the rough math, I mean, on the two endpoints, it implies about 10% higher on average. And so is there something that's driving the change there or am I just reading too much into that?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","No, your math is about right, except that the shape of that curve is not linear. So what you'll see is that the first two years 2019 and 2020, that maintenance CapEx number is much higher, $1.7 billion \u2013 or $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion or something like that, but then it drops off significantly in years three, four and five. And so the average of $1.2 billion that we have talked about previously it's still right. It's just that the shape of that is not exactly linear.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. That's great color. Thank you.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Sameer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Melinda Newman with TCW. Please proceed with your question.","Melinda Jocelyn Newman - TCW Asset Management Co. LLC","Hi. Can you go over again your CapEx guidance for EQT stand-alone next year, which looks like it's something like a \u2013 maybe like a 20% reduction versus the number of frac crews and rigs you intend to be running next year because it seems like when you talk about six or seven frac crews ongoing, that's like a 40% decline? And I know you said you ultimately think you'll get the CapEx down to below $1 billion, but what is the exact cause of the mismatch in the decline next year? And am I \u2013 the production guidance you gave, it's just about a 1% production increase. Is this like extra cost because you had a plan that was a faster growth plan and made commitments based on that plan and now, there's a cost associated with taking that back to a more modest growth plan?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","I'm not sure I understood the question, but I'll answer what I think I heard. So it is not a 1% growth in volumes. It's more like 5% growth if you pro forma the 2018 volumes for the sale of the Huron. And so I think that pro forma number is about 1430 Bcfe. And so it's more like 5% or so growth.","And the $2 billion to $2.2 billion is consistent with the maintenance level, just keeping production flat, CapEx number of about $1.8 billion and then the rest is for the growth volumes. But remember, matching CapEx and production changes in the current \u2013 in a single period is always a bit off because the CapEx you spend in a period really will affect the production in the next period, not the period that you're in.","Melinda Jocelyn Newman - TCW Asset Management Co. LLC","Yeah, understood. Can you give again what you think \u2013 I don't know if you're already gave it. You gave us an ultimate aim for frac crews, but what do you think your frac crews and rig count will be for 2019?","Erin Centofanti - EQT Corporation","Six to seven frac crews in 2019 and around 10 horizontal rigs.","Melinda Jocelyn Newman - TCW Asset Management Co. LLC","Okay. So it's really the proportion of less frac crews per rig, basically.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","And the rigs will come down over time. But in 2018, we're down now to, I think, it's seven frac crews, but we were as high as 12 mid-year. So what we intend to do and maybe this doesn't quite come through in our comments, but it is we intend to run at a steady pace. Moving towards a manufacturing model where we can deploy capital in the most efficient manner as opposed to ramping up and down, which is always very expensive when you're mobing and de-mobing frac crews or rigs.","Melinda Jocelyn Newman - TCW Asset Management Co. LLC","Yeah. I mean, I'll let you go on, but the basic issue is that there's disproportionate \u2013 there's a bigger reduction in frac crews, rigs, I believe, than there is a reduction in CapEx. Okay. Thank you.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah, And just to follow on that, you'll see that the CapEx piece will continue to decline as the base decline rates continue to decline for any given growth rate or for a maintenance level.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ray Deacon with HS Energy Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Raymond J. Deacon - HS Energy Advisors LLC","I'm sorry. I was on mute. My question was regarding the \u2013 what the 15,000 lateral type curve would look like or will you be putting on out? I know you have a 12,500 foot with about 4 Bcf of cumulative production in year one. I guess is it just ratable if I add somewhere around 10% to the EURs on your current type curve? Will that work?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I mean, the type curves that we put out are based on a per foot basis or the type curve right now is 2.4 Bcf per 1,000 feet of lateral. And so at 12,000 feet and 15,000 feet, the per foot EUR is still the same. So you can just multiply that.","Raymond J. Deacon - HS Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, got it. And I know you had talked about the Upper Devonian being sort of a use it or lose it formation in the past that you wouldn't be able to go back and get it.

Please refer to the morning\u2019s press release for information on these non-GAAP financial measures.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip Conti","Thanks, Pat, and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2011 earnings of $3.19 per diluted share, compared to $1.57 per diluted share in 2010. After adjusting for several items which accumulatively added $148.4 million to our net income, our adjusted EPS was $2.21 in 2011.","The adjustments to net income include the impacts of the sale of Big Sandy Pipeline in the third quarter, the purchase of the outstanding interest in ANPI in the second quarter, the sale of the Langley Natural Gas Processing Complex, and an adjustment for non-income tax matters in the first quarter, and a gain on the sale of some available for-sale securities in the first half of the year.","Operating cash flow, which was not significantly impacted by these items in 2011 also increased by $236 million or by about 36%. These results were driven by another outstanding operational year at each of EQT\u2019s business units.","Leading the way on the annual operating performance was a 44% increase in sales of produced natural gas and liquids at EQT production, which represented our highest annual sales growth rate ever. The other volumes at EQT Midstream also increased by 32%, trending up with the higher volumes at EQT Production.","The EQT average wellhead sales price was $5.37 per Mcf in 2011, or about $0.25 lower than in 2010. The realized price drop resulted from lower NYMEX natural gas prices in \u201911 as compared to \u201910, partially offset by higher natural gas liquids prices. Approximately 7% of EQT\u2019s total production in 2011 was in the form of liquids.","For segment reporting purposes, of that $5.37 per Mcf of revenue, realized by EQT Corporation, $4.04 per Mcf was allocated to EQT Production, and the remaining $1.33 per Mcf to EQT Midstream.","Overall, absolute cost increase is expected given our outstanding growth rate, but on a unit basis, the total cost to produce, gather, process and transport EQT\u2019s produced natural gas and NGLs was down about 22%.","The fourth quarter results basically mirrored the full year, so I do not intend to discuss them in detail. However, I will point out that the revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing, and transportation was $0.43 for the full year of 2011 and $0.29 in the fourth quarter, as shown in the table, in this morning\u2019s press release.","The fourth quarter number was positively impacted by the company\u2019s ability to resell it\u2019s unused contractive capacity on the recently completed El Paso 300 line, at unit rates above what we currently pay under the existing agreement with El Paso. The margin from capacity that was sold under short-term contracts, that is contracts with a duration of less than a year, reduced the revenue deduction by about $0.12 per Mcf on gas sold by EQT in the quarter.","Put another way, by adding the $0.12 to the $0.29 reported in the fourth quarter, a reasonable per-unit rate \u2013 run rate for the deduction for third-party gathering, processing, and transportation in models, would be approximately $0.41 for Mcf.","This number will be impacted positively or negatively going forward, depending on market rates we will receive for the resell of our 300 line capacity that is not currently reserved for EQT Production, or under long-term resell contracts with third-parties.","Moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segments, starting with EQT Production, and there, as has been the case for several years now, the big story in the quarter at EQT Production was the growth rate in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was a little bit north of 44% for the year, and was slightly north of 37% for the quarter. By the way, the sixth straight consecutive quarter of more than 35% rolling year-over-year growth. Those growth rates were driven by sales from our Marcellus wells, which contributed 42% of the volumes in 2011.","In the fourth quarter, Marcellus sales volumes accounted for 47% of the total volumes. Total sales volume would have been about 300 Mcf equivalent higher for the year and the quarter but for a dehydration equipment malfunction in December.","Unit realized price at EQT Production was slightly, or about 3% higher than last year, even as the corporations realized price declined a bit as I already mentioned. This is one of the benefits of an increase in the Marcellus sales percentage, as the Marcellus gathering rate is $0.60 per Mcf, compared to $1.25 per Mcf for the majority of our other production.","Moving on to expenses in the production unit. Total operating expenses were $90 million higher, year-over-year. Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth.","DD&A represented about $73 million of the $90 million increase. Absolute LOE was a bit higher year-over-year, however volume increases have been outpacing the general trend of higher absolute expenses. And as you would expect, per unit LOE was lower in 2011 by about $0.04, or 17% to $0.20 per Mcfe for the full-year 2011.","Moving on to the Midstream business, excluding the gains of the Big Sandy and Langley sales, operating income here was up about 19%, consistent with the 32% growth in gathered volumes, mainly from EQT Productions growing sales volume, and that resulted in a 18% increase in gathering, net operating revenues.","Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 7% year-over-year as a result of added equitrans capacity from the Equitrans-Marcellus expansion project, an increased throughput, more than offsetting revenues no longer received by \u2013 received from the Big Sandy pipeline.","On the other hand, the line item titled storage, marketing, and other net operating income was down, up $7 million in the fourth quarter, and $35 million for the full year. This part of the Midstream business, as we talked repeatedly about it, it relies on seasonal volatility and spreads and the forward curve, and those continue to trend down in 2011 versus prior years.","Also, the loss of processing fees from Langley third-party liquids, resulted in lower marketing revenues. For 2012, we expect revenues from storage, marketing and other to be approximately $45 million.","Net operating expenses at Midstream were about $27 million lower year-over-year, lower O&M and DD&A expenses which collectively were $28 million lower year-over-year, represent basically the entire absolute decrease in Midstream expenses. The absence of expenses associated with the sole Big Sandy and Langley assets and reductions in non-income tax reserves, resulted in those decreases.","Then in conclusion with finally, with our standard liquidity update. We did close the year in a great liquidity position with $0 in net short-term debt outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver, and about $830 million of cash on the balance sheet.","As detailed in the press release, due to the current low natural gas price environment, we have lowered our cash flow forecast for 2012 by about $100 million, and therefore consistent with our intent to live within our means, the company has decided to discontinue drilling Huron wells. As a result, our 2012 CapEx forecast decreased by about $135 million to $1.465 billion for 2012.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Porges.","David Porges","Thank you, Phil. 2011 was another record year for EQT. Earnings per share, operating cash flow, sales volumes, Midstream throughput and natural gas reserves were all higher than ever before. Though the primary purpose of this call is to communicate with investors, I first wish to convey my congratulations for these accomplishments to the 1,800-plus employees of EQT Corporation. Having such a strong group managing our assets gives me confidence that we will continue to earn premium returns for our shareholders.","Sales of produced natural gas and liquids were 44% higher than in 2010. This is on top of 30% growth in 2010 over 2009. Put another way, our daily sales volumes, when we exited 2009 totalled 300 million cubic feet. We exited 2011 at 580 million cubic feet per day, 93% higher in just two years. The Marcellus continues to drive our growth. Marcellus Production accounted for 47% of our sales of produced natural gas in the fourth quarter.","EQT has tremendous assets. While our objective is to maximize value creation rather than volume creation from these assets, the only practical way to do so is by economically monetizing our extensive reserve base, be it production and other means, and by extracting value from our Midstream assets and Midstream opportunities. However, we believe it is also necessary that we live within our means financially, without issuing equity.","In 2011, I believe we made great strides towards doing so, but the work continues. I\u2019d like to review a little of how we did this in 2011, and also how we intend to do so in 2012. In 2011 we invested $1.4 billion in to our business. We funded this investment with $900 million of operating cash flow, plus $620 million of Midstream asset sales. The proceeds from the asset sales came from the outright sale of two assets. We examined other structures and assets, but determined that selling these two assets outright was the best approach. For 2012, we have decided that the best approach to create value is again investing our operating cash flow, plus also utilizing other available capital. This other capital includes utilizing our investment grade debt capacity, which we did in late 2011, and further monetizing Midstream assets by forming a MLP.","As we announced last month, we plan to file the S1 this quarter, though we recognize that this merely starts the process with the SEC. The advantages to EQT shareholders of forming a MLP include maintaining operational control of where, when, ad to what speck gathering is built, access to a on-going source of low cost capital, and participation in any MLP distribution growth. Of course, a publically traded currency would also provide a market view of the value of the MLPs assets.","Our objective, maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing this, the ammonization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities, while living within our means, is also largely unaffected by the changes we have experienced lately.","Tactics, however can and should change. Despite of a bit of a rebound this week, natural gas prices are down sharply since we established our capital budget in December. Lower prices impact us in two ways. First they reduce cash flow from operations and less cash available for investments.","We have over 50% of our dry gas hedged in a average price of $5.43 and about 7% of our production in the form of NGLs and oil. And incidentally, recall we include ethane in our dry gas numbers since the [inaudible] for ethane are essentially equivalent to methane on a per Btu basis.","Even so, based on cases we ran, using last week\u2019s lows for the 2012 strip, our 2012 cash flow estimates were almost $100 million lower than when we established our capital budget. Lower prices also reduced the projected returns of our drilling program. Marcellus returns are still strong at the current five year strip, about $3.90. We also stress test our investments and the projected are still adequate at [inaudible] strip. Please do keep in mind that the lags between spending capital on Marcellus wells and selling natural gas produced from those wells is several months, meaning the relevant five year strip when looking at 2012 investments is actually the 2013 to 2017 strip, which is currently somewhat north of $4. Therefore, it is clear to us that investments in developing our Marcellus play, are attractive though they would obviously be even more attractive at higher prices.","Regarding our Huron wells, even though they are liquids rich, the returns are still below the Marcellus wells. But since lower prices mean a reduction in operating cash flow and we are commitment to living within our means, something has to give. That something is the Huron, and this is why we have suspended drilling in that play effective immediately. We will complete the wells that we have already \u2013 that have already been spud, and continue to produce from existing wells.","This decision will reduce our 2012 CapEx by about $135 million, and reduce our forecast of sales of produced natural gas by approximately 5 Bcfe. The effect of this decision of volumes in the out years is the decline of 6 Bcfe in 2013, and a little over 3 Bcfe in 2014. The fact that the lag between drilling and sales in the Huron is much less than in the Marcellus, is why the 2012 impact is as large as this, and the 2013\/2014 impacts are as small as they are.","Normally, one might lean away from cutting spending in a area in which we experience a shorter lag, but 2012 is not shaping up as a normal year.","I\u2019d now like to comment on our reserve report, which was released today. Our continued success in the Marcellus resulted in a 535 Bcfe or 18.5% increase in prude reserves. This increase was partially offset by a 413 Bcfe decrease in Huron prude reserves, and we eliminated all of the prude undeveloped reserves, consistent with our decision to suspend drilling of Huron wells.","I remain confident that this play has value for our shareholders, but we are not going to be pursuing that value in the near future, so we\u2019re moving these PUDs now, seemed appropriate. Further regarding reserves, we continued to have success with our experiment with tighter frac clusters. As we previously noted, this design works best in the more brittle areas of our play. Brittleness is also positively correlated with higher EURs using the standard frac design.","With the year of well [inaudible] in Rogersville, Green County, we estimate an IP 40% higher than a standard frac well, with EURs trending, 20 to 25% higher. Our 2012 plan includes 49 wells using this design, with about half applied where we have well control, and half to these risk areas where predict success. We still do not have enough data to book many reserves, or extrapolate these results across our acreage, but are excited about the results so far.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investment, and doing what we should to increase the value of your shares.","We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash from operations and from future monetization. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and appreciate your continued support. Pat?","Patrick Kane","Thanks, Dave. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Laura, could you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  (Operator instructions).  Our first question is from Neal Dingmann of Suntrust.  Go head please.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning, guys.  Dave, I just wanted to \u2013 if you could quick comment, obviously, on the new frac design that you\u2019ve talked a lot about and have seen quite incremental results.  You know, again, with what\u2019s going on with gas prices, you know, does that cause you to give pause to that or does it actually cause you to increase?  I just wanted sort of comments around that and if you\u2019re going to continue to ramp that up.","Dave Porges","I\u2019ll let Steve comment mainly on it, but we do focus, and we have focused all along on the extent to which we\u2019re getting increases in EURs versus just the rest of acceleration.  So you can see form the numbers, a lot of it is \u2013 our results that we\u2019re getting from increased EUR, so it\u2019s really just a more efficient way to spend.  I mean, in theory, if you could spend the same amount of money, but have the \u2013 come from and have the same volume come from fewer wells, you would have a lot of efficiencies in other aspects of the business.  A lot of that is what we\u2019re seeing.","We certainly understand that this is not a timeframe in which you would seek acceleration for its own sake, but we do take that into account when we\u2019re looking at the projected return.  Steve, I\u2019ll let you \u2013 would you like to add anything?","Steven Schlotterbeck","I think the only thing I would add is, you\u2019ll notice that 50% of the wells we intend to use that technique on in 2012 are in our \u2013 what we call our Rogersville area in Green County where as we get more data, our confidence level continues to rise that we are actually seeing quite a \u2013 a fairly significant increase in ultimate recovery.","Our number, even at the current stripe prices, show the returns on that incremental capital to be in excess of the base return on our Marcellus drilling.  So I think even exceptionally low prices on half of those wells, it makes excellent sense.","The other half, or still, I guess I would call them experiments, but based on what we\u2019ve seen in Rogersville where we have the most data, we feel like those experiments are worthwhile and they\u2019re targeted in areas that, based on the geology, we expect good economic returns, but we need to gather more data to be sure.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","And Steve, your focus on the Rogersville area, is it more because of the continuity of the play or is it because of the particular formations of this?  I mean, what kind of has you focused on this area?","Steven Schlotterbeck","Well, one, the initial results we got were very encouraging, so that obviously attracted our attention.  But I think the reason that it\u2019s a clear winner is the brittleness of the rock is pretty high there.  So higher silica content in the rock there than we have other places and that seems to be a key factor in having this technique increase recovery.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay.  And David, for you \u2013 Dave or Steve as far as just a quick comment on services out there, we continue to see more kind of an exodus from some of the gas plays, the oil plays in this one and how that factors into kind of what your service forecasts are for the remainder of year?","Dave Porges","Well, on the fracturing side, which is the, you know the build of the spend on a well, our prices are pretty fixed for 2012, so I can\u2019t tell you we\u2019re going to benefit in the short term from any softening in the market.","On the rig side, we do have a couple new rigs coming into the fleet in the next couple of months that have lower average day rates than what we\u2019re currently spending, so we\u2019ll see a little bit of an improvement there.","Steven Schlotterbeck","And generally speaking, we are very aware that they\u2019re finally, finally the leverage is shifting back to the producer community from the service community.  You know, this decline has been really [inaudible], but the steep decline has only occurred over the course of the last six to eight weeks.  So we are very focused on getting more efficiencies and lower cost on that front.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Sure.","Steven Schlotterbeck","I can\u2019t give you specific numbers on it right now.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay.  Very good.  And then the last one, if I could, it looked like, you know, the reallocation of the capital and the CapEx, you know, you did mentioned, you know, pulling back a little bit on the upstream side, but it looks like kind of going forward on the midstream.  Do you still see, you know, around MLP and just, I guess I would say the midstream in general, the same opportunities as far as besides [inaudible], just continue to build out the midstream enabled to have the benefits around controlling your midstream and that\u2019s kind of why we didn\u2019t see any pullback on that side per se?","Dave Porges","Absolutely.  Even though there\u2019s been a lot of talk about pulling back, even with some of the discussions from a variety of others about the Marcellus, and you know, and moving some of their activities away from Marcellus, et cetera, all we\u2019re talking about for the Marcellus at this point seems to be the rate of growth.  It is clearly, I'm mean, what we see and what others who participate here see, is it is the most economic natural gas play in the country  and continues to be economic at these prices, therefore it continues to need midstream.","So even though there are cash flow issues when prices drop that we all have to be focused on, the economic attractiveness of the midstream continues to be there.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey","I absolutely agree with you, Dave.  Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Anne Cameron of BNP Paribas.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Hi, good morning.  Just a question on your midstream.  Is there anything like, now that you\u2019re playing [inaudible] this quarter, is there anything before or after that point until you do an IPO that prevents you from receiving bids on that from a third party?","David Porges","No, there is nothing about that that prevents us from receiving bids, having conversations, et cetera.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay, and are you still talking to any potential bidders or partners?","David Porges","I'm not sure that I want to comment on that, if you don\u2019t mind.  We\u2019re certainly \u2013 we remain open-minded.  Maybe I can leave it like that.  We remain open-minded and \u2013 just so you know, the only time a company gets committed on an MLP is \u2013 it\u2019s not with the first filing of S1, right, it\u2019s when you ultimately finalize the entity.  So even a filing of an S1 would not change the things that I\u2019ve just said about the corporation business, et cetera.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay, thank you.  That\u2019s helpful.  And then just a question around your West Virginia liquids production.  The plant that Mark West is building in Logansport, like that is going to increase your liquids yield on your Marcellus production.  So how much of your current NGL volumes are actually coming from West Virgina and what\u2019s that\u2019s going to do to them?","David Porges","Randy?","Randall Crawford","Yeah, most of our liquids production that comes out of the heron play that we\u2019re currently \u2013 as we mentioned, we have a JT skid that we process in Dodgeridge County that provides a 0.5 gallons per Mcf that is produced.  And when our plant comes on, that will increase to 2 \u00bd gallons per volume produced in the wet area.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay, thanks.  That\u2019s July, correct?","David Porges","Yes, that\u2019s more of the \u2013 right, that is a mid-year thing, so you will see a \u2013 we would expect you would see a big jump up in our liquids numbers once that plant comes on line.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay, super.  Thank you very much.","Operator","And the next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, thanks, good morning.","David Porges","Good morning.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I guess, you know, Dave, can I ask you, you know, what would it take for you guys to drop a rig in the Marcellus?  How I guess, bad does gas have to be for you guys to make that decision?","Dave Porges","I don\u2019t know.  That\u2019s \u2013 you know, we tested it against the current prices and by current, I actually mean what we decided was the prudent thing to do was to test it against the lows that we hit last week.  And of course, it could \u2013 clearly, it could test those lows again.  It still makes a fair amount of sense to continue with our approach in the Marcellus.","We keep challenging ourselves on all of this stuff when the environment changes and I guess it\u2019s maybe \u2013 maybe the safest thing I could say, and most accurate thing I could say, Scott, is that so far what we\u2019ve seen wouldn\u2019t cause us to make those alterations and drop a rig.","So that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, certainly, you can imagine probably, you know, at this point, who wouldn\u2019t be able to pick out a number and say here, what if gas prices went to, I don\u2019t know, what if gas prices went to zero and stayed that way forever.  How much would you like to drill?  Obviously, then you wouldn\u2019t.  But within reason, we don\u2019t see that being something that we\u2019re concerned about.  We will look at the cash flows, obviously.  I guess that would be the thing that would cause us to change something if we thought because of prices that cash flows were drying up enough that we had to make some other form of move and then we\u2019d take a look at the rest of the operations to see what other forms of move was required.","But as it is, I think we described with the heron, that saves us enough so that it more than makes up for the cash flow reduction that we saw even at last weeks\u2019 lows.","So it would certainly have to go below last week\u2019s lows for us to be worried about the cash flow.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, so the way \u2013 so you know, if I, you know, obviously things are moving quick and fast and some operators have made some deeper cuts.  At this point, you\u2019ve obviously made a decision in the heron, but throwing numbers out there, if gas was at $3, $3.50 on average through the end of 2013, it comes down to not necessarily a Marcellus economic question but it\u2019s more of, you know, what your cash flow capabilities are and funding for that.  Is that a far way to view it?","David Porges","Right.  That\u2019s exactly right, which means these other things we\u2019re talking about with regard to midstream monetization then factor into this heavily as well.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, understood.  A question on the production during the quarter.  I think you mentioned the exit rate was like 580 and I think your average during the quarter was 576.  It looks like you may have had a little bit of a backlog of wells to be brought on.  Is there a bit of a backlog there right now that \u2013 to be working through in the first part of this year?","David Porges","There is a bit of a backlog.  If you look at our earnings release, you\u2019ll see we have a larger number of frac stages complete but not online than we typically have.  The bulk of that increase is in our we area of the Marcellus where we\u2019re waiting for the Mark West plant to be operational.","Normally, we probably would not have fracked those wells yet given that that won\u2019t be online for a few more months, but because of the West Virginia regulations regarding reclamation of pits, we needed to go ahead and frac those so we could reclaim the pits at the proper times.  That\u2019s a temporary influence and it means we\u2019ll have a lot of liquid-rich gas ready to go when the plant\u2019s online.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, got it.  Lastly, looking at your reserves, you know, obviously the adjustment, the heron and CMB adjusted that number downward, but you know, just kind of stepping back and looking at it, it seems like your reserve additions, you were a bit light relative to prior years considering that your CapEx spend is, you know, was at at least those levels.  Can you give a little color on that?","Steven Schlotterbeck","That\u2019s mostly a function of where we decided to drill.  The bulk of our drilling was focused in areas where we already had lot of proved reserves on the books, so there wasn\u2019t a lot of \u2013 we weren\u2019t really out in to new areas where there\u2019s a lot of room to add new crude reserves.  Combined with the fact, if you look at the prior couple years, we had added large amounts of crude reserves.  I think it was just sort of the nature of the beast given where we decided to drill because when we decide to drill, we focus on where we can get the best returns and really don\u2019t factor in what the reserve addition impact is going to be.  This year, as result, it \u2013 we had lower additions.","David Porges","We never manager, at least as long as I\u2019ve been here, we have not managed to a reserve number.  We haven\u2019t tried to adopt wells.  One reason \u2013 coming up with a development plan, we have not tailored it to try to \u2013 with offsets in mind, et cetera, to create a particular growth pattern to the reserves.  We come up with the most economic development plan and then we let the reserves fall out the way they do.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, understood.","David Porges","Obviously then, when you\u2019re focusing on drilling in more concentrated area, you\u2019re going to tend to get less reserve ads.  When you\u2019re having more step outs, you\u2019re going to tend to get more reserve ads.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay.  Understood.  I appreciate that.  Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Gil Yang of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good morning, everyone.  I just wanted to follow up on this issue of the well backlog and talk about implications.  Are there any risk, or what do you think is the risk of having these wells fracked and \u2013 because normally they\u2019re just sitting there from the frac load in the well, or what\u2019s going on with those well?","David Porges","A lot of times we\u2019ll flow them back to clean up the bulk of the water and then shut them in.  Sometimes we\u2019ll leave the full load in.  If your questions about a concern of reservoir damage, I guess I\u2019d refer back \u2013 I think we talked about this a few years ago.  For a time there, we actually were thinking that it might be beneficial to leave that load in based on some results we had seen.  We\u2019ve backed off on that, but what I can say is, we have never seen any negative impact of keeping the frac load in the well for extended periods of time.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.","David Porges","It just doesn\u2019t seem to damage as the Marcellus wells.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.  Do you have any rules for how much volume you expect to get out of each stage?","David Porges","Well, that varies by area.  I\u2019d probably refer you to our type-curve information in the \u2013 on our website and you\u2019ll be able to calculate by area what that is.","Steven Schlotterbeck","The tight curves are based on a 5,300 foot well, so you can ratio that for different lengths.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Now, was the buildup in the backlog in any way related to your willingness to sell the excess pipeline capacity?","David Porges","No.  Not at all.  It\u2019s just that when you enter into those kinds of agreements, you\u2019re entering into long-term agreements and you\u2019re kind of forecasting what you\u2019re going to need several years out.  As you kind of grow into it, the odds are you\u2019re going to have excess capacity in the early years.  So we knew that going in.","Frankly, when we looked at that particular line, the one that we\u2019ve been talking about having made some money on at the very tail end of 2011, the Elpaso 300 line, we also felt more comfortable making that commitment because we have a sense that in the early days there was probably going to be a little bit of money to be made on that anyway.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, so given that you were\u2026","David Porges","We do plan on growing into that capacity though, just so you know.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.  Can you give us an idea when you\u2019ll grow into the capacity?","David Porges","Over the next \u2013 well, actually, I\u2019m not sure if we have released this before, but how far out do some of the contracts \u2013 what\u2019s the longest term of the contracts where we \u2013 that we sold down to other people?  We didn\u2019t go \u2013 we did no more than two years and one for three years, small levels.  So no, we intent to grow into that over that period of time.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, so the \u2013 in effect, the transportation subsidy if you will, from selling the \u2013 at a higher price than you paid for it will last \u2013 will last over the next two or three years and will\u2026","David Porges","No, the potential is there.  Obviously, just following the basis markets, you would assume it will tend to be higher in the winter than it will be in the summer and the \u2013 we\u2019ve kind of layered those contracts in so that, as Randy said, there\u2019s one that goes out for three years and then there\u2019s another at \u2013 that goes to two.  So \u2013 and then there\u2019s others that are shorter term than that to the point of monthly and even daily.","So it gradually goes away over the course of the next two to three years.","Philip Conti","This is Phil Conti.  That\u2019s why I tried to guide you to the \u2013 the $0.12 that I said add back to the run rate for the fourth quarter is the part that\u2019s not subject to long-term deals.  That we\u2019ll either do better than that or worse depending on what the market is like, call it next winter.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Right, so in a sense, it should go from the current number, $0.29 up to $0.41 over the next two or three years, right?","Philip Conti","You should use $0.41 right now.  We have, as I said, some of it is under contract.  We bake that into that calculation and we\u2019re just telling you that depending on what the market\u2019s like when we go to sell that capacity next winter; it could be more or less than that $0.12 impact.  We think $0.12 is a good number for you to run with so add $0.12 to the $0.29.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Right, okay.","Philip Conti","We\u2019ll continue to quantify how much was from the resale each quarter.","David Porges","And we\u2019ll try to come up with a way to be transparent on this stuff as we can because the reality is, as we continue to layer in other transport contracts, they\u2019re going to have the same feature where you layer something into the long-term, you\u2019re not going to be using all of it in the early years because obviously, the \u2013 unless you can guess perfectly correctly, which I think everyone in our industry has demonstrated that we cannot do, I think we join other industries in that inability.  But you have to choose on the two little capacity or probably error a little bit on the side of having more capacity.  And you\u2019ll wind up with a little bit more, so it means we\u2019re probably going to have more of this excess as we enter into other contracts, but that\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s going to be worth more than what we\u2019re paying.  When we enter into it, assuming that we\u2019ll be able to cover the cost, but not profit from it.  It just happens that there\u2019s a lack of capacity going into some of the Northeastern cities right now.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Right. And just a last question.  I missed the number, how much liquid volume do you expect to come on when the JT skid comes online?","David Porges","Well, I mentioned the 2 \u00bd gallons.  We hauld 120 million a day of capacity into that plant going into the summer.  And so again, that number also does not include methane, so that\u2019s\u2026","Steven Schlotterbeck","And that\u2019s not the JT.  You asked from the JT skids. We use the JT skids to get the wet gas down to pipeline specs routinely.  So the increase that Randy\u2019s talking about is actually when we don\u2019t have to use those JT skids there anymore because we\u2019re going to through that Mark West plant.","Gil Yang \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.  Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Joseph Allman of JP Morgan.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you.  Good morning, everybody.  Just a couple questions.  One, the base decline for our heron production, what would you estimate your base decline is?","David Porges","Well, we gave the 6 Bcf decline next year from this year\u2019s run rate and then another little bit over 3 for the  year after that.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Got you.  And then on the drop in the CBM possibles, what\u2019s the reason for that drop?","David Porges","I think some of that was economics driven.  Some of our CMB drilling at these really low gas prices, it was hard to even keep those in the possible category.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, anything performance related or\u2026","David Porges","No, I mean, we haven\u2019t drilled in that field for a while, so there is no new production information.  And in our PDPs, there was no revision to those.","Steven Schlotterbeck","The performance there is, at these prices, is mediocre.  It\u2019s just not any worse than it was a year ago, or two years ago, or five years ago.  It\u2019s not that, it\u2019s that in this price environment, it\u2019s a hard time competing against Marcellus gas and associated gas.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Got you.  And then in terms of your booking per well in the Marcellus, you know, in your release, you indicated that you\u2019re PUD you booked at 6.3 B\u2019s and that appears higher than year-end 2010 because I think in Pennsylvania you booked 6.3 B\u2019s but in West Virginia you 4.7.  So it appears that you increased the per-well URs assuming shorter laterals actually.  So could you just clarify that and then this year you\u2019ve booked the crude developed at 5.7 and how does that number compared to the year before?","David Porges","Well, I think to your first question, two factors came into play.  One was improving well performance and the other is mix.  We had higher percentage of PUDs in our very best area this year than we had last year. Those two factors came into play.","Could you repeat the second part of your question?","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Just for the PRU developed, you booked your PRU developed at 5.7 Bcfe per well.  What\u2019s the comparable number in 2010?","David Porges","4 \u00bd feet per well last year.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","That\u2019s helpful.  So in terms of the new frac design, how many wells have you drilled so far using that new frac design?","David Porges","I believe it\u2019s 27, plus or minus a couple.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay.  And then in terms of someone asked the services question, are you having any issues or any concerns about just the logistics, you know, getting sand or any other materials?","David Porges","No.  No problems at all.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","And then just on the comment on the Midstream, you know, you guys made a conscious decision to not sell it out right.  I\u2019m assuming just the openness that you expressed is really just, if you just get a really, really great deal, right?","David Porges","I have a feeling actually that that had to with the other alternative that\u2019s long been on the table, which is a joint venture.  But you\u2019re right, we\u2019re open \u2013 look, we\u2019re in business to create value and so across the board, anything that will create value to the shareholders is something we\u2019re open to.  But the nature of the discussions that are going on in the past about the MLP were really more along the lines of various forms of joint ventures.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Right, but I guess the other question I think was, you know, if I\u2019m not mistaken, was are you open to just selling it out right?  You said, you\u2019re open.","David Porges","We\u2019re open to anything.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Right, okay.","David Porges","The question for us is where do we get the most value for the shareholder.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Right, but you\u2019ve already gone through that who thinking process right, so \u2026","David Porges","We have, but if you\u2019re trying to give a hypothetical of somebody coming in with whatever number we think if a value and they\u2019re adding a zero, well, then that changes our view.  I mean, you can answer yes, no when it\u2019s value because that\u2019s all in the eye of the beholder and we can\u2019t predict whether us saying we\u2019ll file an S1 or actually filing an S1 will alter the way other folks will view it.  I mean, we\u2019re very aware, you look out in the market \u2013 you don\u2019t have to look very far to find folks who announce the transaction and then that focuses the mind of somebody else and they react to it by putting a different \u2013 kind of sharpening their pencil.  That stuff happens and we don\u2019t want to \u2013 we don\u2019t want to stick our head in the sand and pretend it couldn\u2019t happen here.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Sure, but there\u2019s no change in your thinking versus your last, you know, disclosure about \u2013 okay.","David Porges","That\u2019s exactly correct.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","And you know, and control of the assets, I mean, the ability for you to be able to grow your Marcellus at the pace that you want hinges on having some control of this?","David Porges","It has value to us.  I don\u2019t know if I want to say hinges on because that kind of turns it into a black or white.  It has value to us.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Got you.  Okay.  And then lastly, just what prices are you using for your CapEx budget for 2012?","David Porges","Well, what we tested it at, all the numbers that we gave you were based on a $3 or a little below $3 stripe for \u201812.","Philip Conti","For the cash flow. The budget was based on the cost per well and the number of wells.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Got you.  That\u2019s what I mean.  Okay.  Very helpful.  Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Hi.  Can you discuss the percent of your gas stream that is made up by methane and the potential upside from eventual industry ethane solution in light of Range\u2019s announcement this morning that they secured a $0.145 per gallon transport cost on EPD\u2019s [inaudible] Express Line to [inaudible] connections?","David Porges","Yes.  We announced what the percentage is of liquids that would double essentially with the take of ethane.  As we mentioned before, the plant that will be coming online in Northern West Virginia will provide EQT the opportunity to extract ethane, which would increase the amount of gallons from 2 \u00bd to 5.","We have the flexibility to make that decision economically and as we look out and make that decision, if it is in EQT\u2019s best interest to extra ethane from the price that we will receive, then we\u2019ll have the ability to do that.  And if we are in a position to sell it as methane as we today and blend it, if that\u2019s in the economic best interest, then we\u2019ll do that as well.","And we\u2019re glad that pipelines are being built to move ethane.  That\u2019s good, but realistically, if you look at the macro situation for ethane supply demand in the Marcellus, and you read through the specifics of any kind of the agreements that people enter into, you come up with ways to, you extract methane \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, you extract ethane from the methane stream mainly because you have to to get down to pipelines.  It doesn\u2019t really create a lot of value the way propane and butane, et cetera do.  It\u2019s, you know, if you can, as Randy said, if the pipelines are there and you can enter into transactions where you can have a little bit of money, that\u2019s great, but the mindset we still thing \u2013 we still think the prudent mindset with ethane is to assume that you extract it when you have to to meet pipeline specs.  And if you can make a few bucks on top of that, well, then that\u2019s obviously great.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","But isn\u2019t that, given today\u2019s pricing with $0.14, $0.15 per gallon transport costs, isn\u2019t that a premium to methane gas?","David Porges","Well, first of all, those things, those pipes will be \u2013 start netting back that and fuel and loss, it\u2019s a pretty close call.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Okay, so you think that at this point, there\u2019s marginal uplift potential from finding end markets for the ethane?","David Porges","Yes, you have to enter into long-term term commitments.  The only thing firm about that kind of pipeline deal \u2013 and it\u2019s the same with our gas price, you know, with the EL Paso expansion that we signed up, it\u2019s the same thing.  The only thing that\u2019s certain is that you\u2019ve got to write them checks.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Right.","David Porges","And if you\u2019re in a position where that you need to extract ethane to meet the pipeline specs, then economics may not drive that decision.  EQT\u2019s in a position right now to make that decision based on the economics.","Randall Crawford ","Look, wetter gas, in this market, is better than dryer gas, but for the most part, for all of us here, half of the C2 and above, roughly speaking is C2.  So if you want to be able to extract the value form the C3 and above, you have to be able to do something with the C2.  So you know, so I think net-net, it\u2019s attractive if you have wet enough gas to make \u2013 you just want to make sure you can let the gas flow.  And to let the gas flow, it has to \u2013 you have to have little enough ethane in it that you can meet pipeline specs.  So in that context, the all-in economics can work very well, but the all-in economics don\u2019t work because of the specifics of the ethane deal, that\u2019s just a means to an end.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Range has talked about the possibility of actually exporting from the East Coast within two to three years to Europe.  If there was a closer export opportunity to global markets, would that change your outlook on the incremental value of ethane?","Randall Crawford","Absolutely.  If the value is there, we\u2019re prepared to pursue it.  It\u2019s just that that\u2019s still not the driving force behind even the wet gas development.  It\u2019s the C3s and above that\u2019s the driving force.  But yeah, absolutely.  If there\u2019s the opportunity to make material uplift, then we certainly would pursue that.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Okay. Thank you very much for the discussion.","Operator","Our next question is from Ray Deacon from Brean Murray, Carret & Co.","Ray Deacon \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Co. ","Yes, hi.  I had a question for Phil.  I was wondering, could you just talk about your borrowing base in light of the fact that a number of companies have talked about downward revisions to their borrowing lines.  My understanding is you have a corporate based facility, right, so there\u2019s probably\u2026","Philip Conti","Yes, there\u2019s not borrowing base at all.  It\u2019s $1.5 billion without a borrowing base calculation ever done during the life of that facility.  It matures in 2014, so I think November 2014.","Ray Deacon \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Co. ","Got it.  And what\u2019s likely to happen with the IPO in the Midstream business?  Does part of that go with the Midstream or what\u2019s\u2026","Philip Conti","You\u2019re just trying to get us in trouble with the SEC, Ray.  I know you.","Ray Deacon \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Co. ","Okay, you can\u2019t \u2013 and just in terms of the \u2013 to clarify the economics on the program in 2012, when you say you stress tested down to $3 strip, do you include the impact of the 50% that\u2019s hedged in that or no?","Philip Conti","Actually, I\u2019m happy to make a philosophical point.  When we look at the going economics of the program, obviously we take the hedges into account.  But when we\u2019re making marginal decisions, on the margin, every MMBTU of every incremental or detrimental MMBTU of natural gas should be priced at the market.  And I think that extends even if you were fully hedged and you dropped, you can always tear up the contract.  You can cancel the contract.  Nobody has to know that the production\u2019s there.  The accountants might have an issue with it.  But you can still collect the money on a hedge even if you were fully hedged and decided to cut production.","So the right way to make marginal decisions is based on the strip.  No matter how \u2013 what your hedge percentage is or isn\u2019t, it happens, of course that the Huron decision on a piece of paper increases the percent hedge that we\u2019ve got just because it takes the denominator down.  But we make these decisions on what we should do on the margin by looking at the market.","Ray Deacon \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Co. ","Okay.  Got it, makes sense.  And two quick questions for Randy.  I was wondering, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion that a lot of the major trunk lines that run through the Marcellus are going to fill up this year and given the cutbacks that people are announced, could you just talk about kind of your \u2013 some of your long-term plans and how the backhaul might play in to that as an asset I guess?","Randall Crawford","As you know, EQT has always been proactive to be to procure capacity and one, ensure flow assurance and number two, to access markets downstream and have liquidity and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that with our capacity on Tennessee.  Going forward, I mean, as the development continues, it will continue that strategy.  We still continue to see significant drilling and the need for capacity and that\u2019s been our strategy going forward.","Ray Deacon \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Co. ","Got it.  Okay.  I mean, you don\u2019t see [inaudible]?","Randall Crawford","There will always be certain bottlenecks.  Now with respect to the backhaul, again, we look at accessing a variety of markets.  Obviously, the most attractive markets in the Northeast, but the backhaul, again, with the possibility of exporting LNG and accessing more meters, we continue to look at utilizing our portfolio to access a variety of markets and that does include the backhauls into the Gulf Coast and forward hauls into the Northeast.  So we look at a variety of options that could give EQT one flow assurance into realize the best price for our product.","Initially, our approach for the LNG export is the same as it is on an earlier participant that asked about ethane export.  We\u2019re not prepared to enter into that type of arrangement right now, but we like the fact that the backhaul gives us the opportunity to do so if we wind up deciding in the future that it is, in fact an attractive thing to do.","Ray Deacon \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Co. ","Got it.  Great.  Thanks.  And I was just curious with that JT skid, I mean, is there \u2013 would you be able to sell the two of those or is there much value there?  Would you continue to use them somewhere else?","Randall Crawford","Well, we would use those somewhere else.  As we continue to grow into our \u2013 in order to meet pipeline specs, we\u2019ll  have the flexibility omove those.","Ray Deacon \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Co. ","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have a question from Steven Richardson of Deutsche Bank.","Steven Richardson -  Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning.  A quick question on just a clarification.  Following up on the discussion of marking the strip to where it was last week and thinking about cash flow for this year, as you think about 13, can you just clarify what, you know how you think about this term living within our means and what that could mean?  Is the program here \u2013 is the plan here to try to keep this program flat year over year or how do you think about that in the light of a $3 thereabouts strip next year?","Dave Porges","Well, practically, it means cash flows from operations plus monetization of probably Midstream assets, though really, anything is open to \u2013 I don\u2019t mean to sound \u2013 make it trite, but everything if for sale at a price  and to the extent that these other two find some of our assets more interesting to them then they are to right now, you know, that becomes a monetization opportunity.  But I think practically, we\u2019d look at 2013 and say it\u2019s operating cash flow plus those sorts of monetization.  And the stuff that\u2019s nearer term, of course, is a continuation of some form of Midstream optimization.  Of course, we chatted about what some of the ways that that would happen would be.","Steven Richardson -  Deutsche Bank","Right, okay.  Thank you.  And so as you think about \u2013 I guess the other question was a clarification on the reduction of activity in the Huron.  You mentioned that there\u2019s \u2013 well completions are going on this year.  Is there any other penalties or anything else in terms of shutting down that business that\u2019s included in that capital number for 2012?","Philip Conti","No.  Actually, the only missing \u2013 you know, we\u2019re chatting about \u2013 before the cal began, so we\u2019ll share it with the rest of you, if you\u2019re doing the math on the number of wells that we\u2019re not doing \u2013 we\u2019re not going to drill that were originally in the plan, you would have to factor in that some of the wells that gets spud would have, but no longer will.  But in the plan we\u2019ve gotten spud late in 2012, they would have had a fair amount of their CapEx occurring in 2013.  So you\u2019ve got the 130 \u2013 just one decision causes a reduction in CapEx in 2012 of $135 million, which we stated and roughly, let\u2019s say $25 million in 2013 from those 2012 wells.  I mean, you spud the well but you would have still had more work to do fracking at such that would have bleed into 2013.","Steven Richardson -  Deutsche Bank","Got it.  But you were \u2013 the previous plan, were you already tending down in terms of activity so you would have held fewer wells waiting on completion at year end \u201912 versus what you held in \u201911?","Randall Crawford","No, because actually the \u201912 plan, the beginning \u201912 plan was pretty similar to the \u201911 plan.  We had \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt that we trended down, but the \u201912 plan actually reflected a plateauing versus \u201911.","Steven Richardson -  Deutsche Bank","Got it.","Randall Crawford","And the Huron program has a very short lag for SPUD to TIL, so we don\u2019t generate a large backlog in the Huron play.","Steven Richardson -  Deutsche Bank","Great.  Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.  I would like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Kane for any closing remarks.","Patrick Kane","Yes, thank you, everybody for participating and as I mentioned earlier, the call will be available for seven days for replay.

The telephone number for the replay is 719-457-0820 with a confirmation code of 2277056. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website.","We remind you that results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, are consolidated in EQT\u2019s results. There was a separate press release issued by EQM this morning and there\u2019s a separate conference call at 11:30 AM today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is 913-312-9034.","In just a moment, Phil will summarize EQT\u2019s results; next, Steve will summarize the capital budget revisions; and finally, Dave will provide an update on two projects. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy and Steve will be available to answer your questions.","I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today\u2019s press release and under Risk Factors in EQT\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the SEC and available on our website.","Today\u2019s call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning\u2019s press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip Conti","Thanks, Pat. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.08, which represents a 20% decrease from adjusted EPS in the first quarter 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by about 16% to $386 million for the quarter.","We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record gathering volumes at Midstream. A high level story for the first quarter was strong volume growth more than offset by lower realized prices. Our pricing was significantly below last year. Our average differential was better than expected, offsetting some of the impact of lower prices. This came primarily as a result of moving gas to higher priced Northeast markets in the first quarter 2015.","As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners\u2019 results are consolidated in EQT Corporation\u2019s results, and EQT recorded $47.7 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests or $0.31 per diluted share in the first quarter 2015, as compared to $18.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the first quarter 2014. This increase also had an impact on the effective tax rate in the quarter, which was around 20%, and they have been lower than some of you expected. That is a function of both the increasing noncontrolling interest portion of EQM, which is not tax affected, as well as Production income, which is tax affected being a smaller piece of the overall pie versus last year as a result of lower commodity prices.","Other than that, the first quarter was very straightforward and I will keep my remarks fairly brief. The story in the quarter at EQT Production continues to be growth in sales of produced natural gas. Production sales growth in the recently completed quarter was 37% higher than the first quarter of 2014. NGL volumes were also higher, 71% higher than last year, accounting for 9% of our total volumes.","However, as I mentioned, the lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The realized price at EQT Production was $2.77 per Mcf equivalent compared to $4.50 per Mcf equivalent last year. And you will find the detailed components of the price differences in the tables in this morning\u2019s press release.","Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $316.4 million or $81.2 million higher quarter-over-quarter. In March, we decided to suspend drilling in the Permian Basin as projected economics continued to deteriorate. There are several expenses in the first quarter related to that decision as well as to the lower commodity prices in general.","In SG&A, we recognized $11 million of expenses related to discontinued drilling, including rig termination costs, a write-down of some well casing inventory and operating well impairments. Exploration expense was also higher and includes $11 million of non-cash lease impairments.","Shifting back to operating results, higher DD&A expense accounted for $40 million of the increase in total operating expenses and was driven by volume growth, but partially offset by a lower average depletion rate in 2015. Transportation and processing expenses were $15 million higher than last year and you should note that these expenses were previously presented as revenue deductions in EQT Production\u2019s results. And as you would expect, reported EQT Production revenues are higher as well to reflect that new presentation. LOE, including production taxes, was essentially flat compared to last year.","Moving on to the Midstream business, operating income here was up 56%. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission revenue. Gathering net operating revenues increased by 44% to $129 million, as gathering volumes increased by about 47%.","Transmission net revenues increased by $20 million or 38% as additional firm capacity was added over the past year, mostly in the second quarter 2014. Storage, marketing and other net operating revenues were down slightly about $1.4 million lower in the first quarter.","Total operating expenses at Midstream were $11 million higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of continuing growth in our Midstream business. On a per-unit basis, however, gathering and compression expense was down 31% as a result of volumes growing much faster than expected.","Just a brief note on liquidity, EQT currently has $1.6 billion of cash on hand, not including EQM, and full availability under EQT\u2019s $1.5 billion credit facility. So we remain in a great liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future. Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow adjusted to exclude the noncontrolling interest portion of EQM\u2019s cash flow is $900 million.","With that, I will turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck.","Steven Schlotterbeck","Thank you, Phil. As you read in today\u2019s press release, we are lowering our 2015 CapEx forecast by $150 million to reflect the midpoint of our negotiated service cost reductions that we published in our March analyst presentation. Based on these reduced service costs, we expect our average cost per well to be between 10% and 15% less than last year. If weak commodity prices persist, we believe there could be more opportunities to cut costs, but for now, we think 10% to 15% is a reasonable expectation.","Also in response to weak oil prices, we\u2019ve decided to suspend drilling in the Permian Basin which was already reduced to drilling the minimum number of wells to hold certain leases. As a result, we will lose our development rights to approximately 700 Upper Wolfcamp acres. It\u2019s always a tough decision to let leases expire, but we think in this environment, that\u2019s a prudent economic decision.","Moving on to our dry gas Utica well, as you know, we spud this Greene County well in November. During the drilling of the curve, we encountered higher than expected reservoir pressures, and based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our mud weight, which required a larger rig. We deployed the larger rig in March and completed the drilling of the well with a final lateral length of 3,300 feet. We\u2019re currently running some reservoir tests and expect to begin fracing in early June.","Despite this timing setback, we continue to be excited and optimistic about the dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage. Upon completion of the Greene County well, we plan to drill a deep Utica well in Wetzel County, West Virginia later this year. Since we still do not have any results from our first well, we will not speculate about those results, but we will provide you with updates as we learn more.","I\u2019d now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments.","David Porges","Thank you, Steve. Given the straightforward results for the quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to an update on two previously announced projects.","Let\u2019s cover the Master Limited Partnership first, the new one. As we discussed in February, we decided to take public a new vehicle that will own all of EQT\u2019s interests in EQT Midstream Partners or EQM. This means the new vehicle, whose New York Stock Exchange symbol is expected to be EQGP, will own EQT\u2019s general partner or GP interest, including the incentive distribution rights, and it will also own the 22 million EQM limited partner units owned by EQT.","On February 12, we filed the initial draft S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We received comments from the SEC on the draft and incorporated them into a revised S-1, which was filed on April 1. This is an iterative process of review by the SEC and response by us so we cannot accurately predict the timing of a final S-1, but we reiterate our hope to be ready for an initial public offering of EQGP by about midyear.","Now for an update on the Mountain Valley Pipeline or MVP, in the first quarter, MVP announced the addition of WGL Holdings and Vega Energy Partners, a WGL subsidiary, to the joint venture. As we have previously discussed, this project will be built and operated by EQT Midstream Partners. EQM\u2019s ownership interest in the JV is 55%. NextERA owns 35% and WGL and its subsidiaries own 10%.","In addition to their ownership stake, WGL will be a shipper on the pipeline and has also agreed to purchase 500 million cubic feet per day of natural gas priced at Transco station 165. We believe this further validates the demand market\u2019s desire to access the abundant Marcellus and Utica supply resource.","EQT shareholders will benefit in two ways from this project. First, it will provide EQT Production access to one of the fastest-growing gas consumption markets in the United States. And second, it will provide cash flow growth at the MLP, which adds to the value of our GP and LP interests.","In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We have a very strong balance sheet which will allow us to continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane again.","Patrick Kane","Thank you, Dave. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Danny, can we now open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Steve, for you and the guys, you mentioned obviously for the service costs, I know you took the CapEx down considerably. Could you talk a little bit, it looked also like LOE we was down considerably and then on a go forward, it appears to be \u2013 what are you doing in that category to continue to bring that down so nicely?","Steven Schlotterbeck","I think it\u2019s just more of the same, Neal. Production continues to increase at a much faster pace than the costs required to maintain that production. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in particular I would point to other than just continue trying to manage our water costs as best we can. That\u2019s probably the one area that we focus a lot of attention on and it\u2019s a pretty high cost area relative to the others and is an area that\u2019s continuing to prove how we handle our water will help us continue to keep our unit costs in line.","Neal Dingmann","I know it\u2019s early, obviously, on that Utica well drill, and obviously a bit away from the one you\u2019re going to drill in the west. I\u2019m just wondering, on a bigger scope, Steve, any thoughts on \u2013 because it is so early on the dry Utica, what that could mean as far as allocating capital dollars? At this time, as you see it for at least the next 12 months, the bulk even as I expect as you are about the dry gas, the bulk is still going to be in Marcellus and then, if so, are you continuing to target sort of a concentrated area there or how are you tackling that now?","Steven Schlotterbeck","I think our view there, Neal, is this year will certainly be a year of testing the Utica. So we\u2019ve drilled our first well. The second well will be in Wetzel County. We could potentially drill up to four additional wells this year depending on timing and what we see. But regardless, this year we\u2019ll be testing. I think a good bit of next year we\u2019ll still be gathering data before we\u2019ll be in a position to even make a decision about reallocating capital between Marcellus and Utica.","And I think the driver there will be, regardless of the IPs, which clearly our peers have had some pretty impressive IPs, we\u2019re certainly hopeful we will as well, we need to define what the type curve, the decline curve looks like to really understand the economics. And I think our view is it\u2019ll be a minimum of a year\u2019s worth of actual production data before we\u2019ll have enough comfort to shift any significant amount of capital away from Marcellus into Utica, assuming that indications are that the economics are similar or hopefully better.","Neal Dingmann","One last one, if I could. Probably for Dave, as far as, obviously, after the drop down, Dave, and even prior, you guys have if not the best, one of the best financial positions out there today, certainly in the \u2013 not just the East Coast, but really in the universe out there. Acquisition-wise, I know you guys continue, with Steve and his group, continue to look at everything. Are you open to adding in the East? Would you consider adding another basin? When you look at \u2013 I guess I have two questions around this. Given the financial position, are you more apt to do acquisitions these days? And then secondly, if so, or even if not, would you like to stay in the same basins or would you go somewhere else?","David Porges","I don\u2019t think I would characterize our perspective as being more interested in an acquisition because of our financial situation. We\u2019re executing the transactions we are with the Midstream because we think it\u2019s the best way to create value. It\u2019s the money, as I\u2019ve said multiple times, is not burning a hole in our pocket.","With that said, we do recognize that this could be an opportunity to acquire, and I\u2019d say really in core areas would be the priority if the opportunities presented themselves at values that recognize the depressed commodity price environment. So I think I kind of answered your second question too, which is...","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital.","Scott Hanold","Specifically, could you give us some color on CapEx? Obviously, the number has come down and maybe a little bit of color on where you\u2019ve seen the reductions really come in, was it backdating contracts with a specific service there? And then as a follow on to that, will you be comfortable at any point in time if you do see service costs continue to come down to actually use that money and put it in the ground, or do you just feel comfortable enough just building \u2013 putting the cash balance at this point?","Steven Schlotterbeck","I think the \u2013 because the biggest line item in our drilling costs is pumping services, that\u2019s what really drives that number more than anything. I would say a few of our contracts have been backdated a little bit, but for the most part, most of them have been pulling forward from the time we negotiated the lower costs, so most of that is prospective.","The one line item I will comment on in the opposite direction is our rig cost, our day rates. Most of our rigs are under longer term contracts that don\u2019t expire this year. So we have relatively little leverage in that area. So our lack of leverage is reflected in that 10% to 15% estimate. If soft prices continue into next year and the year after, we\u2019ll be in a position to benefit from lower rig costs, but for now, we\u2019re not.","I think our plan right now regarding redeployment of that capital is to keep it on the balance sheet. We think in this low-price environment and the growth rates we\u2019re expecting, we\u2019re in a pretty good spot and don\u2019t feel compelled just because we\u2019ll have some extra money to run out and spend it just because we have it. So for now, it\u2019ll stay on the balance sheet and we\u2019ll revisit that periodically as commodity prices move.","Scott Hanold","Maybe if I could rephrase the question, what price do you think on the forward curve it would take for incremental capital to be spent to start to become interesting?","David Porges","That\u2019s hard to say. We just really look at the economics. Actually, I would say the one benefit we get though of having the cash on the balance sheet is, unlike what we, infer is the case of the number of our peers, we will obviously have the financial flexibility to revise our programs upward if the economics improve as opposed to if you live in hand to mouth experience where you have to wait until the money starts rolling in. In our case, the money is already there. So really it is just the judgment about the prospective economics. But we really haven\u2019t come up with new sense of a magic price at which we would revise upward. It\u2019s just something that we really look at pretty frequently.","Scott Hanold","Dave, what would you sense your \u2013 with these reduced well costs because of services coming down, service costs coming down, what is the after-tax breakeven price to get a 10% rate of return today on your core acreage?","David Porges","Pat\u2019s already looking to find the right page in the right presentation. And I probably want to refer you to that because we don\u2019t \u2013 as you know, I think, we don\u2019t just look at it as core acreage. We tend to differentiate between Southwestern PA versus Northern West Virginia wet, Northern West Virginia dry, et cetera. Those are the categories we use. Pat, I\u2019m happy for you to [indiscernible].","Patrick Kane","Hanold, I don\u2019t know what the 10% return would be, but if you look at the Southwest PA, which is one of the two core areas, the other is Northern West Virginia wet. Southwest PA at $2.50 realized price would give you an 18% after-tax return. And Southwest \u2013 or Northern West Virginia wet would be 24% at $2.50 realized price. So the returns are still quite good even at today\u2019s prices.","Scott Hanold","Is that today\u2019s service costs that you\u2019re stating me those numbers on?","Patrick Kane","Yes. That includes the service cost reductions.","Operator","From Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company we have Michael Rowe.","Michael Rowe","I just wanted to talk to you real quickly about the production guidance change, understanding it\u2019s only about 1% increase at the midpoint, but has anything changed with respect to completion timing on your 2015 program, or wells performing better than expected? I\u2019m just trying to tie your CapEx reduction in February which was activity-driven with the production guidance increase this morning?","Steven Schlotterbeck","I think for the most part, it\u2019s just driven by \u2013 we have one quarter under our belt, so the range of possible outcomes narrows with the first quarter being ahead of our original guidance. So I think that should be expected to be reflected in raising the lower end of guidance up. So that\u2019s what we did. I think well performance continues to improve. So there\u2019s a little bit of that. But it\u2019s mostly just around certainty having been a quarter of the year in the bag.","Michael Rowe","You had a good NGL realization relative to WTI at about 46%. This looks in line with what you experienced in Q1 of last year. So is it reasonable to assume NGL realization should moderate closer to the low 30s on a percentage basis relative to WTI as we enter Q2 through Q4 of this year?","Steven Schlotterbeck","I don\u2019t know that we have a particular view on that. But when you\u2019re looking at percentages also you do need to be a bit careful to make sure that you\u2019re looking at NGLs the same way. I mean, as you know, generally speaking, when we\u2019re thinking NGLs, we are thinking C3s and above is what we\u2019re actually selling, right? The rest of the ethane, generally speaking, you should assume is being sold as methane. And there are some folks who are selling ethane as ethane. They would obviously have a lower percentage if they\u2019re making the calculation that way. That said I\u2019m not sure that we have a particular forecast, any great insight into what is going on in the NGL market any more than anybody else would have.","Michael Rowe","Maybe one last one, if I can, just we talked a little bit about type well economics and the updated ones that you all have in your March presentation. Can you just remind us what the differentials you have baked into those are? Is that just your outlook on basis differentials at that point in time when you ran the calculation?","Philip Conti","So whenever we show there is IRRs, we are using the local price. So it\u2019s not really taking an assumption of a differential. It\u2019s the local price. So if you\u2019re looking at $2.50 local price, that could be $3.59 minus $1 dollar diff, or $3 and then with minus $0.50.","Operator","Our next question is from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker","Wanted to follow up on the dry gas Utica. I want to make sure I had that lateral length right, so can you just repeat that for us, and given the challenge that you had in the drilling portion, I wonder if that changes your expectations of costs at least for the drilling portion going forward?","Steven Schlotterbeck","The lateral length was 3,300 feet. And I think our expectation is while we did have a lot of challenges, I don\u2019t think it changes our long-term view of the cost other than maybe a little bit on the mud side. So the mud cost will probably be a bit more expensive since we had to use heavier mud than we would have originally thought. I think everything else, over time, there will be a learning curve. It\u2019ll take us probably several wells to get the costs in line with where we think they\u2019ll be long term.","Maybe the one additional color I\u2019ll add that maybe is on the positive side, although right now it\u2019s a theory, not practice, is on the proppant where \u2013 for our first couple of wells we\u2019re going to use ceramic proppant, which is quite a bit more expensive than sand. It looks like it\u2019s going to run about $100,000 per stage or $2.5 million for a typical well to use ceramic versus sand.","Our reservoir engineering at this point is suggesting that it might be possible to use sand in these wells. So that\u2019ll be something we\u2019re testing, probably not in these first two wells, but in subsequent wells. So that\u2019s some positive news from our end in terms of what the long-term development costs for deep Utica will be on our acreage.","Andrew Venker","I\u2019m sorry, just a follow-up to that, was that 3,300 feet the original lateral length you had planned?","Steven Schlotterbeck","We had planned anywhere from 3,000 to 4,500. So our internal discussions were we need 3,000 to get the reservoir test we really want, which is the purpose of this well, we\u2019ll go as far as 4,500. We had room to, but really the guidance to the drilling team was get 3,000, and at that point any hint of a problem and we\u2019re going to call it and TD the well and move on, because really the whole goal of this well is to test the reservoir and we can do that with a 3,300-foot lateral.","Andrew Venker","And so it wasn\u2019t that you had significant drilling issues and that you thought you wouldn\u2019t be able to drill the full lateral length? It was enough to the test the reservoir.","Steven Schlotterbeck","It was. We had a lot of difficulties on this well and the costs were pretty high. And when we got to 3,300 feet, there were some indications that more problems could be developing. And we just didn\u2019t want to take \u2013 once we had the 3,000 feet, we didn\u2019t see any reason to take any additional risk, put the well bore at risk where we might not even be able to complete it, so that\u2019s when we called it at 3,300.","Andrew Venker","Okay. And the last one and then I\u2019ll leave the Utica alone. Was that $2.5 million incremental completion cost baked into your original well cost estimate?","Steven Schlotterbeck","Well, our original one, yes. If you look in our investor presentation, we have a pretty wide range of $12 million to $17 million. The $12 million is closer to what we would hope long-term we could do if we can use sand. And the $17 million is sort of a worst-case scenario with ceramics and accounting for other unknowns. But yes, we did have the $2.5 million in our original thoughts.","Andrew Venker","Okay. And then on the Midstream side, you guys obviously had a big beat on third-party recoveries. Can you give us a sense of what portion was related to selling firm that you didn\u2019t need versus other uplift?","Randall Crawford","Sure. The majority of it was actually moving to higher-priced markets to sell our gas, and a smaller percentage was really on the overall capacity, because, as you know we manage our overall portfolio to maximize our price. And so our commercial team did an excellent job and they make those decisions daily as to whether to move our product or release the capacity to move to another market. But overall, the whole driver is really the realized price for our production.","Operator","From JPMorgan we have Joe Allman.","Joseph Allman","Just a couple income statement questions, I noticed that exploration expense is up. Is that from dry hole expense or G&A or something else?","Philip Conti","It\u2019s not dry hole expense, it\u2019s some lease impairments in the Permian that Steve talked about. A small amount of it is also related to the lease impairment in Ohio Utica.","Joseph Allman","G&A also increased in the Production business, can you talk about that?","Philip Conti","Some of it\u2019s just the natural growth in the Production business, but we laid out several expenses and I mentioned in my comments that were, I guess, you\u2019d call unusual, and we\u2019ve adjusted them out in some of the tables in the release this morning. It was about $13 million of expenses like that related to the rig release in the Permian Basin. We did take a further impairment on Ohio Utica value and then there were some casing that we won\u2019t be able to use. That was in casing and we wrote down as well. So things like that. And that totaled to about $13 million in the SG&A line.","Joseph Allman","Lastly, just in terms of the rig count and the terms of those rigs you mentioned earlier that you\u2019re not getting the leverage of lower service costs fully because of the longer-term rig contract, could you describe the number of rigs and the terms of those contracts?","Steven Schlotterbeck","Typically those contracts were three or four-year contracts. Most of those are one or two years in. I think we have one or two in 2016 that will come up, so those would be the first \u2013 that\u2019s the first opportunity we really have to lower those costs.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in our queue. I\u2019d like to turn things over to our speakers for any closing or additional remarks.","David Porges","Thank you all for participating, and we\u2019ll see you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation."],"8701":["EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 25, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Patrick John Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Philip P.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Patrick Kane, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.","Patrick John Kane","Thanks, Yussaf, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Porges, President and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Conti, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Randy Crawford, Senior Vice President and President of Midstream, Distribution and Commercial; and Steve Schlotterbeck, Senior Vice President and President of Exploration and Production.","This call will be replayed for a 7-day period, beginning at approximately 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time today. The telephone number for the replay is (412) 317-0088 with the confirmation code of 10025410. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website.","To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, are consolidated in EQT's results. There is a separate press release issued by EQM this morning, and there's a separate conference call today at 11:30 a.m., which creates a hard stop for this call at 11:25. If you're interested in the EQM call, the dial-in number is (412) 317-6789, confirmation code 10025420.","In just a moment, Phil will summarize EQT's operational and financial results for the second quarter, which were released this morning, then Dave will provide an update on strategic and operational matters. Following Dave's remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy and Steve will be available to answer your questions.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements related to the future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, filed with the SEC as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which were on file at the SEC as well.","Today's call may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone.","As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2013 earnings of $0.57 per diluted share, a $0.36 per share increase versus the second quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share. Those outstanding financial results were driven by another strong operating quarter at EQT.","Production sales volumes in the quarter were 54% higher than last year, NGL volumes were 52% higher and midstream gathering volumes were up 50%. These very positive 2013 second quarter results were slightly offset by the impact of $16 million in noncash incentive compensation expense that was about $6.7 million higher than last year, as a result of the increase in EQT stock price, improving our share total return relative to a group of industry peers, which is a key driver for our incentive compensation plans.","In addition, exploration expense was $4.3 million higher, as a result of a $5.2 million noncash lease impairment. These 2 variances lowered EPS in the quarter by $0.05 versus last year, but had no impact on operating cash flow.","Operating cash flow in the quarter totaled $317 million or nearly double last year's $166 million of cash flow. As Pat reminded you, EQT Midstream Partners, or EQM, results are consolidated in EQT's results. The impact of the noncontrolling interest is a little more clear on the income statement than it is in the cash flow results.","Net cash provided by operating activities at EQM was $26.1 million in the quarter and included in EQT's consolidated cash flow. However, please do note that not all of that cash flow is available to EQT, as noncontrolling unitholders owned approximately 40% of EQM during the second quarter 2013 and, currently, they hold approximately 55.4% post the recent follow-on offering.","Clearly, top line growth drove the relatively straightforward financial results in the quarter, and I will now briefly summarize those by business units, starting with EQT Production.","Our net Production sales volume continued to grow dramatically. As we mentioned, Production volume was 54% higher, and that growth was driven by a 111% year-over-year increase in sales from our Marcellus Shale play. Prices were also improved with the realized price at EQT Production of $3.30 per MCF equivalent, compared to $2.62 last year, or a 26% increase. At the corporate level, EQT received $4.37 per MCF equivalent, compared to $3.83 received last year.","The average NYMEX gas price for the quarter was $4.09 per MCF, compared to $2.22 last year. Basis was approximately flat with NYMEX both years.","Two items impact the realized price this quarter. First was the ineffectiveness of hedges, totaling about $7.5 million, which reduced our hedge gain in this quarter. Second, was the loss on the resell of unused capacity not under long-term contracts, which totaled $8.3 million in the quarter. We've been adding that number back to adjusted earnings as, initially, we saw noticeable swings from gains to losses quarter-to-quarter, however, this is the fifth quarter in a row where the loss has been relatively stable, so we stopped adding the cost back to earnings beginning this quarter. This shows up in our price reconciliation as third-party gathering and transmission.","Produced NGL volume was 52% higher than last year. And as a reminder, we do not include ethane in this calculation, as it is currently sold mostly as methane.","Total operating expenses at EQT Production were higher quarter-over-quarter, as a result of higher DD&A exploration expense, LOE and production taxes. At the same time, per unit LOE, excluding Production taxes, was down 20% to $0.16 per unit, further improving our cost structure that is already among the best in the industry. SG&A was also down on a unit basis. Those decreases were the result of produced volume growth that vastly outpaced higher costs.","Midstream results. In the quarter, operating income here was up 21% due to the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission evidence. Gathering net revenues increased by $14.9 million, as gathering volumes increased by 50%, somewhat offset by a decrease in the average gathering rate of 19% due to the increase in Marcellus gathered volumes, which are relatively less expensive to gather and, therefore, get charged a lower rate.","As Marcellus production continues to grow as a percentage of our total production mix, the average gathering rate paid by EQT Production and other producers will continue to decline. We expect our fourth quarter 2013 average rate to be $0.75 per MMBtu. However, EQT Midstream margins are expected to continue to be strong.","Midstream transmission net revenues also increased by 81% in the quarter, driven by higher capacity charges and throughput.","Storage, marketing and other net operating revenues was $9.2 million lower in the second quarter. And as I've mentioned several times before, the storage and marketing part of the Midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve, and those have continued to decline.","Given current market conditions, we currently expect full year 2013 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will total approximately $30 million.","Net operating expenses at Midstream were up quarter-over-quarter, however, as in Production, per unit gathering and transmission expense was 32% lower, driven by the tremendous volume growth.","Just a couple quick notes on the balance sheet. We closed the quarter with approximately $55 million in short-term debt. But subsequent to quarter end, we received $508 million in cash, as well as some additional LP and GP units from the sale of Sunrise Pipeline to EQT Midstream Partners. Dave will go into a little bit more detail in that in a minute, but that gave us a current cash balance of approximately $400 million as of July 22.","We continue to have full availability under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.","Our operating cash flow estimate for 2013 is slightly higher, at approximately $1.2 billion, using the current strip and revised volume forecast. That's versus a CapEx forecast for the year of $1.7 billion, and that includes the asset purchase we made from Chesapeake that we announced earlier in the second quarter. So along with the proceeds we received from the sale of Sunrise, we're clearly in very good shape, from a liquidity perspective, heading into the rest of the year.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.","David L. Porges","Thank you, Phil. As Phil summarized, operationally, we are coming off another record quarter, with record volumes at Production and Midstream. We hit a significant milestone in the quarter, our first day of sales above 1 Bcfe. In fact, we averaged over 1 Bcfe per day for the entire quarter. So congratulations to the EQT Production folks who made that happen, along with the Midstream folks who moved those volumes and the Commercial folks who sold them.","Production volumes were higher than expected because we turned pads and lines faster than planned. We have discussed the lumpiness of volume growth resulting from the timing of turning pads and line Midstream projects, et cetera, and this lumpiness was again evident in the second quarter, with some anticipated third quarter production being accelerated into the second quarter because of the timing of some specific pads. Much of this increased volume flowed through our gathering and transmission systems, driving the growth in those businesses also.","We finished frac-ing our third Utica well during the quarter. But since we were waiting for a gathering line, we just turned our first Utica well in hours ago -- turned it in line hours ago. The other 2 Utica wells should be turned-in-line next month. So while we would like to provide Utica results on today's call, we instead ask that you be a little bit more patient.","We do have 4 Upper Devonian wells in line, and are quite encouraged by the early results. These 4 wells have an average EUR of 1.2 Bcfe per 1,000 feet, which is near the high end of our expected range. Put another way, a well with 4,800 feet of lateral pay would have an EUR of about 5.8 Bcfe.","While the economics of the Upper Devonian wells are not quite as high as the Marcellus wells, they're still quite good with average after-tax IRRs in the mid-30s and a $4 gas price.","Also, the overall economics for EQT are boosted by the efficiency involved with drilling these wells at the same time and place as Marcellus wells. Based on the early success, we are tweaking our drilling program a bit.","We are increasing the Upper Devonian program by 11 wells to a new total of 22, that's in 2013. At the same time, we are reducing our Marcellus program by 11 wells to a new total of 146. We will continue to drill the Marcellus and Upper Devonian wells on the same pad, using the same rigs and completion equipment. So even though the well allocations are tweaked slightly, the overall activity is essentially unchanged.","Increase in Upper Devonian wells accomplishes 2 things: it accelerates the de-risking of the play and it allows us to improve productivity by increasing the total wells per pad, leveraging the surface cost across more wells. If we had stuck with the original plan, we would have foregone some efficiencies, as we would have still drilled the Marcellus wells at those pads, but would then have moved the equipment off of those locations and would have had to incur more costs to return to the pads in the future to drill Upper Devonian wells.","Shifting gears, as you no doubt saw, we completed our first drop into our MLP. Last week, we sold our Sunrise Pipeline to EQT Midstream Partners for $507.5 million in cash and $32.5 million worth of common and general partnership units. EQT Midstream Partners also agreed to pay additional consideration of $110 million to EQT upon the execution of a third-party transportation agreement that we expect to close concurrent with the closing of the utility sale. To pay for the acquisition, EQM issued 12.65 million units. Post transaction, EQT now owns 42.6% of the LP units and a 2% general partnership interest. As a reminder, EQT does have incentive distribution rights, which means once the quarterly distributions per unit hit predetermined thresholds, the percentage of incremental cash flows paid to the GP increases up to a maximum of 50% of incremental cash flows.","There are 2 intermediate steps between the 2% and 50% levels, with those breakpoints being at just over $0.40 per unit -- just under $0.44 per unit, and then finally reaching the 50% split level at $0.525 per unit. Now assuming that EQT Midstream Partners increases the distribution by $0.03 per unit each quarter, from its current $0.40, EQT would be into the 50% splits before the end of 2014. Do recall that for each split, the higher share only applies on the amount above the base. So if there were ever a moment at which the distribution were exactly $0.525 per unit or that breakpoint in the 50% split, the GP would be receiving about 7.5% of that distribution plus 50% of the amount over that level. Based on our internal estimates, cash flow to EQT, just from its GP stake, is projected to be about $33 million for 2015. Applying publicly traded GP multiples to that estimate would result in potential value to EQT shareholders of around $6 per share at that time.","The timing and size of EQT drops can materially impact this cash flow estimate, higher or lower, and the trading multiples seen today could be higher or lower. That said, it is clear that there is significant value in our GP stake, and that's the reason we wanted to give you some insight into how we look at that value.","Switching topics, we have nothing new to report on the regulatory reviews related to the sale of our gas utility, Equitable Gas Company. As you already know, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act expired, and we are free to proceed from a Federal Trade Commission perspective. We have also submitted filings with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the West Virginia Public Service Commission, the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, each of which must approve the transaction as part of the regulatory process. There have not been any unexpected developments in this lengthy process, and we still expect to receive all necessary approvals by around year end.","Finally, as has been our norm, we are providing production sales guidance for the current quarter, so that means the third quarter 2013. Based on our current pad completion schedule, we expect third quarter production sales to be flat with second quarter at 92.5 Bcfe, as new pads provide volume that offsets declines from initial production at those wells we turned-in-line during the recently completed [indiscernible]. We did increase our full year forecast between 360 and 365 Bcfe, which is 40% higher than last year's.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and appreciate your continued support.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat for the Q&A session.","Patrick John Kane","Thank you, Dave. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Yussaf, can we please now open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Dave, maybe just first quick question. I won't stay too long on the Utica. You mentioned about finished frac-ing the 3 well. Did you mention that you tied the first drill in the pipeline? Did I understand that right?","David L. Porges","Yes, that was just hours ago. Yes.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then you think on a go-forward basis now -- I mean I know there had been some midstream delays, so once you got this first one on, is it fair to say, as you and Steve start rolling out these wells, you'll be able to tie them in a sort of timely fashion?","David L. Porges","Well certainly we'd be able to tie them in, if it were just Steve and I turning them in line.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","That's good news for the shareholder, because other people are doing it.","David L. Porges","But yes, look, the issue we're probably going to have on Midstream with the Utica is going to be the same as others do, which is we're in a window where we've anticipated that there's going to be a -- there could be some wet gas. And, of course, it will be the processing that's the issue. So as far as the pipe, yes, I think we're fine on that for our plans. And then the issue is going to be when we decide that what we really need to do to extract the most economics is to strip the liquids.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Crude oil of course, to the extent we have that, if something is coming out, if it's liquid, it's surface pressures, then it's -- that's, of course, a different story, that's a little bit easier to deal with over time.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I know you all have said, kind of reaching that, I don't know, if it's 50,000 what your goal is now. I mean if -- is there a certain time that if -- I know acreage is a bit tougher to come by there. What's your thoughts on that, Dave? I mean would you still sort of stick with what you have? Or is it kind of an all-or-nothing deal as you can't add a significant amount of acreage here in the near future?","David L. Porges","Well, the 50,000 acres, of course, was always just kind of a benchmark. What we really mean is something that is an economical size. So that's -- at this point, we're encouraged that there are some pieces out there that we can look at and we'll just have to see how that plays out. I actually don't know that I'd say that acreage is not available, I think that a lot of folks are sorting through their portfolios. I mean I understand that's a routine thing to happen. Maybe it's more normal that it's happening now after a lot of people compiled portfolios, and now they're sorting through, just as we are with our portfolio, of course. What fits, what doesn't fit. And not just from a perspective of what looks good from a reserve perspective, but what helps you put together a development plan of a reasonable scale. And I think that we're all kind of going through that process. So I'm not discouraged, actually, about there being no opportunities out there.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Got it. And then turning over to, obviously, Marcellus. I was just looking at your slide, where you sort of outlined the amount of Midstream, as far as the transmission capacity, over 1.7 billion and the miles of transmission pipeline. I guess what I'm getting at is, now that you're able to turn these pads and lines faster than expected, obviously it's a nice problem to have. I guess my question is, it seems like because you guys do control your own pipeline or your own Midstream, do you have -- are you going to be ramping that up as far as how quick and how much money you'll be adding to the Midstream? Or are the plans already sufficient enough to sort of factor in this faster pads and lines coming on?","David L. Porges","Well we certainly have plans and line that are consistent with the production plans. But it is a rapid rate, there's no doubt about that. So that does require a fair amount of hustling to keep going and it's not -- we continue to be open to moving some of our volumes through other people's lines, just as we're -- we build our facilities to often times accommodate other producers. So I guess we have kept that in mind. Now we don't, of course, control our own processing, right? So that's one where we continue to work with folks who do that to make sure that, contractually, we're able to organize enough capacity. But the volumes are going up so quickly in this neck of the woods that I'd say we're always feeling as if we're running pretty fast. So I don't know that we'd ever want to feel that we're sanguine, I think we feel optimistic that we can get things done, but I -- we can't rest on our laurels because the lines are just jumping up so quickly.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And last question, if -- I think you've said this before. Do I understand this right, as far as kind of potential for dropdown it's in the Midstream, whatever. If you are able to bring on a little more, you spend a little more in that area, is it always -- continue to drop down about 1\/4 of what you have or if you could just remind us of kind of the plans on a kind of annual basis of what you potentially could drop down?","David L. Porges","Well we don't really have a plan on an annual basis that goes out there. We have said that, over time -- let's say the floor is that we would like to be generating proceeds at the EQT level from drops that equals the amount of spending EQT has on the Midstream. But over time, of course, we will want to be dropping more into EQM than we are spending. So -- and the other thing that's taken into account when you're looking at the -- what I gather from the market's perspective was larger-than-expected drop, is a lot of these assets that we'll be dropping, when we do drop a specific project or asset, they're going to be lumpy. So some of them are going to be larger and some of them are going to be smaller. But we're -- you should not take the size of that drop to be an indication that somehow we've ramped up our decisions on spending at Midstream at EQT level. We're going to keep dropping as it looks economic to do so. And it's just that we've got this floor where, over time, we'd like to make sure we're dropping enough so that the proceeds are going to be paying for the Midstream expenditures.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO Capital Markets.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","With over $1 billion in cash coming in, in the second half with -- from EQM and the utility sale and then what looks to be a minimal outspend in 2014 and beyond, how are you thinking about capital allocation between: one, accelerating in the Marcellus; two, share buybacks there; or, three, increasing the dividend?","David L. Porges","We are looking at it -- I don't want to be trite here, but we are looking at the same way we will always look at it. We think that -- we're not -- we don't believe our decisions are being, or should be, overly influenced by what the balance sheet says. Unless, of course, we just didn't have enough money to do some of the things that we wanted. But we should be investing in the projects that create value and foregoing the projects that don't. Being temporarily a little bit more liquid, we don't feel, creates any pressure or burning holes in our pockets, et cetera. So we do examine other ways to invest the money, such as share buybacks and dividends. But we view it the same way I'd say that we always do. We compare the investment opportunities and, yes, anybody who looks at our incentive comp plans knows that the way that this management gets paid is to have our share price perform over the course of time. So hopefully, we're aligned with the shareholders in that regard. We just want to create value. And I'd say from that perspective, it hasn't changed. When I became CEO, the strategy was we need to pick what we want to invest in and what we want to offload. And I'd just say that we're kind of in the midst of that process. So we'll continue also to look at monetizing things that whereby perhaps the value is greater in the hands of others.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then, on EQM, with the GP potentially in the high end of the split in the next 18 months, and probably -- could be earlier, assuming a lower coverage ratio of 1.1x. I mean, how would that impact the valuation and EQM's ability to raise capital to pay for future dropdowns, given that the GP will be in the high end of the split so early? And then where was the GP valued at in the $32.5 million of proceeds of EQM's stock per unit?","David L. Porges","Actually, Phil probably has the answer to that. Or why answer the rest? [indiscernible] How much of the $32.5 million was extra LP units versus...","Philip P. Conti","Yes. The units that we got back, in addition to the cash, were 480,000 limited partner units and then 268 GP units -- 268,000.","David L. Porges","Another way to look at that would be the 400,000 LP units at the market price at that time, and then the rest is the GP. So [indiscernible] LP, and the rest, GP. Go ahead.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then next question, can you share with us your views, both near-term and long-term, on where you see Marcellus base is going? And then how the recent weakness will impact the third quarter?","David L. Porges","Well, that's -- for that one, I've been doing a lot of the talking. So I will turn that over to Randy. Though we -- and -- Randy, what are your thoughts on bases?","Randall L. Crawford","Sure. When you talk about short term and long term. In the short term, right, I mean, the influx of supply, the natural gas in the region, is -- for the purpose of blending, higher-Btu ethane, producers to put pressure on the basin. So -- but -- this is, we think, will be somewhat alleviated with the Mariner West project that just came online this week, and the ATEX project that is said to come on in early 2014. And just to close the loop on that ethane topic, EQT has a tremendous dry gas resource in Western PA, as you know, and particularly in Greene County, so that provides us the ability to blend our ethane with wet gas production for the foreseeable future. Now in regard to the long term, in the long term, we have stayed ahead of the curve in terms of planning our takeaway capacity. So currently we have almost 655 million decatherms per day of firm pipeline capacity that's out of the basin, and we have approximately 400 million decatherms per day of firm sales. And so -- for a total of about 1.05 Bcf per day. So we recognize that the basin is in its growing stage and we're remaining flexible with regard to making additional long-term commitments. And obviously with that said -- we have committed to an incremental 300 million a day pipeline capacity expansion into the Gulf Coast, in the Mid-Atlantic markets, which we have scheduled to come on in service by the end of 2014. So moving forward, we continue to add firm capacity to portfolio and we add to the diversity of markets. And so, we've been on this issue and we're continuing to look at those diversity of markets and liquidities. So in the long run, we think that including the growing Southeast markets, we should be in good shape.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Great. And then last question, real quick. Where -- on the Upper Devonian wells, did you use RCS on those?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Phil, this is Steve. We used RCS on 1 of the 4 wells that we have production date on. So the results that we're quoting are 3\/4 based on our 60-foot clusters and 1\/4 based on the 30-foot cluster test. So -- and our expectation is, just like we're seeing in the Marcellus, I think we'll have to test this to find out, but I think we're -- we think it's likely that the Upper Devonian will benefit from 30-foot cluster spacing. So for the wells we're drilling this year, they'll be using the 30-foot clusters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So with your updated 2013 outlook for the higher production, do you have any update for what 2014 production will look like?","David L. Porges","No, we haven't read -- of course, we introduced some guidance on that, but we're now getting to the point we're in the run-up to our annual capital budget and plan process, so we don't want to get out in front of our board as far as what kind of approvals we'll get for that. So at this point, this time of year typically, also, we'd just as soon stick with the guidance that we've put out there. And then, of course, we'll update that once we have a under-capital budget.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So I guess presuming directionally higher is maybe getting ahead of ourselves, I guess?","David L. Porges","I just -- in case our board members are listening, and I don't want to presume something that assumes that they'll provide approvals to stuff that we're proposing to them but haven't actually put in front of them, yes.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's fair enough, fair enough.","David L. Porges","Not great timing for that, is all I'd say.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. Okay. That's fair, that's fair. And then you talked about reducing your Marcellus program this year by 11 wells, is that pretty evenly distributed across your development areas?","Philip P. Conti","Yes, and that's really just driven by the desire to maximize our rig efficiencies and drilling more Upper Devonian wells while the rigs are on certain locations. Given the results we've seen in the Upper Devonian, we think that's the prudent thing to do. So, yes, it's pretty equally spread around.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Can you talk about initial rates on those Upper Devonian wells?","Philip P. Conti","I don't think we've provided IPs but, again, the average is about 1,200 or 1.2 bcf per 1,000 feet EURs. And for these wells, we actually have a fair amount of production history. So the oldest well has been producing for 3 years and another couple for 2 years and the fourth one for a year. So I think these are not as speculative as EURs as you might have imagined that they are in terms of how much data we had to look at. I'd also say that, again, since these wells were drilled 2, 3 years ago, our drilling completion techniques in the Marcellus have improved pretty dramatically over that time. We're certainly hopeful that we'll see that same kind of improvement in the wells we're drilling today in the Upper Devonian. Time will tell if that's true or not, but we certainly are optimistic that we can improve on what we've seen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","I guess, a couple on my end, first, more near-term oriented. Just curious on the third quarter production volume guidance. Are there any kind of implicit assumptions around building up or drawing down of completion backlogs within that?","Philip P. Conti","No, all I'd say is if -- you've probably noticed in the second quarter, we drew down the backlog pretty substantially. All of that is just driven by the timing of these large multi-well multistage pads. It just worked out that a lot of them came on in the second quarter, which means they'll probably be -- rigs will be moving to new multi-well pads, so there'll be a bit of a hiatus in new TILs in the third quarter. So I would expect that you'll see that backlog build back up somewhat in the third quarter. But it's all driven just by the timing of these big pads.","Michael Hall","Okay. So it is somewhat assumed that you'll have some increase in backlog again in the third quarter?","Philip P. Conti","Yes, I would expect that. Which is why we're projecting basically flat volumes in the third quarter over the second, but the backlog should increase.","Michael Hall","That makes sense. And can you just remind me where -- or like how many of your rigs are in each of your key areas at this point? Meaning Northern West Virginia, Southwestern PA and then Central PA?","Philip P. Conti","I believe right now we have 3 in Southwestern PA and 3 in Northern West Virginia. Pretty sure that's right. They move around a little bit, so I'm not always completely up to speed.","Michael Hall","Okay. But that kind of 50-50 split is probably fair throughout the rest of the year, is it?","Philip P. Conti","Yes, I think that would be pretty close.","Michael Hall","Okay. Let's see -- and then I guess a lot of my others have been addressed. I'm curious on the inclusion of additional Upper Devonian wells and doing those on the same pads as the Marcellus wells, does that -- how do we think about that in terms of cycle times for those pads? Is it just going to spread things out a bit more? Although reducing the per-well cost because you're going to spread it over the pad, over more wells, is it spreading out the cycle times a bit as well?","Philip P. Conti","That's a good question and I probably can't give you a great answer yet. That's certainly a topic that we are actively studying now, trying to determine what is the optimum scenario, especially for these very large pads. So if we have a 10-well Marcellus pad and the opportunity to drill another 10 Upper Devonian pads for a total of 20, we're currently modeling. Does it make sense, is it optimum to drill all 20 right now? Or does it make sense to drill 5 Marcellus, 5 Upper Devonian, leave and come back later? Or should we drill all the Marcellus now and come back? And some of the issues are just logistical in nature, but there's also some factors around -- some concerns around the effectiveness of the fracs, particularly in the Upper Devonian, if we would come back significantly later after frac-ing the Marcellus because of depletion and potential interference between the 2. So we're doing a lot of reservoir modeling combined with a lot of logistical study to sort of sort. So bottom line is, right now, I don't -- I can't tell you what the optimum is and what the impact will be. Part of the reason that we're drilling some more Upper Devonians this year on existing pads is to help us figure out how that -- what the optimum is going to be.","Michael Hall","Okay, that makes sense. And so, I'm correct in assuming you can't -- you're not doing simultaneous completions while drilling, correct? You can't do both on the same pad?","Philip P. Conti","I don't know that we're -- we're not frac-ing while drilling, but we're doing a lot of other simultaneous operations, a lot more than we used to.","Michael Hall","Okay. And then I guess the last on my end is more of just kind of getting back to corporate structure and thinking about unlocking some of the value. As we get -- we're getting closer toward the end of the year, you've talked about a couple of other different ways to, say, monetize some latent value. You brought up in the past potentially bringing in or trying to find third-party capital around the Huron program to restart that growth. Also now with ONEOK's announcement of spinning out the utility and have a standalone GP that maybe raises some [indiscernible]. Another interesting comp around EQT in terms of unlocking value, you did highlight you'll be hitting those splits relatively soon. So I'm just trying to think through, and better understand, what current thoughts are today, particularly in the context of that ONEOK announcement.","David L. Porges","Well the ONEOK announcement, itself, of course, doesn't really have much impact on us. We looked at the alternatives around LDC before we decided to sell, as opposed to doing some type of a spinoff and things like that. We looked at that. Well we're obviously interested to read more, as we are with any of our companies and any of our peer group, interested to read what they're up to and look at their rationale and see how it turns out for them. But the thought process we have on monetizing other assets as a best way to create shareholder value is really the same as it was. If we're not going to be able to -- or don't think it's economical for us to do the development, the optimal development of those assets, then we look at alternatives, whether it's selling to somebody else, as we've done a couple of times, or getting some other source of capital, as we have, of course, with the Midstream, with the MLP. So I don't think there's anything magic about year end for that. We're obviously not pressured from a liquidity perspective, that's in reasonable shape, I'd say. So we'll continue to work on that. I mean the -- so the urgency isn't raising capital, the urgency is doing the right thing to create value. And we continue to look at those alternatives. I mean, obviously, Nora and Huron are ones that we've talked about the possibility of having different approaches to that. With Midstream, I think the issue is going to be drops and I think a lot more of that is going to be driven by what's going in EQM than EQT, what the capacities are and things like that since, again, we do think that the best owner of a lot of those assets is probably EQM, as opposed to EQT. And then to help you figure out what we do with it, with the MLP, generally, and the GP, you're right, we started introducing the issue of how much value could be there and, frankly, we're going to be trying to being -- encouraging our shareholders to take a look at what that value is. And it's hard to tell whether there's going to be enough transparency there that things will be fine as we move through the splits or whether the right thing to do will be to do something else. The separate issue somebody else had raised about what do you do when you get into a high splits for the GP, that's a real issue for MLPs when they grow that fast. And separate from EQT corporate structure issues, when we get to that point, we will have to address that issue so that EQM is able to make acquisitions that are accretive for its unitholders.","Michael Hall","That's helpful. Can you remind me what the timing or potential timing around when EQM would be more self-sufficient from a CapEx funding perspective?","David L. Porges","I don't know what's...","Michael Hall","Does that get accelerated at all, given that the size of the drop is a bit bigger than expected?","David L. Porges","Can you help me a little bit with what you mean by self-sufficient? Because it's -- that's a market where there are -- unlike the C core [ph] market for oil and gas companies where issuing equity is not possible...","Michael Hall","I guess what I mean is the growth -- a lot of the growth capital is being spent at EQT, currently, and then matured under EQT, and then dropped down eventually into EQM?","David L. Porges","I think it's -- the way I kind of think of it is just -- this is [ph] very rough -- and hopefully the team doesn't view this as some kind of a revelation, but it seems, just from observation, that spending roughly 10% of one's cash flow on organic investments is something that can be worn reasonably comfortably at an MLP. The issue is more that it's able to continue to grow its distributable cash flow per unit. And that's just hard to do when you have capital tied up in long-lead-time projects. So that's really the drive, right? If we spend a lot of money at EQM on multiyear projects, it would be tough for it to increase its distributable cash flow per unit. Now obviously, quick-turnaround projects, so de-bottlenecking and things like that, there's probably no grade limit on that. But as far as bigger projects, I think it's much more, can EQM continue to increase its distribution to per unit at comps? So let's say the comps and coverage rates, with money tied up in long lead time projects. Does that...","Michael Hall","Yes, that's helpful. I was just trying to also think through this, when -- just when we could think about breaking up the Midstream\/MLP ownership within EQT from the upstream to maybe better highlight the value of the Midstream units, but [indiscernible].","David L. Porges","I don't think that issue of EQM being able to make the investments directly as opposed to EQT necessarily get in the way of the structuring issues. Frankly, the same thing is true of the GP going to higher splits. I think those are separable issues.","Operator","Our next question comes from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Investors (sic) (Advisors).","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","I have a question of what you would do with the excess cash that you have at EQT? Could you talk about your capacity to increase drilling levels in terms of the ability to get permits, crews. By how much could you increase that capacity?","David L. Porges","Do you have a number? I think I'll punt that to Steve, since I don't have an answer.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Thanks, Dave. I don't have an answer either. I think we certainly feel like we have the capacity to expand our program. I can't give you specifics, but I will say the -- we don't really anticipate any issues on the service side. So access to rigs and frac crews and associated services, I think we don't view as really troublesome to expand that. I think the governor of our pace expansion will likely be on the land side, our ability to permit wells and put together drilling units that make sense and to drill multi-well pads. And that's a difficult thing to predict too far in the future, to get too far ahead of where we're at. But we're obviously very focused on that and doing our best to make sure we have the opportunity to expand. And I think, certainly, we can do more than we're currently doing.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then on -- just to go back to the GP stake, I think that you said, Dave, that you're expecting $33 million from the GP stake by '15? Is that just the GP stake alone and not including the LP distribution?","David L. Porges","That's exactly correct. That's just the GP stake, given the assumptions that I had laid out. And honestly, it was really designed to try to give a sense of where the GP value could be heading for EQT.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then, finally, on Huron, if you were to get a JV on that, any idea of the potential for Midstream spend on that space?","David L. Porges","I -- there certainly will be a need for Midstream whenever Huron development recommences, no matter whose money it is. You could go a little ways with very little Midstream spend. And then we're going to have to get into -- they're going to have to be spending around it. So that -- and that -- but then the issue of -- depending on what kind of structure happens at the Huron is that EQT stuff that gets dropped into EQM that go into whatever vehicle it is, that -- at this point, that's probably, from our perspective, getting a little bit ahead of it. We have observed that most producers don't -- most don't really want the Midstream, but we have observed it.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","I guess I'm asking I think a little bit different question. Not so much structure, but just saying, in general, used to be when you focused on that area, there was -- if you were to grow materially, there was going to be a need for a lot more Midstream CapEx spend. And if it's -- I'm not really -- doesn't matter who spends it, but just some idea that...","David L. Porges","That's true. That is still true. We can probably go a year or 2 without much spend or a low level of growth. You could still get by with very little spend. And if there were a material ramp up, to use your word, Becca, then you'd have to get into spending more on the Midstream again. More material money on the Midstream.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Any idea of magnitude? Couple hundred million?","David L. Porges","No, I really haven't looked at that case very closely, to be honest.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob McNally.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by discussing several of our key achievements during the quarter, before moving on to our standard quarterly update. We've made tremendous progress toward the separation of our Midstream and Upstream businesses. We've completed all of the midstream streamlining transactions that we previously announced in April.","On May 22, we closed two transactions, the sale of EQT's Ohio gathering assets to EQM for $1.15 billion in cash and 5.9 million EQM units and the sale of RMP's IDRs to EQGP for 36.3 million EQGP units. On July 23, EQM completed the acquisition of Rice Midstream Partners in a unit-for-unit transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.3319. To support these transactions, EQM successfully issued $2.5 billion of senior notes. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under EQM's 364-day term loan to pay off RMP's revolver and for general business purposes.","The two remaining important items in our separation plan are the appointment of a new CEO and the filing of the Form 10. The CEO search is well underway and we expect to have a CEO named prior to the separation. We plan to file the Form 10 by mid August, which means the separation will likely occur in the fourth quarter. While the ultimate timing depends on the SEC and IRS, we cannot be certain as to how quickly they will act. Our goal is to close the separation as soon as possible.","We are committed to ensuring that both the Production and Midstream businesses emerge from the separation with strong investment grade balance sheets. To achieve this objective, EQT will retain 19.9% of SpinCo's stock, which will be used to reduce debt at EQT Corp. and to fund the stock buyback program. As a result of this share retention, we do not expect SpinCo itself to have any outstanding indebtedness at the time of the separation.","Our board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program effective immediately. Given our view that EQT stock is not reflecting the full value of our E&P and Midstream businesses, we expect to begin using this buyback authority as soon as possible. We are pleased with this approval as it is one way for EQT to return value to its shareholders. In the same light, we did repurchase 700,000 EQT shares in the second quarter, taking advantage of the previously approved share repurchase authorization. Buying back EQT shares ahead of the split will benefit the shareholders of both companies.","In June, we completed the sale of our Permian Basin assets for $64 million in cash, which also relieved EQT of approximately $40 million of liabilities associated with the assets. Earlier this month, we completed the sale of our non-core Huron assets for $575 million in cash and relieved EQT of approximately $200 million of assumed liabilities.","Now, focusing on the Midstream side, as you may have read in EQM and EQGP's second quarter press release, the MVP JV announced a modification to its construction schedule and now anticipates a first quarter 2019 in-service date. More information on MVP can be found in EQM and EQGP's press release issued earlier this morning.","Now, on to results for the quarter. EQT announced second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.44 compared to $0.07 in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $526 million for the second quarter, a $296 million increase year-over-year. SEC rules prevent us from adding expenses related to the separation back to adjusted operating cash flow. As a reminder, the results of EQGP, EQM, RMP and Strike Force Midstream are consolidated in EQT's results. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $118.5 million for the quarter compared to $81.5 million in the second quarter of last year.","Now, moving on to the segment results, starting with EQT Production. Second quarter sales volumes were 363 Bcfe and fell within the stated guidance range of 360 to 370 Bcfe. Volumes were 83% higher than the second quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of the Rice acquisition. Average differentials of negative $0.43 for the quarter came in 33% better than the negative $0.64 in the second quarter of 2017. Differential improvements were offset by lower NYMEX price of $2.80 compared to $3.18 last year.","The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.81 per Mcfe, a 2% decrease compared to the second quarter of last year. Operating revenues totaled $951 million for the second quarter of 2018, $320 million higher than the second quarter of 2017 due to increased production associated with the acquisition. Approximately $13 million of EQT Production's operating revenue is considered pipeline and net marketing services revenue.","We recast the segment to reflect the midstream asset drop, which resulted in third-party gathering revenue generated from the dropped assets being moved from the EQT Production segment to EQM Gathering segment. Thus, the $13 million in EQT Production's result cannot be directly compared to our stated guidance in April of $15 million to $20 million. Adjusting for the recast, the pipeline and net marketing services revenue would have been $24 million. Total operating expenses, excluding $118 million in asset impairment, were $912 million or 58% higher year-over-year and cash operating cost per Mcfe were 20% lower than last year.","Now, moving on to the Midstream results. As mentioned, EQM's results have been recast to include the pre-acquisition results of midstream assets acquired by EQM from EQT. EQM Gathering operating income for the second quarter was $122 million, $38 million higher than the second quarter of 2017. Operating revenues were $68 million higher than the second quarter of 2017 primarily due to the acquired Ohio gathering assets. Operating expenses for EQM Gathering were $59 million, $30 million higher than the second quarter of 2017. Again, this variance was primarily from the acquired assets.","EQM Transmission operating income for the second quarter was $61 million, $3 million higher than the second quarter of 2017. Operating revenues were $4 million higher than the second quarter of 2017. Expenses for EQM Transmission were $29 million, which is $2 million higher than the second quarter of 2017. Now, moving to RMP Gathering and RMP Water, RMP Gathering reported an operating income of $40 million, while RMP Water reported an operating income of $24 million.","Now, onto our cash flow and liquidity position. As of June 30, EQT had $200 million of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the $2.5 billion credit facility. EQT's current cash balance, excluding EQM and EQGP, is approximately $200 million and there is full availability on our $2.5 billion revolver. We currently forecast between $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion of adjusted operating cash flow for 2018 at EQT, which includes approximately $350 million to $400 million from EQT's interest in EQM, EQGP and RMP.","Please note that the adjusted operating cash flow guidance for the year has been adjusted for the Huron asset sale and does not include taxes or costs related to the separation. With our forecasted adjusted operating cash flow and cash on hand, we expect to fully fund our forecasted 2018 capital expenditure plan of $2.4 billion. Lastly, I want to thank our employees and advisors for their hard work and dedication and our shareholders for their continued support.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David to make some comments on operations.","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by providing an update on 2018 sales volume. As Rob mentioned, Q2 volume was within guidance at 363 Bcfe and represents a slight increase over Q1 volume of 357 Bcfe. We still expect sequential quarterly growth for the remainder of the year and are guiding Q3 at 370 to 380 Bcfe, an 8% quarter-over-quarter growth \u2013 increase adjusting for the Huron. Huron adjusted full-year guidance is now 1,490 to 1,510 Bcfe and is consistent with prior guidance.","Moving on to operations, we continue to realize capital synergies from the Rice acquisition, as we develop our large contiguous acreage position. In our Southwestern Pennsylvania Core, our 2018 drilling program is now expected to deliver an average lateral length of 14,200 feet, which is 55% higher than our 2017 Southwestern Pennsylvania average prior to the Rice acquisition. In addition, our land group's efforts have also allowed us to lengthen approximately 70 prior year DUCs by an average of 3,000 feet each.","As a reminder, we typically use top-hole rigs to drill the vertical section and curve of a well and then bring in a more expensive horizontal rig to drill the lateral. The timing gap created by swapping out the rigs, which is typically four to six months, creates an additional opportunity for land to extend laterals, even after we spud a well. This was of particular importance following the Rice acquisition, as we have the opportunity to significantly lengthen many wells, even though those wells had already been spud by EQT or Rice.","As a result of these efforts and in conjunction with our 2018 drilling program realizing longer than planned lateral lengths, we'll reach our targets for feet of pay completed and feet of pay drilled, two important productivity targets, while spudding 34 fewer wells than we planned in 2018. On an activity level, the second quarter was the highest in EQT history with the company operating as many as 15 rigs and 12 frac crews. This resulted in nearly 680,000 feet of pay being fracked, which is 55% higher than our previous record.","On the drilling side, we have already drilled as much footage in the first half of 2018 as we did in the full-year 2017. This activity was completed while making significant efficiency gains with fracked footage per day and drilled footage per day up 20% and 25% respectively over 2017 numbers. These results illustrate the benefits of EQT's manufacturing model and specifically our real-time operating centers.","Finally, the increased activity in Q2 will result in higher sales volumes in Q3 and Q4 with us turning in line approximately 50% more feet of pay in the second half of 2018 as we did in the first half. We expect Q2 to be the high point for CapEx this year and reiterate our full-year guidance of $2.2 billion for well development. In the second half of 2018, we will return to a more moderate activity level, ramping down to six to seven frac crews running at the end of the year and 13 to 14 rigs.","I will now turn the call over to Pat.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thank you, David. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Doug, will you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","You talked a lot about the buyback here, and it seems like there are three avenues you have to fund the buyback: asset sales, which you've done with the Huron sale here; the midstream SpinCo proceeds, which you're highlighting might be an option to use for share repurchase; and the third lever might be activity levels and growth. Can you talk about the key constraints that you're looking for, particularly on the latter two, i.e., what your target balance sheet would be as you think about how much proceeds could be used from the midstream SpinCo towards share repurchase? And then also whether you would consider slowing your growth rate and using the excess free cash flow for share repurchase?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So, there's several things in that question, Brian. So, let me start and deal with them one at a time. Yeah, as we think about the appropriate growth rate for the company, we certainly see the need to balance generating free cash with a moderate growth rate. We're currently working through that with the board and we'll have a better guidance for you later in the year on what we think the forward growth rate will be. But we certainly do think there has to be a balance between returning cash to shareholders with growth.","In terms of the share repurchase, we have a $500 million authorization from our board, and once we have used that up, depending on what the balance sheet looks like and what the environment is like, we could certainly consider going back to the board for further authorization. In previous calls and commentary, we have said that we want to see our leverage levels at less than 2 times debt to EBITDA and preferably more like 1.5 times debt to EBITDA. And so, that's the target range that we still believe is right for EQT going forward.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. And then, my follow-up is maybe a little bit of the reverse, which has to do with the better environment here for natural gas prices locally and as well the storage situation nationally. Given the deficit we have in storage and some improvement that we've seen in local Appalachia prices, combined with some of the efficiency gains you've highlighted, how do you think about potentially increasing activity or what would you need to see to increase activity?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I think clearly, Brian, in a higher gas price environment, higher realizations, the math on returns will tell us that we're better off to increase growth rates and production. But we haven't seen a significant move in realized prices. While there have been some modest improvements locally in bases, that's been partially offset by lower NYMEX pricing. So, I would say that that dynamic isn't pushing us to increase production at this point.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. On retaining those SpinCo shares, can you give us some sense of what is your plan to like \u2013 how do you look to monetize that? Is it something we should expect pretty quickly? Is it going be systematic, opportunistic? And with that, what was really the driving force behind making that decision to retain that, those SpinCo shares? Was it specifically to have the access to extra liquidity or was it for more, during the spin process, to make it a little I guess cleaner for investors that would have been spun a little bit more shares?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I mean the real driver here was this was an avenue for us to right-size the EQT balance sheet and get to the liquidity levels that we want and be able to fund a share buyback prior to the spin, because we were retaining that value and it gives us confidence that we would have the available capital to fund the buyback without putting undue leverage at the SpinCo level, all right. So, we want \u2013 our goal all along was that we would have two independent companies with strong healthy balance sheets, and this was the most elegant way to accomplish that goal, as well as fund the share buyback.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And how do you want to execute that?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","The share buyback?","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No, no, no, the sale of the retained shares.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yes, sorry. So, we're required by the IRS in the spin that we would have to dispose of those shares within five years. My expectation is though that we will do it significantly quicker than that, and it's not something that likely happens right out of the gate. So, I think that there will be some churn in the SpinCo shares as they trade to more natural shareholders. But within the first couple of years, I would expect that we would exit that position.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","But the requirement is just that we do it within the first five years.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And as a follow-up to the question Brian had there just on looking at growth rates versus capital returns to the shareholder \u2013 returns to shareholder. You had previously obviously, when you've gone down this path with the separation, talked about 15% kind of growth rates, and now there's a little bit more moderation. Can you give a little background again, what's really driven sort of that thought process change and how meaningful of a change in that growth rate are you guys evaluating?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Well, I think that the driver really is feedback from the market. It appears to us that there's not really an appetite by shareholders and capital markets in general to fund growth outside of cash flow. So, we think that getting to a position where our growth is within \u2013 we can fund it within cash flow and then also return some cash to shareholders is the right way to go. And I think that we've been \u2013 as an industry and as a company, we've been moving in that direction for at least the last year.","So, in terms of what the particular growth rates are going to be, I would say it's less than what it has been historically. I don't think that 15%-plus growth rates are the right thing to do for the company and for shareholders. As we work through the budgeting process with our board this fall, we'll give you more concrete guidance on what that growth rate looks like. But it's also going to be dependent on what the commodity price environment is as well, where I think in a higher commodity price environment, we'll be biased towards a bit higher growth, and in lower commodity price environments, I suspect it's going to be lower.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. And so \u2013 and this is something you guys are looking to initiate pretty quickly, this potential shift. Is that right? So, it's going to \u2013 would it have an impact on 2019 or is 2019 pretty much locked and loaded with the drilling activity in 2018?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","It could have a modest impact on 2019. But as you point out, the drilling activity that we have undertaken in 2018 largely sets the 2019 growth profile.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Rob, I was wondering if you could kind of walk us through the steps in terms of the separation. You mentioned that the Form 10 would be filed in mid-August. But walk us through kind of the timing and what kind of happens from here. And at what time would you be prepared to provide kind of standalone kind of guidance for EQT Production?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So, from here \u2013 we've essentially completed all of the clean-up transactions that we announced in April and the related financing transactions. So, I would like to say that I'm extremely happy with the progress that we've made and the hard work that our teams have done. I'm really impressed with what we've gotten done. So, what's left now is to file the Form 10, which we expect to do by mid-August, and then with that starts the process with the SEC, which \u2013 that timing then is a bit out of our control.","It depends on how many rounds of questions the SEC has, and then we're also waiting on the PLR from the IRS. And we think that that likely pushes us into the fourth quarter now between those two gating items. I suspect that as we get closer to \u2013 as we get closer to separation, we will likely want to get out and meet with investors, and at that point, I think you'll get standalone guidance from both EQT and SpinCo. So, I don't know what the dates of that will be. But I think in the month leading up to the spin being finalized, you would expect to hear from us with more concrete guidance for both SpinCo and EQT.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just my follow-up, a slight delay here in MVP. Just wondering, Rob, if you can walk through some of the implications to EQT Production. Obviously, that will delay the timing of where you'll incur kind of the transportation costs, but just maybe walk through maybe the impact to EQT from the delay.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. There's really not much of an impact for EQT. It will delay the time at which we can sell volumes at Transco 165. And so it just means that we'll have more volumes being sold at M2 prior to that, but the financial impact is fairly limited to EQT.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Welles Fitzpatrick with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Good morning.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","To follow up on the MVP comment from the last caller, it seemed like there was a little bit of a bump up on the top end of the guidance range as far as CapEx is concerned. Is that just conservatism because of the modest delays? Is that all we should read into that?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. Just, with delays and inefficiencies, costs go up. So, for instance, with the stay that the Fourth Circuit Court put in place, it's caused us to have to jump around a bit and hop over water crossings, and so it just become less efficient and that does drive costs up a bit.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, that makes sense. And then, just one follow-up. Obviously, you guys have talked about slowing the growth rate a little bit, so have your compatriots in the basin and Halliburton. Have you guys seen any of that effect flowing through to well costs? Do you think that that could provide some downward pressure on completion costs as we move through the year?","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Yeah. This is David. I'll tackle that one. I would say yes, we have. Certainly, the pricing environment is different than it was in the first half of 2018, especially on the pressure pumping side, which I think we've seen the most movement. So, I don't know if I have a exact number for you, but it's definitely downward pressure on pricing.","Welles Fitzpatrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great to hear. That's all I have. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Panjwani with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Good morning.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Sticking with the service theme, obviously, you guys are saying that you're seeing downward pressure on costs. But I did notice that your updated development costs came down a couple percent. So, I'm wondering if there's anything beside the cost that there is to provide an update on in terms of capital efficiency improvements.","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I think the driver of that was the lengthening of the laterals that we talked about in my script. So, that's lowering that, I think, by $0.01, I believe those development costs.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, any changes to your estimated maintenance CapEx? I think it was $1.2 billion that you provided previously, in light of the service cost gains and then also in light of the Huron sale.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","No, it's essentially unchanged.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Good morning.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Rob, I guess this one for you on the leverage target and then it's related to the proceeds from the SpinCo shares as you monetize those down the road. Is there some thought in your mind to target that leverage, previous leverage target you had mentioned 1.5 times or to push that lower? And how are you thinking about using the proceeds between share buybacks or return of cash to shareholders and debt reduction?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Well, I think that the $500 million share repurchase that we have authorized, that's all that we have authorized at this point, and the majority of the rest of the value will likely go for debt reduction. And we do think that getting down to that 1.5 times debt to EBITDA is the right place for EQT to be. It puts us in a strong liquidity position. We don't feel the need to get, to move it a lot lower than that. But if it were a little lower, that's fine too.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Rob. That's all I had.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen.","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Hi, Holly.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Good morning.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Maybe the first for David. Just kind of thinking about the TIL schedule for 3Q and 4Q, obviously a big jump up in 3Q. But then, you got 4Q down, which actually looks a lot lower than 4Q 2017. So, is this just timing or should we think about a different pace as we move into 2019 just on this TIL schedule?","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I think you should think about it in terms of it is just timing. I mean that has such an impact and we were really active fracking in the second quarter. So, that's going to probably lead to most of those TILs happening in the third quarter, and that's really all you should read into it.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. And then, maybe I guess also for David on just the NGLs, the C3-plus production. It looks like it's come in a bit. The guidance also a little wider. Is there something we should think about on the NGL side? And maybe adding to that ethane, pricing moving up here a bit on the ethane side. Is there more you can do in terms of pulling out more ethane out of the stream?","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Well, on the first part of the question, I think what you're talking about, the C3-pluses was due to the Huron, the impact of Huron being gone. Maybe Blue will answer the second part of that.","Donald M. Jenkins - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So, in terms of incremental ethane, so we do have some flexibility at the plants in which we process our gas to pull out some incremental ethane. As you would expect, we do that. We've got term contract in the portfolio and then we obviously look to optimize the spot opportunities and we will continue to do that. So, some flexibility around that, Holly.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, great. And then, maybe one last one for me, just maybe a little housekeeping. LOE seem to come in a good bit during the second quarter. Anything to highlight there?","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Come in lower than you expected, is that what you're saying?","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Yes. Yeah.","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Nothing other than the first quarter maybe was a little on the high side because of weather, and in the second quarter, it didn't have those kind of impacts.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Holly.","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jane Trotsenko with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. My first question, what are the key milestones that we need to watch in regards to Mountain Valley Pipeline?","Jeremiah Ashcroft III - EQT Corp.","Yeah, sure. This is Jerry Ashcroft. Good question. The key milestones for us is \u2013 continues to be both weather and us waiting on the Fourth Circuit. We believe in the merits of the motion by the core and are pretty hopeful that that stay will be lifted soon.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I see, I see. And then, on the oilfield service side, do you know what exactly is causing the softening in the oilfield service environment? Is it like other public companies decelerating or is it like privates mostly?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I'd say just broadly it's just a deceleration of activity by us and some of our peers, where we're just \u2013 we've laid down a few frac crews, a few rigs, and it doesn't take much slack in that market for it to really impact pricing. So, I think it's just a general slowing and then there's a bit of excess capacity particularly on the pressure pumping side.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, do you think is it short-term or is it something like a trend that's pointing to the overall deceleration in the sub-basin?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Well, I'd go back to some earlier comments where I think that there's not much appetite for companies to grow outside of cash flow. And so, if you think that the industry as a whole is moving towards a model where growth is constrained by cash flow, then I think that that does put some downward pressure on growth rate, which then presumably creates some excess capacity in terms of services and might continue to put pressure on pricing.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Do you guys think that it will help you to reduce the well cost sometime in future or at least review the well cost assumptions?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Certainly, if we see a meaningful move-down in service cost, then that does impact our well cost and we would update you on that as that progresses.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, sounds good.

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to our Chief Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Pat Kane. Please go ahead, sir.","Patrick Kane","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's Year-end 2014 Conference Call. With me today are Dave Porges, President and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Conti, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Randy Crawford, Senior Vice President and President of Midstream and Commercial; and Steve Schlotterbeck, Executive Vice President and President, Exploration and Production.","This call will be replayed for a 7-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time today. The telephone number for the replay is (888) 445-1112 with the confirmation code of 8636267. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website.","To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, are consolidated in EQT's results. There was a separate press release issued by EQM this morning, and there is a separate conference call at 11:30 a.m. today, which requires us to take the last question at 11:20 on this call. If you're interested in the EQM call, the dial-in number is (913) 312-9034, the confirmation code is 8851668.","In just a moment, Phil will summarize EQT's operational and financial results for the year-end 2014. Next, Steve will summarize the capital budget revisions and the reserve report. Finally, Dave will provide a summary of our strategic and operational matters. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy and Steve will be available to answer your questions.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release under Risk Factors in the EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, which was filed with the SEC; and is updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which were on file at the SEC and available on our website; and the company's Form 10-K for year-end December 31, 2014, which is scheduled to be filed with the SEC next week.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in press release this morning, EQT announced 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.40 per diluted share compared to $1.97 per diluted share in 2013. A high-level story for the year as well as the fourth quarter was a very strong volume growth and overall lower unit cash cost. Notably, Production volumes were 26% higher than last year and Midstream gathering volumes were up by 27%. As a result, adjusted EQT earnings, EPS and operating cash flow for 2014 were all up considerably over 2013 by any measure, although both years were impacted by some unusual items that should be considered when interpreting and comparing results. I will touch on a couple of these items in my comments, but I do refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release for more details.","Also, adjusted operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in 2014 was up considerably at 19% higher than 2013.","As I mentioned, we have several unusual items impacting earnings during 2014. In the second quarter, EQT completed an exchange of our Nora assets with Range Resources Corporation for 73,000 net acres in the Permian basin. We did record a $34 million gain at the time on that transaction.","In the fourth quarter of 2014, EQT recognized pretax impairment charges of $162 million on our Ohio Utica shale properties, where estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs, were significantly below our expectations; and also, a $105 million impairment on our Permian basin properties as a result of the decline in oil prices.","Also in the fourth quarter, EQT contributed $20 million to our charitable foundation.","Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted earnings were $0.96 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted EPS of $0.39 in the fourth quarter 2013. A significantly higher Production and Midstream volumes, once again, drove results.","Adjusted operating cash flow at EQT was $390 million in the fourth quarter compared to $314 million for the fourth quarter of 2013.","Our operational performance continued to be outstanding in the fourth quarter with 33% higher Production volumes than the fourth quarter 2013. We also realized 40% higher gathering volumes than last year and continued low per unit operating cost in both businesses.","Finally, in the fourth quarter, effective tax rate was actually negative as the full year 2014 effective tax rate of approximately 30% ended up lower than the 33%, which we had applied to the first 3 quarters of 2014. The lower full year rate resulted from several factors, including some state tax planning that was implemented in the fourth quarter. The continuing impact of blending and the growing nontaxable EQM partnership earnings are consolidated with EQT and low pretax income as a result of the impairments in the fourth quarter.","Now moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segment. I will limit my discussion to the full year results as the explanations for the full year, for the most part, apply to the fourth quarter as well.","So starting with EQT Production operating results. As has been the case for many years, now the big story in '14 at EQT Production was the growth in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was 26% higher for the year, driven by sales from our Marcellus wells. 2014 was our fifth straight year of more than 25% sales volume growth.","The EQT average realized sales price was relatively flat at $4.16 per Mcfe, and 14 -- about $0.04 lower than it was in 2013. For segment reporting purposes, of that $4.16 per Mcfe realized by EQT Corporation, $3.23 was allocated to EQT Production with the remaining $0.93 to EQT Midstream. The majority of this $0.93 at Midstream is for gathering, which averaged $0.73 per Mcfe.","I'd like to summarize a few changes that we made to our price reconciliation table, which should help in understanding the buildup of our realized price, which excludes noncash impacts. First, we applied the processing deduction directly to the liquid sales rather than averaging those deductions across all gas and liquids volumes.","And secondly, we moved the Btu uplift to the natural gas sale section of the table to reflect the fact that on average, our gas has a higher Btu content than the NYMEX spec, primarily as a result of ethane that is sold as methane. Because of that higher Btu value, we realized a higher price per Mcf at NYMEX, which is reflected on the table.","And then finally, we added an average differential line. The average differentials include the impact of local basis, recoveries received from selling some of our natural gas into higher-priced markets, recoveries from the resale of unused capacity and the impact of cash settled basis swaps. With these changes, it better explains the sales price that we received for our gas.","For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were 600 -- $867 million, excluding the impairment charges of 9% higher year-over-year.","Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, again, consistent with the significant production growth.","Moving now to the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 17% year-over-year, mainly as a result of the continued growth on gathered volumes and the subsequent entries in gathering total operating revenues. Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 41% year-over-year as a result of an increase in firm-contracted capacity.","Net operating expenses at Midstream were about 17% higher year-over-year, and that, again, was consistent with the growth in the Midstream business.","Finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $950 million in cash on the balance sheet, and that excludes cash on hand at EQM. Based on current commodity prices, we forecast approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow for 2015 at EQT, and that is, again, excluding the noncontrolling interest portion of adjusted EQM EBITDA.","So we expect to fund our roughly $2 billion, 2015 CapEx forecast, again, excluding EQM, with that expected cash flow and current cash on hand.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck to discuss the reduction in our CapEx forecast as well as today's reserve release.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Thank you, Phil. As you read in today's press release, we were lowering our 2015 CapEx budget by $450 million or 18% in response to the current economic environment. This consists of $425 million in EQT Production and $25 million in EQT Midstream. Of the $425 million reductions at EQT Production, $400 million is related to reductions in our drilling and completions budgets. We're reducing our Permian program to 5 wells, which were required to hold our acreage. And in the Marcellus, we are narrowing our focus to our highest-return Marcellus development areas. And the remaining $25 million reduction is in G&G and facilities expenditures.","These cuts do not assume any service cost deflation. While we expect to realize significant service cost reductions, we are currently in negotiations with all of our suppliers and do not want to forecast specific savings until those negotiations are concluded.","Moving on to our dry gas Utica well. As you know, we spud this county [ph] well in November. During the drilling of the curve, we encountered higher-than-expected reservoir pressures. Based on the pressures observed, we needed to significantly increase our mud weight. However, the mud system on the rig is not rated high enough for what's required to continue drilling. Therefore, we are now bringing in a rig with a higher-rated mud system, which has caused us to be behind our original schedule. We expect that rig to be on location toward the end of February. But despite this minor timing setback, we continue to be excited and optimistic about our dry gas Utica potential beneath our acreage.","Finally, I'd like to discuss our reserve report. This morning, we announced year-end 2014 total proved reserves of 10.7 Tcfe, with a 2.4 Tcfe or 29% higher than the previous year and represents a reserve replacement ratio of 590%. Extensions in discoveries totaled 3.3 Tcfe, which included 939 Bcfe of crude reserves from 220 wells that were unproved in 2013, but they were drilled and completed in 2014. This is consistent with the company's history of continuing to expand its footprint and develop areas that we believe to be economic even when they do not meet the SEC's definition of proved reserves.","Another piece of the 3.3 Tcfe of extensions in discoveries was 1.4 Tcfe of previously probable and possible reserves that we plan to drill over the next 5 years that were moved to proved undeveloped due to expansion of the geographic area classified as proved, longer-planned laterals and improved type curves.","Additionally, 954 Bcfe from new locations, primarily as a result of acreage additions, were booked as PUD reserves.","And one final comment on proved reserves, 790 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves were converted to crude developed in 2014 as a result of our drilling and completion program.","Our 3P reserves, or the total of proved, probable, and possible reserves, increased 6.4 Tcfe to 42.8 Tcfe, an 18% increase over the prior year. This increase was mostly in the Marcellus and does not include any dry Utica.","And finally, we are adjusting our guidance for our DD&A rate for 2015 to reflect the finalized reserve report. We now estimate our per unit DD&A to be $1.17 per Mcfe or $0.05 lower than 2014.","Also, as you see in our 10-K that we expect to file next week, our after-tax PV-10 was $4.8 billion, 22% higher than last year, driven by the increase in crude reserves. This reflects a NYMEX price calculating in accordance with the SEC requirements that was $0.70 per dekatherm higher than in 2013. However, a decrease in regional basis of $0.71 per dekatherm led to an effective wellhead price that was $0.01 lower than last year.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments.","David L. Porges","Thank you, Steve. Given the straightforward results for the fourth quarter, I will limit my prepared remarks to a discussion of our 2 announcements back on December 8, our 2015 operational forecast and our intent to form a second master limited partnership, or MLP. As you know, this is our first conference call since we've made those announcements, and we thought there might be some interest in hearing us elaborate on those topics as both pertain to our contemplated activities in 2015.","Let's cover the MLP first. Our intent with this new vehicle is that it will own EQT's general partner, or GP, interest in EQT Midstream Partners, or EQM, including the incentive distribution rights. And it will also own the $21 million EQM common units that are owned by EQT. EQT will be the general partner of the new MLP. And as a result, EQT will continue to operate both MLPs, a distinct advantage as we execute on our development plans.","Once EQM's 2014 Form 10-K is filed and the results are incorporated into the draft prospectus, we intend to file that document, the S-1, with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the first quarter. This will begin the iterative process of review by the SEC in response by us, so we hope to be ready for an IPO by about midyear, but the timing will depend upon that review process.","We do not believe that the rapidly growing GP cash flows are being fairly valued in the EQT stock price. As we reviewed our alternatives to rectify that situation, we concluded that we wanted to be a vehicle that was publicly traded; had favorable tax attributes, such as those offered by an MLP; retains effective operational control by EQT, as long as that seems optimal; and that would allow a tax-efficient separation from EQT should we decide to affect one in the future. To be clear, we do believe there are significant operational synergies between a midstream and upstream business during this time of rapid growth. We recognize that this period will not continue indefinitely, and we need to be quite comfortable, but the chosen structure would not preclude a tax-efficient separation should that become desirable.","As tied to the announcement, we received a few offline questions as to why we chose the MLP structure over the structure known as Up-C. We did give that latter structure significant consideration but concluded that the age of a significant portion of the EQM assets precluded favorable tax treatment offered by the Up-C structure. Also, we concluded after much in-depth discussion with tax experts that a tax-efficient separation was every bit as feasible for a standard MLP as for an Up-C.","Moving on to our operational forecast for 2015. You have read about the specific statistics in the December release and revisions in today's earnings release and heard more about this just now from Steve. What I would like to add in the discussion is more about our thought process, especially how it relates to our financial situation and philosophy.","As Phil mentioned, we ended 2014 with $950 million in cash at the EQT level and investment-grade rating from the 3 major rating agencies: 0 drawn on a $1.5 billion unsecured revolver; $200 million of Midstream EBITDA still owned by EQT Corp; our plan to drop our Northern West Virginia gathering assets to EQM in 2015; and proceeds expected from the previously discussed GP IPO. In that context, when we announced our budget in December, we were comfortable with a CapEx estimate that was about $1.2 billion higher than our operating cash flow estimate for 2015. Frankly, my expectation was that the GP IPO proceeds would not be touched in any of that. That money would remain in the bank account as of the end of 2015.","Since that time, the 2015 NYMEX strip for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs has declined significantly. Using current prices, we estimate that our operating cash flow for 2015 will be approximately $300 million less than we anticipated at the time of that release in December. As a result, we decided to lower our activity level to more than match the decline in operating cash flow. So if things play out as planned, we expect to end 2015 with significant cash on hand, nothing drawn on the revolver, et cetera. In other words, with this revision, our current expectation is that we will be in a better position from a financial liquidity perspective than we expected at the time of the December release.","In times of financial stress such as these, we think the prudent approach is to be conservative financially. Whatever happens over the course of the rest of this year from a financial perspective, quicker recovery or slower recovery, the presence or absence of opportunities created by overextended peers, et cetera, we believe we are better off with cash on hand, strong credit position and strong equity position.","In my opinion, it is too early in the cycle for us to know how this will play out. But no matter what happens, we are confident that having a strong balance sheet will create shareholder value. At the least, it feels good to know that we already have clear line of sight for funding robust, value-accretive drilling programs this year as well as, at least, the next couple of years.","I believe that our strong balance sheet will differentiate EQT during this low-price environment, as we will be able to continue to efficiently and profitably develop our acreage over a multiyear period and emerge from the cycle stronger than when we entered it.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Kane","Thank you, David. That concludes today's prepared portion of the call. David, can we please now open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets Canada","On the third quarter call, you guys have talked about it being most economical to develop the core Marcellus and Upper Devonian. That it's fast. It's practical and yet, midstream [indiscernible] commitment to support mid-20% growth for over the next couple of years, obviously, is the one that's changed since then. But I was just wondering if you could provide any update to the longer-term growth outlook and the reduction '15 CapEx, and whether you could provide a range of sensitivities such as at $4 gas, we can grow mid-20s. But with at $3 gas, I think it's more prudent to target a mid-teens growth rate.","David L. Porges","We're all looking at each other. We haven't actually gone through all of those sensitivities. It is fair to say that if we spend less, then the growth rates will be a little bit less. But frankly, we would still think that they would have approached the levels that we have talked about previously if the strip remains what it is at. I mean, it's -- at the current strip, you're probably looking -- you might be looking at more like mid to high teens for the next couple of years, but we have tried to position ourselves so that we could ramp up, as Steve mentioned, pretty quickly if need be. I mean, that's part of the benefit of having cut back more than cash flow would have dictated that we needed to. But we haven't really run through a variety of sensitivities in this kind of volatile market to give you a good answer to your question about what the growth rate would be at different NYMEX prices. Over the course of the next couple of months, we probably will run through those types of sensitivities, and certainly, we'll share those as we do.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. I know you guys haven't provided '16 guidance. But how would the reduced '15 activity plan impact your ability to ramp back up? I know you've always talked about there being a 9-month lag and spud to sale. So for 2015, should we think about that just taking the sequential run rate in the back half of the year extrapolating that into '16? Or is there the potential to ramp back up any increase in wells but could still impact '16?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes. Phil, this is Steve. Yes, we continue to have a fairly long lag time from TIL -- or from spud to TIL, that will continue. So what that means is most of the changes in '15's CapEx plan will affect 2016 production, and we've announced no impact on 2015. We'll maintain the ability to ramp up fairly quickly if the current price environment would approve and dictate that, that's a prudent thing to do. So we could change our plans fairly quickly. But given the plan that we just announced with the CapEx reductions, we think it's safe to say that we expect to be in the mid- to high-teens production growth in 2016. And again, if things improve and we can ramp back up, then that number would go up as well.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay, great. And then last question, has anything in the last couple of months, such as gas prices or land activity levels, changed your thinking on the GP valuation, which I think last quarter you expect at $4.6 billion. And I know there's a range based on terminal growth and the discount rates, but the publicly traded EQM LP units have actually been pretty resilient. I want to think that [ph] but I just want to make sure.","David L. Porges","Well, the -- our inside counsel who is in the room are staring at us with what feels like daggers, and they have -- they reminded us before the call that given that we've announced our intention to file a prospectus, an S-1, that we really shouldn't be commenting on such things. So I hope you will understand our reluctance to answer that question. I will comment that I think other people's GP opportunities have not necessarily been impacted by this if they're in a -- an area that has a favorable -- relatively favorable cost structure such as the Marcellus, Utica.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","I guess a couple of questions on my end, some were kind of hit on already. But you all mentioned that there were no assumed cost reductions in 2015 budget as of yet. I guess, number one, where are you? I guess, in the process ahead of those conversations, any indications around quantifying what those might look like? And then secondarily, to the extent they do come in, in a material -- how should we think about that as it relates to the capital budget? Should we expect you to accelerate with those excess savings? Or would that -- it sounds like maybe more likely accrued to the balance sheet.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Michael, we're right in the middle of that process. I can tell you, we have contacted all of our suppliers requesting a reduction, and we are starting now to get responses. And we're pretty happy with what we're seeing so far. But again, it's in the middle of the process, and we're hesitant to really comment in detail on it because we don't want that compromise any of our negotiations. But I think over the course of the next 3 or 4 weeks, we should conclude the bulk of that and have a better idea of exactly how much savings we expect to get.","Philip P. Conti","And given the -- to your question about spending the money, frankly, given our ample liquidity and forecast liquidity, getting extra money doesn't really affect our thought process. I mean, we will be making decisions about the pace of development as we look at the market more broadly, not based on having a few bucks. I mean, we've -- we're not uncomfortable at all. Because I think we've been saying ever since we started the drops of the MLP a couple of years ago, we are not at all uncomfortable with having extra cash in the balance sheet. We don't think that, that prudence has hurt us in the past. There's nothing about the market that makes us think that, that's not -- that, that's an inappropriate approach. So we're going to stick with that.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay, helpful colors. And then the kind of resale of excess term has helped you out in the last few quarters or several quarters. How long do you guys project having the ability to do that? Meaning like, do you eat up that firm in 2015 time period? Or is that something you'll have in your back pocket, if you will, through the course of 2015?","Randall L. Crawford","Michael, this is Randy. Certainly, we think that the capacity portfolio that EQT holds has value, value in the long run. And so we would expect that to continue for an extended period of time. But I would also point out that a great deal of the benefit that we're getting is our ability to get to further downstream markets and to pick up feel-better pricing as a result.","David L. Porges","So in other words, it's -- we're happy -- we're just as happy with the money that we get from selling our own gas into a premium market, as we would be to sell to right to move the gas, sell that right to somebody else. We still get the benefit. And of course, we continue to add capacity, basically, every year from now for the next couple or 3 years, 4 years.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. Yes, that's helpful. And then it might be something I need to wait for, but as it relates to the second MLP, I don't know if this has been discussed in the past or not, but is the intention -- like you said, you're alone on the GP on that, or maybe I'm ahead of myself, but is there an intention to have IDRs on that GP as well?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes.","David L. Porges","What was -- what if we...[ph]","Philip P. Conti","Now there's the -- the new -- the GP IPO, or the GP MLP will not have an IDR structure.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Compounding IDRs.","David L. Porges","Yes. The IDRs from the existing MLP end up in the new MLP. But they won't have a similar structure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You had mentioned that first Utica test and encountering higher pressure. Can you provide any color on just how much the pressure exceeded your initial expectations?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","What I'll tell you is we had the mud up to 18.7 pound per gallon mud, which indicates an extremely high pressure gradient. And we were several pounds per gallon below that.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And where was that well?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","That's in Greene County, Southwestern Pennsylvania.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And can you remind us where you're planning to drill the other tests in 2015?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","The next test will -- is planned for Wetzel County. And beyond that, it will depend on the results we see from the first 2.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So is it the idea to delineate primarily West Virginia this year aside from the Greene County well? Or is there a lot of potentially drilling tests in this first run within Pennsylvania as well?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I think it's going to be strictly dependent on what we find, so we have -- we don't have a lot of direct geologic data. So these are -- they are first tests, so we're going to gather a lot of data. And depending on what we see, we'll determine where we need to go. So first one, Southwestern Pennsylvania, second one, Northern West Virginia and beyond that will be determined by those first 2.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. Can you give us a sense of when we might get results from those first 2 tests?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well, I hesitate to say that given that these are exploratory wells, and as we've already seen, unexpected things can happen, so we expect to be back drilling the curve in the lateral on the first well in late February. So that should take a few weeks, and then we'll be fracking the well, so that pushes it out probably another month. But with these kinds of wells, it's hard to predict. So -- but in this early spring, we would hope to start getting some results.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And you might share those at that time or maybe it may depends on what you see?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes, I think it depends.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Steve, for you or the guys, wonder -- I know the production -- or I guess I should say the EBITDA cash flow guidance out there, I think you are assuming some differentials that were certainly a bit higher than what you've seen last quarter. Just want to know how you think about that. I think, as far as what you're thinking now on cash flow, I think you had for the quarter, I would call, what's roughly around $0.40-or-so differential. Just, I guess, your thoughts on 2 things. One, what are you kind of -- you're thinking about differentials here for the next, I guess, the remainder of this year? And how does that impact that cash flow or EBITDA?","David L. Porges","Neal, we have this in the press release that's under guidance. So the differential for the year, we're projecting at between negative $0.40 and negative $0.50. And for the first quarter, we expect it to be positive $0.10 to $0.15.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That -- I guess I understand that path. I mean, I think back in December, you're looking -- on a higher differential number, you had, I thought, virtually the same sort of estimate for cash flow. So it's like -- I guess what I'm getting at is just the difference between the -- the difference in the [indiscernible] differentials, the new change in production, is that what offsets this?","David L. Porges","No. The differentials is -- they were less than $0.05 better than in December, about $0.05 better. It's the NYMEX price that mainly is impacting the cash flow.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. You just make sense on that. I got you, I got you, okay. And then lastly, just on takeaway, you guys continue to do an outstanding job as far as being ahead of the curve there. I know versus some of your peers that still lack ample takeaway in the Utica. Just your thoughts, maybe for Steve or any of the guys, when -- I guess depending on the success of some of these dry gas Utica wells, is it suffice to say you'll have ample takeaways in that region if those come on as well?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Neal, I think it's a little early to really try and project, really, what's going to happen with dry Utica, given that we haven't even finished our first well. So I think we're going to hold off even commenting on that until we've got some test results and really can quantify what we think the impact of a success in the dry Utica might be.","Operator","Next question comes from Joe Allman with JP Morgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I know that this morning, you lowered your planned CapEx budget for 2015, but I just want to compare the new CapEx budget to what you spent in 2014. So if we're talking about just exploration and development, is your new CapEx budget for 2015 higher than what you spent for E&D in 2014? Or is it flat or lower? And what does that mean for where your rig count goes from here?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Joe, it is up a little bit. I don't actually have the number right in front of me, so we're checking on that to tell you how much. But it is an increase over '14.","David L. Porges","Yes. So '14 for development, we were at $1.7 billion.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","$1.85 billion this year.","David L. Porges","And $1.85 billion this year, so.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And so from here, does that mean an increase in rig count or?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well, the rig count, we -- for the bulk of the year, we expect to have 8 big rigs running and 4 topple rigs, so a total rig count of 12. I think we\u2019re currently at 15 as we stand today, but that will be ramping down here shortly.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then the reduction in CapEx, at least on the production side, I think your old budget was $2.3 billion, and now you're at $1.85 billion, so that's a 20% decline in CapEx. Your well count is down by 33% in the Marcellus and the Permian from what you plan in December. So could you just help me understand the -- why the CapEx drop is not proportionate with the well drop?","David L. Porges","Yes. There's a lot of CapEx that's -- for completing wells that we're spud last year. So you have a -- your CapEx, it goes against well spud against last year. And then wells are spud this year, there'll be CapEx associated with those that carry into next year as well. So it's very normal to have a disconnect there.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Remember that the majority -- the clear majority of what we spend on any well is spent after we've -- after the drilling rig itself has moved off the location. And yet our account is typically for spuds.","John J. Gerdes - KLR Group Holdings, LLC, Research Division","Right. But what's the inventory of wells that you drilled that you haven't yet completed as of December 31, 2014?","Philip P. Conti","[indiscernible] the release. We'll get back in a second. So we had 722 wells spud, and 531 of those were online at the end of the year. And then there's 23 that were complete, but not online.","Operator","Next question comes from Stephen Richardson from Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Richardson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","David, I was wondering if you could -- at risk of raising the ire of your General Counsel, I was wondering if you could talk about your comments about the tax-efficient separation potential of this new HoldCo? And are there any restrictions on -- are there any requirements on EQT -- C corp's ownership of this structure going forward?","David L. Porges","Yes, there will be with any of these things. It's not specific to our situation. But the requirements have more to do with how much kind of indirectly, I guess, you'd say, how much of the ownership of the underlying operating assets that we have. So that's -- it wouldn't be specifically EQT's ownership of this GP HoldCo. It would be more related to that ownership x the HoldCo's ownership of EQM. That would really be more of what would be looked through. So exactly how any such entity goes about optimizing that is kind of depends on the circumstances. We'd -- and we'll be taking a look of that. But that's really the issue. It's not the standard C corp, C corp, where you think about you need to add about 80% ownership, 80% -- and then -- and spend 80%, if that's what you're getting at. It's a much lower thresholds, but your requirements are tied to what that underlying -- the ownership of the underlying operating businesses.","Stephen Richardson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it, okay. And is there any -- as you think forward, acknowledging the synergies between these 2 businesses in the next couple of years, certainly, as you think forward to certainly building potentially the MVP pipeline, are there -- do you think there's a relationship between when the timing of this potential tax-efficient separation would come and the funding needs of EQM building new projects? Are those 2 issues related? Or are they independent? How do we kind of think about that in terms of timing?","David L. Porges","I haven't really thought that EQM's funding needs are necessarily related to that, so I would grant you, that given what we just talked about, the -- when you need more funding, that you too can get to the point where you'd dilute the parent company's ownership sufficiently that you'd say, \"Geez, you better make a move before you pass through that threshold.\" So certainly, that would -- that could factor into it. But there's a variety of ways that one could deal with it in the meantime. More broadly, but really just looking at what's the best way to create shareholder value for EQT shareholders. That's the governing issue. But the comment that you're making about EQM's ultimate growth is certainly a fair one. It does impact the -- that is one of the factors that one would look at.","Stephen Richardson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay. If I could follow up just a little quick one for Steve, the decision to cut back in the Marcellus. Can you talk a little bit about where you're going to be focusing activity? I would assume that this would be less C county drilling certainly and more Greene and Wetzel drilling in terms of the core program for '16. How do you balance that with what's going on with your processing margin and some of the issues right now in the NGL market in the Southwest? If you could just talk to that a little bit, it'd be useful.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I think you actually answered your own question. So our focus is definitely going to be in our core Southwestern Pennsylvania, Northern West Virginia areas. Until recently, the Northern West Virginia development has a slightly higher return in our Southwestern PA even though the Pennsylvania wells were a bit more productive because of the liquid uplift. The current liquids market, that's flip flopped a little bit. So the southwestern PA dry gas area is back on top with Northern West Virginia close second, but pretty much pulling back everywhere else. So yes, the C counties, no drilling and some of the step-out wells we were doing, especially some of the dry areas of West Virginia is where we're cutting back.","Operator","Next question comes from Cameron Horwitz with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Just a real quick question for me, does your production guidance bake in any expectation for production shut-in, in the next rollout period just due to pricing at all?","David L. Porges","No, we're expecting any shut-ins.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Hall, with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","I'm just -- I was curious as it relates to the 2015 plan in wells put on the production. Any guidance or on how many wells you would expect to put on production in 2015 average lateral length? And if there's any nuance as to the timing of those wells coming on given the trajectory coming out of 2014?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Michael, I don't have the specific numbers in front of me. But regarding the timing, I think you're likely to see production in the second and third quarters to sort of moderate a bit. So this year will be a first in 4 quarters it'd be where our growth has been. And if you look back over our history, you'll see that, that moves around. But we generally have a couple of quarters every year with bigger sequential growth than the other 2 quarters. This year is more likely to be first and fourth, sort of [ph] bigger increases, just based on the timing of our drilling plan.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you could maybe just expand a little bit on your comments earlier regarding the current liquids market fundamentals in West Virginia, and just how those have deteriorated a little bit since -- even just a month or 2 ago? I just wanted to see if you could expand on that maybe a little bit and then provide any insights into your NGL realization for 2015.","David L. Porges","We have a slide in our presentation that shows what's usually called the liquids uplift, and now we call it the liquids impact. Because essentially, the price that you get -- you still get a higher price per Btu for the liquids, but we take out the processing fee, you end up back at even with the gas price. So right now, they're being priced on par net of fees.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","But we're not experiencing anything any different than others. We just -- I mean, we have less wet gas, obviously, than some of our peers, so we don't -- the impact is more muted for us. So it's probably better, folks, for you to ask about that question. But -- so we don't have anything, really, to offer other than what you see in the market, which is that ethane prices are very weak, especially netted back to the wellhead, especially. And propane, because of the storage situation, is also quite weak. And there's a variety of takeaway projects that are in the market, that are just designed to mitigate some of that. But it's -- when oil prices have dropped as much as they have, it's really swimming upstream.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And I guess just the last question is, it looks like -- I look at your new February analyst presentation, the EQT gathering -- from EQT Midstream gathering CapEx has come down, probably 35%, 40% from your prior guidance. And so that's just related to fewer wells being drilled and potentially, fewer wells being brought online?","David L. Porges","That only came down by $25 million on a 2.5 -- $250 million budget, so it's about 10% reduction. And that just ties to gathering systems that were being built where the drilling that's been cut that we won't need it as soon.","David L. Porges","It refers to what Steve has talked about in the C counties and stuff like that.","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue at this time.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Porges, President and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Conti, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer; Randy Crawford, Senior VP and President of Midstream and Commercial; and Steve Schlotterbeck, Executive VP and President of Exploration and Production.","This call will be replayed for a 7-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 p.m. today. The telephone number for the replay is (412) 317-0088. The confirmation code is 10037715.

You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release under Risk Factors and in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed with the SEC, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are also on file at the SEC and available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2014 adjusted earnings attributable to EQT of $0.51 per diluted share or 7% lower than last year's third quarter. It should be noted that this quarter's effective tax rate was 33%, significantly higher than the 25% effective tax rate in the third quarter last year. The effective tax rate in the third quarter 2013 was favorably impacted by some onetime transaction adjustments. So normalizing for tax rates, adjusted EPS would actually have been about 6% higher year-over-year.","Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $291.3 million in the quarter or 5% higher than the third quarter of '13. Our operational performance was strong again this quarter, with 25% production volume growth and 24% higher gathering volume growth, while net operating expenses increased by only 8%, resulting in a cost reduction in per-unit operating costs.","EQT Midstream Partner results, as you know, are consolidated in EQT's results. EQT recorded $33.7 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling unitholders of EQM in the quarter, which was up significantly year-over-year due primarily to the sale of the Jupiter gathering system to EQM in May 2014 and the associated equity offering at EQM, which caused EQT's ownership of EQM to decrease to a little over 36%, down from almost 45% as of September 30, 2013.","EQT raised almost $1.2 billion from the sale of Jupiter, which will ultimately be reinvested in high-return projects, but this transaction does have the effect of reducing both the EPS and cash flow growth attributable to EQT in the short term.","You may have noticed in this morning's release that we included tables for adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating cash flow, all excluding amounts attributable to the noncontrolling unitholders. As the noncontrolling portion continues to grow, we believe this approach is more informative to investors.","The other significant negative impact to earnings and cash flow was a lower realized price compared to last year. At the consolidated level, EQT received $3.88 per Mcf equivalent compared to $4.12 last year. The average NYMEX gas price for the quarter was actually higher at $4.06 per Mcf compared to $3.58 last year, but basis was a negative $1.38 in the quarter 2014 compared to a negative $0.28 last year.","Our third-party gathering and transmission costs were $0.45 per unit or $0.07 lower than the third quarter last year, and we were able to recover $0.70 per unit in the third quarter 2014 primarily by transporting some of our gas to higher-priced markets and reselling our unused capacity via termed sales. That $0.70 per unit in recoveries this quarter compares to recoveries of $0.40 per unit in the third quarter of 2013.","The realized price of $3.88 includes a $0.26 per unit noncash hedge gain for hedge ineffectiveness and for derivatives that were mark-to-market in the quarter. The realized price at EQT Production was $2.94 per Mcf equivalent compared to $3.07 last year or a 4% decrease. EQT Midstream realized $0.94 compared to $1.05 last year as a result of lower average gathering rate. The operational results were again pretty straightforward in the third quarter, so I'll move right into the segment results.","Now starting with EQT Production. As I mentioned previously, the sales volume growth rate in the recently completed quarter was 25% over the third quarter of 2013. That growth rate continues to be driven by sales from our Marcellus and Upper Devonian plays, which contributed approximately 79% of the volumes in the quarter.","Operating income at Production was $105.7 million, excluding a noncash $34.3 million gain associated with the reduced hedge ineffectiveness in the third quarter of '14 or 12% higher than last year, excluding a comparable $3.4 million gain in the quarter last year.","As discussed already, realized gas prices at Production were lower in the quarter. In total, operating revenues at EQT Production, net of the ineffectiveness gain, were $328.8 million or 9% higher than the third quarter of '13. On the expense side, total operating expenses were higher as you would expect given the company's growth and totaled $223 point million (sic) [ $223.1 million ] or an 8% increase.","Moving on to the midstream results in the third quarter. Operating income here was up 19%. The increase is consistent with growth of gathered volumes and increase in fixed capacity-based transmission charges. Net gathering revenues increased 12% to $102.4 million in the third quarter '14 primarily due to a 24% increase in gathered volumes. The average gathering rate paid by EQT Production continues to decline as Marcellus production continues to grow as a percentage of our total production mix. Specifically, the average revenue deduction from EQT Production to EQT Midstream for gathering in the quarter of $0.74 per Mcf equivalent was $0.08 per unit lower than last year.","Net transmission revenues for the third quarter 2014 increased by $15.8 million or 40%, driven by fixed capacity charges and higher volumes associated with Equitrans expansion projects. Operating expenses at Midstream for the third quarter of '14 of $72.9 million were about $11.5 million higher than last year, consistent with our growth and increasing activity level at Midstream.","Just a quick note on guidance. We are estimating our operating cash flow for 2014 to be approximately $1.4 billion, excluding operating cash flow attributable to the noncontrolling EQM unitholders. We closed the quarter with no outstanding balance on EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility and over $1.35 billion of cash on our balance sheet, excluding the cash on hand at EQM. So we remain in a great position from both a liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint for the rest of the year and as we prepare for 2015.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.","David L. Porges","Thank you, Phil. Last week, we completed our annual strategic review with our Board of Directors. As is our norm during the third quarter call, I will use most of my time reviewing the main points of that discussion.","As you probably imagine, there are not a lot of material changes to our strategy. We continue to drive shareholder value by economically developing our vast resource base and investing in the ever-growing Midstream opportunity in our focus areas of Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia. There has been some evolution in the execution of our strategy that is worth discussing.","One overarching theme is the continued emphasis on reducing unit cost, unit operating cost, cost of capital, et cetera, in all aspects of our business. I'd like to focus on one aspect of this today, optimal pace of development.","First, we continue to believe that it is most economical to develop our core Marcellus and Upper Devonian acreage as fast as is practicable. But there are many factors that help determine that optimal pace, and these factors and constraints have shifted over the past 7 years or so since this play's early days. Through about 2010, the primary constraint for EQT was the availability of low-cost capital. We removed that constraint by redeploying proceeds from various monetizations to allow us to invest an excess of operating cash flow.","In 2011, we sold 2 midstream assets. In 2012, we created an MLP, EQT Midstream Partners, to allow the continued sale of assets without surrendering effective control of those assets. We still have about $2 billion of midstream assets at EQT, which will be dropped to the MLP over the next 2 years, assuming EQM's continued economic access to capital markets.","While a strong balance sheet may not be a differentiating attribute during times of capital availability, it can be very valuable when capital is scarcer. We're seeing some signs of that amongst our peer group and therefore want to ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. This influences our thinking regarding the timing of drops, amongst other things. Hence, our decisions to accelerate drops and also to shift more midstream CapEx to EQM.","Once we resolve the capital access constraint by monetizing assets, the constraint on optimal growth was set by the pace of clearing enough land for long lateral multi-well pads as we felt that was the most economic way to develop this asset. This year has been pivotable -- pivotal in resolving this constraint as we now clear pads well ahead of our drilling pace even though our emphasis on multi-well pads and long lateral stresses even the best of land groups.","This success, primarily as a result of fast-tracking acquisition of mineral rights adjacent to existing development areas, revision of drilling permits pertaining to pads under development and other measures, has come earlier than we expected. As a result, we decided to start increasing our standard lateral length earlier this year as part of ongoing efforts to further improve economic returns.","To give you an example. One pad cleared for 2015 drilling has 11 Marcellus wells averaging 5,700 feet, plus 8 Upper Devonian wells averaging 6,600 feet. That equates to over 115,000 pay -- of feet of pay and 770 stages on 1 pad. Now this approach does result in longer lead times between spudding a well and turning it in-line as it takes longer to both drill and complete wells with longer laterals. And that is what caused the modest reduction in the midpoint of our 2014 volume forecast.","However, from our perspective, the more important point is that this move to longer laterals results in a 6% reduction in cost per foot of pay and is consistent with that clear strategic driver to further reduce overall unit cost structure.","So having resolved the capital and land constraints, the current constraint to optimal development pace is takeaway capacity. We have seen this coming and have planned our midstream construction and firm capacity commitments to accommodate mid-20% per annum growth for the next several years.","Given that there is limited incremental takeaway capacity in the near term, our development plans over that time will be calibrated to allow us to fill the takeaway capacity, meaning that efficiencies that allow us to achieve the mid-20% per annum growth more economically, such as multi-well pads in long laterals, likely will result in achieving volume targets with fewer wells.","Of course, we keep adding to future takeaway capacity with projects like our Ohio Valley Connector, or OVC; and Mountain Valley Pipeline, or MVP, which are staged to provide takeaway capacity that facilitates such growth for many years.","Continuing on that theme, our midstream growth -- our midstream group has an ever-growing opportunity to provide gathering and transmission services in the Marcellus and Utica. Strategically, we think more and more of the midstream growth projects should be funded at EQM instead of being built at EQT and dropped.","Funding organic growth projects in that manner was probably always in EQM's best interest, but EQM was too small to wear this investment in construction projects. And frankly, EQT was able to profit from selling completed projects to EQM once they were built and contracted. With EQM's growth and high coverage ratio, it can afford to warehouse larger projects.","From EQT's perspective, now that the general partner, or GP, is receiving 50% of incremental cash flows, we create more EQT value by avoiding capital at the EQT level and benefiting from the GP than we do from expending that capital at the EQT level and recovering it in drop proceeds. Also, consistent with EQT's desire to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity, we would rather not warehouse such large midstream projects at EQT.","An example of this thinking was mentioned in the press release this morning that EQM is assuming EQT's interest in MVP. MVP will require a lot of capital in the coming years, but EQM now has the size to finance this project without compromising their distribution growth. This makes the project more economical for EQM unitholders, while EQT shareholders will benefit by an increase in GP value as a result of the higher number of shares outstanding and continued visibility in distribution growth.","As an example of this latter point, we updated our GP value estimate to account for both OVC and MVP. As Pat mentioned, that new slide is in the updated presentation on our website. The previous estimate for GP value, as you will recall, was $3.9 billion. Adding MVP adds over $0.5 billion in GP value, and adding OVC adds over $100 million in value. So with these 2 projects as the only changes to that prior estimate, the updated estimate is $4.6 billion. This same dynamic exists when examining the impact on GP value of other possible investments by EQM.","Now does EQT stock price reflect this GP value? It is impossible to be certain, but we think it is highly unlikely that it does. This fact, along with the growing GP value estimates, reinforces our view that we must do something else to highlight that value. All year, we have been saying that we are targeting sometime around year-end to make a final decision about what that is so that we can execute against that decision next year. We are still on that schedule. We will let you know as soon as we decide, but given that we are getting close to that decision, we think it best not to discuss the options in too much detail on today's call.","And I'm now going to turn it over to Steve to provide more color regarding our preliminary thinking about next year's development program.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Thank you, Dave. Building a bit on Dave's remarks, we're in the early stages in preparing our 2015 capital budget. Given the progress of our land group, we are entering 2015 in great shape from a cleared location perspective. As Dave mentioned, we're -- we've been successful at lengthening our average lateral length. For 2014, we expect our average Marcellus lateral length to be 5,820 feet versus an average lateral length of just over 5,000 feet in 2013. We expect to continue to be able to drill longer laterals in 2015.","In addition to lengthening our laterals, we're also drilling more wells per pad. In length -- in 2013, we averaged 7.6 wells per pad, and this year, we expect to average 11 wells per pad. All of this will translate into a slower increase in Marcellus\/Upper Devonian well count in 2015 compared to previous years while still achieving our growth targets as we are more focused on feet of pay drilled, not well count.","We plan to budget a few more dry Utica wells for 2015 to further derisk the play on our acreage as pure results continue to look strong. Keep in mind that if we are successful, the Utica wells will not increase our total production sales volumes for a few years. I've been asked what the impact of our development plans would be should the Utica be profitable. It's way too early to know for sure. But if the wells are more economic than the Marcellus wells, we would shift capital from Marcellus to Utica as we are committed to drilling the most economic wells.","With that, we'll open the call to questions.","Patrick Kane","Thank you, Steve. Maureen, could you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Say, maybe a question for -- a general question first for Phil or Dave. Just wondered, obviously, your liquidity position, certainly, is great out there right now. So wanted your thoughts, I guess, for you or even for Steve, on just acquisitions either for acreage or companies in general given that solid liquidity position you have.","David L. Porges","We are not letting money burn a hole on our pocket. I know I say that in every call when we get asked, but that's -- to me, that has -- the liquidity has no impact on whether an investment in acreage, say, would be attractive or not. I don't think it -- it doesn't take a financial guru to notice that the financial markets don't exactly embrace some of those acquisitions -- at least not for the acquirer. And I think that has been true over many years. Our mindset has not changed. We are not impacted by that, and I'll just -- I would just as soon leave it at that.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Does that include -- just I guess, I'm trying to think about how much acreage. Are you just still filling in acreage? Or do you see yourselves -- do you feel like you have enough acreage now, enough drilling locations that -- does that include acreage as well, I guess?","David L. Porges","I'll let Steve answer that.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well, Neal, I think we're always interested in acreage that fills in the holes in our core areas. So acreage that becomes available that fills those holes, is interesting. And probably more specifically, acquisitions where we have a competitive advantage in the bidding are the most attractive. So that typically happens when we have a lot of acreage that's immediately adjacent to the available acreage. So we continue to look for those opportunities, but they're not particularly common. So we'll go after them when they reveal themselves. But in the meantime, we'll just fill in holes as we can.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and 2 more. One, obviously, you continue to have huge dropdown opportunities. Do things -- I guess, when you think about how quick in the schedule of the drop-downs, do things just have to get sort of to critical mass before you decide to drop down? Or how do you all decide on sort of timing of these dropdowns sort of going through next year?","Philip P. Conti","We always are preparing for the next drop, and there's work that has to be done getting the contracts in place, getting the accounting right, et cetera. Our bias has been to do at least one drop a year. So we're always sort setting a goal to have one ready within a year of the last one or even sooner if we can. So I guess, the answer is we're always trying to get ready to do the next one because we think that's the right place for those cash flows to exist and get value at the lower cost of capital.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe, Dave, for you -- Dave. Thanks, Phil. Just wondered, you made a comment about limited takeaway capacity just in the near term, so doing more multi-pads and such. Is that -- can you just maybe discuss that a bit more? I mean, how much more -- to me, when I look at that capacity, it doesn't seem limited very long. Maybe if you can maybe comment about that, how that's going to grow.","David L. Porges","No, but that's all it -- it's just not a very good use of capital to be even a few months ahead of takeaway capacity. That's all, Neal. And then you...","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Very, very good.","David L. Porges","Right. You don't -- you just don't want to be spending that money if you don't have to. And a lot of times, you wind up with drilling rigs and frac crews that are on longer-term contracts. We think it's one of the most economic things that we've done is to make sure we have a lot of that stuff under long-term contract. And you want to make sure that you're carefully planning that so that you're not getting the one too far out in front of the other.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question just on differentials. I know just looking at your slides, such as on the Jupiter, you have a lot of firm gathering and compression agreements coming up. Your thoughts about, I know you highlighted or estimated what you thought different diffs would be for this quarter. Would you add any more hedges here? Would you add more FTE here? Just your thoughts given what's going on with basis differentials in your region.","David L. Porges","Yes. I'm not sure if I got a great answer. Randy, you may have a comment on it. We're always looking at the hedge portfolio, I'll tell you that. And we're always looking for a better -- broadly a sales portfolio that exposes us to higher-priced markets in the most economic manner. But if you're -- you're looking for nearer-term assessments?","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So Dave, would you lock in more firm transportation today or at the prices that FTE cost, not necessarily? I guess that's kind of where I was going with that.","David L. Porges","It all depends on the market. I mean, we think a big advantage that we have in having a commercial group as well as a midstream group, as well as Production, is that we can develop our own view of what it costs to move from point A to point B, say, with a pipe. And that we can develop our own view of what we think the market is going to be, what the difference is going to be between point A and point B. And if you think it's more economical to take out capacity, then you'd be open to doing that. I certainly think that we're in a good situation now. Of course, we've got a variety of -- we've got even more capacity coming on in the fourth quarter as it is. But I don't know that we'd be looking to take on any more than what we've been planning to take on at this point. One -- the big -- a big variable, and I know Steve has alluded to this in the past, is what does happen with the Utica? And that could change some thinking. But the way we -- I think we're reasonably comfortable with where we are right now.","Operator","Our next question is Drew Venker, Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you could provide some color on the assumptions on that dropdown figure you provided.","Patrick Kane","Basically, it's -- we have -- in round numbers, 2 assets [ph] still owned by EQT. And assuming 10x multiple, which is kind of a little bit less than what we've dropped recently, that's about $2 billion. So that's the only 2 assumptions there.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Pat. And just wanted to clarify what you're trying to say in terms of shifting capital to EQM for the midstream side. Is it kind of implying you would be spending more on the E&P side next year and in the next few years?","David L. Porges","No, that actually -- all that meant to -- that was not meant to imply that we're spending more on E&P next year. That's just meant to imply that the best with -- especially with us moving up to the 50% splits for the GP, that when we've run through the numbers, we think the most economical thing for EQT and, for that matter, for EQM is to have more of those projects built at EQM. It's purely a cost of capital decision. It's not a capital availability issue. It's that -- back in the earliest days, we were able to spend X on a project at EQT and then drop it for maybe 2x X because EQM was at such a size that they really couldn't wear in construction projects or projects that haven't been contracted out. So they will -- EQT basically derisked that. And the GP wasn't taking away that much from the LP. Now that we're into the 50% splits, it means that the price that EQM can afford to pay is probably a little bit lower, but EQT makes up a lot of value on the GP, so it's really -- it winds up being win-win to have more of those projects be built at EQM. I do think you should assume that as you look out, I don't want to pick the number of years, but 2, 3 years into the future, you'll basically see all of the midstream CapEx for the consolidated group being spent at the EQM level. I mean, I guess you never want to say never to new projects. But directionally, our view will be, because of those factors I mentioned. Again, it's the size of EQM that allows them to do it, and the fact that EQT is actually picking up more value from the GP than it does from build and drop, you should see that capital -- those projects moving towards EQM as opposed to EQT. Does that -- I'll take another shot if that wasn't clear enough.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, that helps, Dave. I just -- I think maybe just to follow up, does it -- so does your development plan for 2015 largely depend on logistics and planning and, I guess, all the things you normally take into account?","David L. Porges","Yes, yes, that's exactly right.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Versus running as hard as you can?","David L. Porges","That's exactly right. Incidentally, one thing we'll probably -- we can -- we'll ponder doing is if the understanding on the thought process behind the CapEx being spent at EQM versus EQT -- we've actually done internally a fair amount of analysis on that. We'll see if we can't figure out a way to capture that in a way that -- such that we can communicate it numerically to investors. But it is not a capital availability issue.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Dave. Assuming you could provide some clarity or some more color on how much of those third-party recoveries are attributable to selling unused capacity versus just moving gas around to higher-price markets? Like kind of how we should try to forecast that in the future because it's more...","Patrick Kane","I think for forecast, so there's 3 things, 3 main things in that recovery line. One is we do have firm capacity to get to higher-priced markets. So that's a big part of it. We also have some of that capacity that we're not using for our own volumes that we resell. That's the second part. And thirdly, in the -- say, the typical 12 months or shorter, we do have fixed -- firm sales where we set the basis at the time of the sale. So on those contracts, if basis widens after we enter the contracts, the recovery goes with it because the basis has been set. So that's what's in that line item. Just given that, that -- those tend to be shorter-term, the best way to model recovery going forward is if you look at our sales points, which we have in our analyst presentation on Slide 44, and do a weighted average of the pricing that you get compared to the local price, that should approximate your recovery line.","Operator","Our next question is Christine Cho from Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Would you be able to break down the 2 Bcf a day on MVP between producers and end users?","Randall L. Crawford","No, Christine, we're not providing the breakdown of customers at this point.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Then do you have any insight in what the shippers are planning to do with the gas once it gets to Transco? Just because my understanding is that I thought Transco was full, so have most of them signed up for capacity on Transco? Or is there some sort of dynamic going on with capacity releases and such that doesn't make it necessary to sign up for FTE on that pipe?","Randall L. Crawford","Sure, Christine. I think that MVP does provide a lot of supply diversity to Station 65 and currently supplied by Transco, as you mentioned. Certainly, that the -- generally speaking, our experience has been that when you're creating a new interconnect to existing interstate lines with a market needs -- and with any market, it needs to create capacity, such as when they had Cascade Creek, TETCO's TEMAX expansion and such. So basically, the market that is in need of that gas has the existing capacity on Transco. They'll purchase the gas at 165 or a Zone 5 pool and transport the gas on the capacity that it owns. So it's important to remember, okay, that the pipeline, which is an open-access pipeline, doesn't control what happens to the gas that's shipped on 165 as the shippers on that pipeline own the capacity. So essentially, the shippers will -- that significant amount of gas crosses that meter and takes away at 165. So those shippers that already exist and have capacity on Transco will be able to access that liquidity and that supply. So those shippers that have capacity will be able to move it at that point.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But I guess if you're adding 2 Bcf a day to that interconnect, I mean, what was the capacity at Station 65 before that? I would just think that it's like it would overwhelm a little bit. Would it not?","Randall L. Crawford","No, not in our judgment. I think that, significantly, right now, Transco Zone 5 [ph] Currently imports about 4 Bcf of gas per day with the majority that's flowing from the Gulf Coast. And with over 3 Bcf a day that's consumed at Zone 5 Station 165, that's significant volume flowing through the meter. So it has -- so MVP will have shippers who have access to this liquidity, and they can sell them to the existing shippers -- or new markets, which will be developed over the 4 years, that will develop their coal retirements in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and such. So essentially, our experience in the development of the Marcellus, similarly, such as the taps that have gone into Tennessee at Mawa and Algonquin, the Texas eastern taps and such. So you've got a market in need of a supply, and this will provide a reliable source of supply to a growing Southeast market. So we're -- the market has really validated that assumption with the shippers signing, and I think that's -- certainly, there'll be significant liquidity ahead for shippers on MVP.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Oh, great. Okay. And then I know in the press release, you guys talk about the size of the pipe diameter, and total capacity is yet to be determined. But kind of on that GP slide, it implies that the pipe is going to cost $1.9 billion. Is that a good number to start with for us?","David L. Porges","Yes, but you're looking at the EQT share, just so you know.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, yes, yes, I know.","David L. Porges","Yes.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's a good number?","David L. Porges","That's not a bad assumption.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then you're talking about in 2 years, you would like all of the midstream CapEx to take place at EQM. I know that the big pipeline projects that you've been contemplating, it's taking place at EQM. But they're still gathering that's taking -- gathering construction that's taking place at EQT, and I think the rough rule of thumb in the past has been 20% of E&P CapEx. Is that -- like when should we think that, that starts to transition over?","David L. Porges","It's -- I would think you should -- you should look at that as beginning to transition over.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right now?","David L. Porges","And I didn't mean to make it so specific as suggesting that in 2 years there won't be any [indiscernible] At EQT. But I'd say you should assume that, that transitioning is beginning, and that, yes, we are talk about that capital also, not just the big projects like the OVCs and the MVPs.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then your peers in the Marcellus that do infrastructure up there, a lot of those guys also -- a lot of them do processing as well. So do you think that takes away from your third-party gathering opportunities? If they can go to someone else to do gathering and processing, whereas with you, they can only do gathering. Can you kind of and talk about that?","David L. Porges","Randy might have a view. I actually don't think so, because at least the main processor we deal with here, often has said they would prefer not to have to do as much gathering.","Randall L. Crawford","And I think, Christine, from a customer perspective, I think an example of that is the Mobley processing facility that MarkWest has placed on the Equitrans system. So really, providing producers a complete solution to get their gas processed and having a residue solution, moving the dry gas, which we have been very successful in doing, I think the combination of those 2 makes us very competitive in the marketplace.","David L. Porges","And it's only -- we're more than happy to work in conjunction with other midstream companies, just as we're more than happy to work in conjunction with other producers.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for me. Can you break down the NGL volumes between Marcellus and Permian?","Philip P. Conti","I will turn it to Pat.","Patrick Kane","No, with -- I don't have that with me, Christine. If you would just follow up, we'll try to get that.","Operator","Our next question is from Holly Stewart, Howard Weil.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe just digging into Christine's question a little bit more on the gathering CapEx at the EQT level, I think we've backed into, call it, $240 million or so in 2014, so -- that's excluding transmissions. So just I guess bigger picture, assuming that, that starts to decline pretty significantly in 2015 and beyond?","David L. Porges","It starts to decline in 2015. We haven't set the budget yet. And frankly, one of the things we have to figure out for '15 is to the extent that the projects have been committed to already, it may wind up being more problematical to transfer it at that -- in the middle of the project, right? There tends to be -- even on the gathering, there's a lead of at least several months in putting it in place. So I'm not at this point ready to put a number out for 2015. I was providing much more of a kind of strategic overview on that.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Strategic big picture, okay.","David L. Porges","But you should assume that number that you're talking about starts trending towards 0.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, got it. And then maybe just, Steve, as you mentioned, kind of thoughts around 2015, anything that we should think about as a shift in the development plan, whether it's within your different areas?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","No, I think we haven't finalized our plan yet. So we don't even have specifics internally. But I think you'll see a continued focus on our core areas of the Marcellus will attract the bulk of our investment capital next year. There'll be no change.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, okay, great. And then -- I mean, and Pat, maybe you talked about this a little bit just in terms of this third-party gathering and transmission recovery line. I mean, it looks like you blew away your 3Q guidance for that. And your 4Q guidance is a lot better than even what you've realized in the first quarter. I assume it's very seasonal with 1Q and 4Q. So can you just kind of help us better understand how you're getting to those numbers?","Patrick Kane","Yes, it's -- I think the blowing away the guidance, if you look at the basis realized in the third quarter compared to where it was when we gave the guidance, it was wider. And the biggest chunk of the improvement in the recoveries had to do with these fixed sales that we had the -- basically the recovery moved up penny for penny with the basis. And you're right, it is seasonal. So fourth quarter, the big improvement there is that we do expect winter again, and that will help.","David L. Porges","So a big part of that then is just not being as exposed to the basis as possibly, I guess, our earlier ways of presenting it might have made it seem.","Operator","Our next question is Joe Allman, JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one question on the longer laterals. Could you quantify what happens to the longevity of the drilling inventory as you move over to drilling more longer laterals?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well, I think it probably is unchanged given the fact that we're going to drill -- we have a set amount of capital. So we'll drill less wells, but the same number of lateral feeds, so develop the same amount of acreage in either case. So there's a capital efficiency improvement, but I think it doesn't really impact our -- the length of our inventory.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So how many longer laterals could you do? So for example, if you -- if any given area, you had say a 10-year inventory of drilling, do you think you could drill longer laterals in pretty much all your acreage? Or is it going to -- is it on 1\/2 your acreage or 1\/4 of your acreage? Then if you had a 10-year inventory of drilling, I'm assuming that inventory goes down to say 7 years, just because you have fewer wells, but they're longer wells.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","No, the -- I think you -- the way to think about it is how much acreage are we developing? And that's driven by the factors that Dave mentioned. Used to be driven by capital and land. Now for the next couple of years, by capacity. So we will drill -- we'll develop the same amount of acreage. We'll just do it with less wells because they're longer laterals. But inventory is really about acreage, not well count. So I guess if you want to just think about it as well count, which is not how we think about it, the well count will go down, but the available acreage and the growth opportunity is unchanged. It's just more capital-efficient.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And how widely could you drill the longer laterals? On -- what percentage of your wells could be longer laterals?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well, that's hard to answer. One, longer than what? But it's very acreage-dependent, and it's very dependent on our ability to add acreage adjacent to our current acreage, to swap with our competitors to build blockier positions. So there's numerous factors that go into that. I would say, we expect to be able to continue to drill laterals as long as we're drilling now, on average, for the next few years. And we hope to be able to lengthen them further, but we think we can replicate what we're doing now for a while.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on takeaway, when you compare yourselves to other operators in the Marcellus and the Upper Devonian, what advantages do you think EQT has versus others in terms of takeaway and price realizations?","David L. Porges","Well, I'll -- yes, I'll just go back. I'll give my 2 cents on it, and if Randy or Steve wish to volunteer something, or Pat, that's fine as well. I come right back to thinking that the main advantage we have -- and look, I think a lot of these peers are very good companies. So I don't -- I certainly do not mean for any of this to come across as being critical. But if we just look at ourselves, we'd say we get a benefit from this factor I had mentioned on an earlier -- in answer to an earlier question, about having a better, more detailed knowledge of how much it actually costs to build the takeaway capacity to go from, say, point A to point B and to be able to compare that to what the prices are in the market. We -- as a result of a lot of these activities, we have a pretty good idea of what other projects are out there as well and a notion of how that's likely to impact that basis differential between those locations over the course of time. So we've got a sense of what projects we think make sense over time and which ones make less sense over time. Beyond that, of course, we do get a benefit from the fact that we have built a lot of the gathering here. So a lot of the gathering necessarily goes through our Equitrans system. Equitrans is feeding the MVP project, et cetera. Randy, you have any thoughts?","Randall L. Crawford","Yes. I would just add that -- at EQT that we've been, from a first mover standpoint, from the fact that we were in the Huron and moving the importance of FTE, that the contracts that we have entered into are economically sound. They access a broad portfolio, an excellent commercial group, and we're getting to a variety of different markets. And so the fact that we have stepped up our team [ph] '14 [ph] Capacity is coming on in November, that will access both the Gulf Coast and the Northeast market. So we have consistently at EQT been proactive in procuring firm transportation to the valued markets that David said. And I think our track record speaks for itself.","David L. Porges","So look, none of the peers who are roughly our size have their head in the sand on this. Everybody that we're aware of is aware and has been aware that they need to be focused on takeaway capacity. I mean, I understand there's been a couple of cases where folks maybe didn't have as much for whatever reason. Actually, if you -- the -- if your credit rating isn't as good, maybe it's harder to get some of the firm transport, the terms that you would like. But generally speaking, I think our -- the peers who are more or less our size are all very and have been very focused on this issue.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then lastly, in terms of options for the GP, is doing nothing -- is that still an option that you might disclose at year-end? And could you disclose what the most viable options are that you're pursuing at this point?","David L. Porges","I guess I'd say in theory, it's an option because I don't really want to go into details. But I don't know that, that would be a -- if I were in your shoes, I'm not sure that that's the inference that I would be drawing from the comments that we've made.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Could you talk about the most viable options that you are pursuing?","David L. Porges","I've got 2 lawyers in the room staring at me. So is that an answer enough?","Operator","This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Kane for any closing remarks.","Patrick Kane","Thank you, Maureen, and thank you, all, for participating.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, a 42% decrease from EPS in the first quarter 2011. The first quarter of 2012 included $6.2 million of expense associated with the retroactive portion of newly enacted Pennsylvania legislation imposing an impact fee on all wells drilled in the state including those wells drilled prior to 2012. In addition, there were two items that cumulatively added $36 million to our pre-tax income in the first of 2011 which distort the year-over-year comparisons.","Adjusting for those three items, EPS was $0.50 this year compared to $0.60 in the first quarter last year or a 24% decrease. The decrease in EPS comes as a result of lower natural gas prices on our un-hedged production, lower operating income at Equitable Gas as a result of unusually warm weather, and higher depletion rates at production. All of which more than offset another solid operational quarter including record produced natural gas sales and another record in gathering volumes. Operating cash flow which adjusts for those 2011 non-cash items as well as the non-cash impact of higher depletion rates decreased by 9% to $227 million for the quarter.","With that, I will go into a little more detail by business segments starting with EQT production, which continues to generate impressive growth in sales of produced natural gas. The growth rate was 26% in the recently completed quarter over the first quarter of 2011. That growth was primarily organic and was driven by sales from our Marcellus shale play, which contributed nearly 50% of the volumes in the quarter.","As I mentioned, gas prices were lower in the quarter. The realized price at EQT production was $3.59 compared to $3.97 last year. At the corporate level, EQT received $4.84 per Mcf equivalent or 11% less than last year. Produced liquids excluding ethane accounted for 6% of the volumes and 34% of the un-hedged revenues in the quarter.","Total operating expense of EQT production was higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, production taxes, and SG&A. The increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to an increase in cost to drill and complete wells, the removal of some proved reserves due to lower natural gas prices at year end, and the suspension of drilling activity in the Huron play.","As alluded to earlier, in February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed a natural gas impact fee. The legislation, which covers a significant portion of EQT\u2019s Marcellus shale acreage, imposes an manual fee for a period of 15 years on each well of drilled. The impact fee adjust yearly based on three factors, age of the well, changes in the consumer price index, and the average monthly NYMEX natural gas price. Production taxes increased primarily due to the $8.2 million accrual in the first quarter of 2012 for this impact fee. Again, $6.2 million of that represents the retroactive portion of the fee for pre-2012 Marcellus wells.","Moving on to Midstream business, operating income here was up 10% versus last year excluding the impacts from the sale of the Langley processing complex and the Big Sandy Pipeline, and a reduction of non-income tax accruals in 2011. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity based transmission charges. Gathering net revenues increased by $10.3 million as gathering volumes increased by 21% while the average gathering rate declined by 4% driven by the Marcellus mix.","Transmission net revenues decreased by 13% to just under $23 million, resulting from the loss of revenues associated with the Big Sandy Pipeline, which we sold in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the Big Sandy revenues, transmission net revenues increased by 24%.","Storage marketing and other net operating income was down about $6 million in the first quarter. These results included $5.4 million in unrealized losses related to our storage inventory and a steeper slope in the front end of the near term natural gas curve. Because we have financial hedges associated with those inventories, we expect to have unrealized gains that will offset these unrealized losses over time. Given current market conditions, we estimate that full year 2012 net revenues in storage marketing and other will be approximately $50 million to $60 million.","Net operating expenses at Midstream were slightly higher quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of the previously mentioned non-income tax adjustments. For unit gathering and compression expense, again, excluding the non-income tax adjustments was down 7% to $0.28 per Mcf equivalent as a result of higher throughput while maintaining our cost structure.","And then finally, on the Midstream on February 13, 2012, EQT Midstream Partners' limited partnership filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as we move forward on forming an MLP.","Moving on to distribution, operating income, distribution was down 31% versus the first quarter last year. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA, the first quarter of 2012 was the warmest first quarter period on record in the service territory for Equitable Gas, 24% warmer than last year when measured by heating degree days. As a result, total net operating revenues for the first quarter 2012 were 19% lower, while operating expenses were down slightly excluding the prior year tax adjustments. Basically for each 100 heating degree day change in weather going to winter at Equitable Gas, our distribution margins change by about $2 million. So, the warmer weather in the quarter negatively impacted our EPS by about $0.05 per share versus normal weather and about $0.06 per share versus last year.","Moving on to 2012 guidance, today, we reiterated our production sales forecast for full year 2012 of between 250 and 255 Bcf equivalent or 30% higher than last year. Our forecasts are intended to represent our realistic projection factoring in some negative impacts from inevitable unplanned delays or disruptions such as delays in Midstream projects, permit delays, weather impacts etcetera. As a result of the lower forecast of natural gas prices for our un-hedged volumes, we are decreasing our operating cash flow estimate for 2012 to approximately $800 million. At the same time, as a result of our lower well cost estimates, we are also lowering our 2012 CapEx estimates by $100 million to $1.365 billion.","We exited the quarter with $745 million in cash on the balance sheet, no short-term debt including no cash frauds under our $1.5 billion credit facility. And so we remain in a great position as far as liquidity growth for 2012.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.","David Porges \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer","","Thank you, Phil. As we have previously communicated, our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing this, the monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities while living within our means is also unchanged.","Our tactics, however, can and must change when circumstances warrant. In an environment in which natural gas prices are down sharply, we have already made tough decision, but you have January suspension of Huron drilling cutting CapEx by about $130 million.","We are focusing our drilling on our highest return opportunities with nearly 75% of our 2012 Marcellus wells being drilled in either our highest EUR areas or in the more liquids-rich portion of our West Virginia acreage. With the liquids uplift, the returns of the West Virginia wells are similar to more prolific dry gas wells in Pennsylvania. There is always a lag between making such decisions and having those changes show up with a cash register, but we are getting some immediate benefits from reducing our service cost as gas prices are declining. The cost of a 5300-foot well is down to $6.1 million from $6.7 million last year mainly due to those reductions. This will impact our 2012 CapEx, but will now show up in our depletion rate until next year just as last year's increases hit this year's depletion.","Our online after-tax IRR estimate is now 29% at the current NYMEX five-year strip of 366 per MMBtu and 25% at a flat $3 NYMEX. Therefore, it is clear to us that investments in our Marcellus play remain attractive even at current prices. So, they are obviously not as attractive as they would be in higher prices. We believe that prices will begin moving up once the current storage balance is worked off, however, (the long) that takes, but are structuring our business, so that they can thrive in an environment, which prices never get above, where say the back end of the curve currently sits. Practically, this means that we will continue to prioritize our spending rigorously and focus on improvements in cost structure whether they come from different ways of doing things or reduction at service costs. So, this heightened focus has already resulted in some reductions in activity level, notably the Huron decision.","I do want to reiterate what Phil mentioned about the volume guides for the year that is the fact that our growth versus same quarter last year is below our annual guidance, is not a result of changes in activities rather it's just the nature of the business given multi-well pads, large compressor stations, etcetera. Note, this is little lumpy. We also note that the three higher sequential growth rates in EQT's history in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first two quarters of 2011. So, the current comparisons are a little tougher than they will be later in the year. As for cash flow, we are aware that projections are lower than they were a few months ago due largely to decline in natural gas prices, but the reduction in well cost keeps our CapEx forecast in line with this lower cash flow even at a constant activity level. We will, of course, continually monitor market conditions and adapt our tactics accordingly.","In 2012, we are investing our operating cash flow plus also utilizing some of our other available capital. This other capital includes cash from our investment grade debt issuance completed in late 2011 and further monetizing Midstream assets by forming in MLP. As Phil mentioned on February 13, 2012, we filed the initial S1 for the MLP, but we recognize that this nearly starts the review process with the SEC. To remind you, the advantages of EQT shareholder \u2013 to EQT shareholders of forming an MLP includes, maintaining operational control of where, when, and to what specs gathering is built, access to an ongoing source of low cost capital, and participation in any MLP distribution growth. Of course, a publicly traded currency would also provide a market view of the value of the MLP's assets.","Moving on to some other operational matters, as we told on the last call, Mark West is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. This plant was originally scheduled to be up and running by mid-year. However, due to a number of delays that they experienced in permitting and construction, the project is now scheduled to be complete in the first quarter. We are looking into work arounds that would improve on this, but believe that we will meet our production sales volume targets even with the current schedule. The real impact of this is not on the overall volumes, but rather that additional margins from the revenue uplift expected from liquids extraction FF plant will obviously being delayed somewhat.","We are also working to a short adequate processing and transportation capacity to support our Marcellus growth beyond this year. We were an anchor tenant taking 150,000 dekatherms per day on Spectra Energy's Texas Eastern Pipeline expansion to Eastern Pennsylvania and Mid-Atlantic markets, plus 150,000 dekatherms per day of backhaul runs. The expansion is expected to be complete by the end of 2014. And we are in the process of securing additional processing capacity to enable further growth from our wet Marcellus acreage.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource via accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and they are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will say disciplined and live within our means investing our available cash from operations and from future monetizations as appropriate. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate we\u2019ll continue to.","Patrick Kane \u2013 Chief Investor Relations Officer","Thank you, Dave. That concludes the comments portion of the call. (Emily), can we please now open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","","Good morning guys. First, guys can you address maybe just a different source that you are seeing going forward? And then secondly as you sign \u2013 you talked about the MarkWest deal that likely signed up, how do you perceive sort of the infrastructure costs going forward if that deal was successfully completed?","David Porges","So, we talk about ones, changes going forward, you are talking about on the infrastructure side?","Neal Dingmann -- SunTrust","Correct.","David Porges","Randy, you want to comment on where you see infrastructure heading?","Randy Crawford","","Well, with respect to the pricing, we haven\u2019t seen a great deal of softening in the market from that standpoint, but in terms of the projects, EQT is working towards, we continue to be on time, on budget with our Sunrise expansion and in building up the infrastructure that connect to the plant. And as Dave alluded to we are looking in the interim to other options as well to move, to get our gas process.","David Porges","We are obviously going to see average gathering rates decline even in the constant cost environment just as the mix continues to move towards the Marcellus, but we've mentioned in the past that the unit rates for Marcellus are roughly half that for Huron. So, as the mix keeps moving we will continue to see average declines even without a \u2013 because of mix change along.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","","Okay. And then just kind of going forward one last question just on the improved sort of techniques you are continuing to see, as far as what are you seeing that as far as opportunities why, just on a percentage, does that continue to expand and maybe cost that you see on that going forward. Are you able to as you continue to do more of these new processes, bring down the cost a bit on that completion?","David Porges","Yeah, I think you\u2019re talking about production. So, I will turn that over to Steve.","Steve Schlotterbeck","","I assume you are speaking about completion techniques in particular?","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","","Yeah, exactly, Steve.","Steve Schlotterbeck","","Yeah. Well, we continue to really feel good about the results we are seeing with the new frac techniques specifically in the more brittle areas like we talked about. I think roughly 44% of our program this year we expect to use the new technique. And I think that benefits pretty well from the reduced service costs we are seeing. So, that\u2019s been a big benefit as well that the cost for that new technique could come down along with the overall costs.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","","And then when your peers talked about just the tighter denser space, I mean, is that something Steve that also that you are looking into and do you assume, it look like that they talked about increase rates based on that, is that something that you\u2019re looking at doing as well?","Steve Schlotterbeck","","Well, I guess I would say we pioneered that.","David Porges","Yeah, that\u2019s what we are talking about. Yeah, that's what we are talking about, year and a half.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","I guess, what I'm asked to Steve is as you continue to sort of on these specs do that, is that going to be basically majority, I mean right now it's still I don\u2019t know what percent of your total program that is. I am just wondering if that will become sort of more mainstream here in the next letter part of this year for you?","Steve Schlotterbeck","","Well, I think we still believe that it\u2019s going to be location specific based on the brittleness of the rock. And our current estimate is that for 2012, 44% of our 132 wells will use that technique.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","","Well, okay.","Steve Schlotterbeck","In some of the cases, in certain pricing environment, it doesn't make sense and other pricing environment it does make more sense. So, depending on where natural gas prices go, there is kind of a gray area either somewhere it just seems that it basically always make sense. Others were basically seems that it never make sense so, on some place where it's little bit more sensitive to current economics. So, you can see that percentage moving up of that. Though, I would say and I think I look at the things that folks are doing. They keep working on ways to come up with the optical completion technique for each of those \u2013 for each of the areas on which we are working, whether it's the tighter spacing, which again we've been talking about for a \u2013 that's what we are talking about now, we talk about (specs) that's what we've been talking about for the last year and a half or thereabout or other techniques.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","No, it still sounds like that combined with your long laterals you are really seeing some of the best results out there. Thank you.","David Porges","But we'll keep working on, ever working on trying to get better and better.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. A question for you, on your drilling program in the Marcellus obviously the gas price where they are, I guess you made the case that your economics are still good. And so, I guess that implies at this point in time, you are not going to make a change to your overall development program. But can you talk to the extent where you're shifting or you have the capability of shifting activity more to liquids from the drier gas parts of the plane. How much of that is actually going on at this point in time?","David Porges","What we are shifting to the extent that we can obviously we only get the uplift and this is true for everybody goes not just does. We only get the uplift when you're actually able to extract enough of the liquids. We get a certain amount of the uplift just from the so called JT skids for you. But the mainly design just give you a pipeline quality gas of its, I guess the tastes where that can put you over into that making it more economic that I'm more prolific dry gas well. But what we're really focusing on more is the ability to link the development program with the processing capability. So, we're moving in that direction as much as we \u2013 as much as we can, but we are marrying the production activities with the Midstream activities.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Sort of the delay in the MarkWest plant kind of I guess to a certain extent limit your ability to really focus a little bit more efforts in those areas.","David Porges","Not right now because realistically a well that we spend right now, it does affect cash flows in 2012, right I don't want, we mentioned that in the prepared remarks and that's true. But those are on wells that hit over to the spot. For the decisions that we are making now to spot wells, the presumption is that we have a reason to believe those \u2013 that plan will be upon running and preferably some of the increased capacity that we made reference to would be ready as well because there is a lag between the decision to spot now comes online. So, now I wouldn't say that it's \u2013 that client doesn't impact the decisions that we're making on where the drill right now that delay there impacts really third quarter cash flows.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then maybe kind of referring to, may be the early part of the question I had so, if you're looking to the back half of '12 and the early '13, I'm not sure what you are assuming for gas prices. But are you making focused effort with MarkWest expect to be online in 2013 that you are going to drill in the higher liquids areas and can you be pretty fluid with that program if need be?","David Porges","Yeah, but we work with any number of process, we just want to get our \u2013 the liquid extract from the gas and we get the revenue uplift from the propane and butane.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, how much of it?","David Porges","Just one company, I mean, we talked about one company, that's one plant in North and West Virginia, but more broadly yes, we are as we look ahead, we are looking at making sure that we can as we said that we can continue to focus on both the areas that are more liquid rich amongst our acreage as well as the once that are more prolific, which really needs the dry gas so that are \u2013 that have the best economic.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, if memory serves me that plant specifically with MarkWest that we are referring to is a $100 million a day.","David Porges","Our capacity on that would have been is actually is $120 million a day.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Is a $120 million a day? Okay. And then how much of an impact will that shift have or let me ask you the question this way when that plant comes online, how much of an annualized basis improvement would you get in pricing?","David Porges","We have to be able to do the answer for that, probably the best opportunity.","Phil Conti","Part of the Mcf basis, the liquids uplift gives us about $2.50 increase.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","At today's price?","Phil Conti","At today's prices.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, alright. And that's $2.50 per...","Phil Conti","Per Mcf.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Per Mcf \u2013 on an Mcf basis, okay. One last quick question if I could you, Phil, I think you mentioned what your cash balance at the end of the year, I apologize I missed that, could you give us?","Phil Conti","At the end of the first quarter by the way, I'm sorry, $7.45 was at the end of the first quarter.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, okay, $7.45, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anne Cameron of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Hi, good morning. Not to be the dead horse on the West Virginia wet gas issue, but what is your current West Virginia wet gas production from the Marcellus on an Mcfe basis?","Phil Conti","Yeah, we don't provide the breakout on Marcellus by state.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay. So, I guess my \u2013 what I am driving at is when the MarkWest plant does come online is a 100 net enough to handle all of our wet gas production and how much more processing do you need?","David Porges","Well, as we keep growing, we'll need more and more and that's we and we are currently working on and you are well into development what those alternatives are to keep processing more than the 120.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay. And do you have capacity in the second mobile plant?","David Porges","Maybe you talk about it\u2026","Phil Conti","Yeah, I mean, maybe we are \u2013 we have a firm right to a $120 million a day of that plant and MarkWest is putting in a larger plant and we are in discussions with them and others about additional. I would reference on capacity on the plate as well though that as we said before we've been proactive with adding a $100 million a day of capacity. We'll have a total of $100 million out of our Dodgeridge County and at the year end at our other wet area and that's another $100 million a day and with our Sunrise project, we've adequate residue gas to move that gas to market. So, we had been proactive in doing that and when the plant comes on, we're going to be prepared to move the product going forward. So, as they believe we're working toward getting additional processing capacity at this time.","David Porges","We are not concerned about that overtime. The issue is when plants coming, it can move things by a quarter here and there, that's the issue, it's the near-term cash flow forecast, not the longer term strategy that gets impacted.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay, thanks. And that $2.50 uplift, does that correspond to 1.8 gallons per Mcf excluding in the ethane?","Phil Conti","Yes.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Is that about right?","Phil Conti","Yeah.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","And the $2.50 net of processing fees or is it growth of processing fees?","Phil Conti","It was net.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay, got it, thanks. And then in terms of the ethane, can you mix ethane indefinitely from what you can see right now into the gas stream.","Randy Crawford","Well, Anne, this is Randy. From what we can see right now, we have the adequate mix to mixed the dry to meet our pipeline specs and so as we said previously we'll make the decision whether it take the ethane based on economic conditions not on pipeline quality issue.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","What kind of infrastructure would be involved in moving that ethane either to the enterprise line or to the Mariner East project, if you did the side to extract it?","Randy Crawford","Well, our commercial arrangement at MarkWest provides the option that they would extract the ethane and move it.","Randy Crawford","Yeah so really the fact what it means it would take from that plant and would really just I think shift the whole thing up to their one of the fractionation facilities. So really that infrastructure already exists. It just a question on making the determination that it's economical to extract the ethane.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay, got it. And then just a totally separate question, which you may or may not be able to answer given that your docs are still sitting with the SEC. The strategy for the MLP like really is the gain plant to gross third-party volumes with that business or is it really mostly just to process Equity Gas and like how\u2026.","Randy Crawford","What our General Counsel is looking at is shaking our hands.","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Oh, (indiscernible) okay.","Randy Crawford","We don't want to say anything that would make you more likely to buy the unit. So\u2026","Anne Cameron \u2013 BNP Paribas","Okay, okay, I'll backup. Sorry guys. Alright, thank you. That's it from me.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hall of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Most of my questions have been answered. I guess couple of remaining one from me. May I talk about Northeast strategy that changing despite current environment, which make sense. But are there any other tactics that you are kind of reviewing currently that we haven't really talked about outside of just drilling additional liquid rich wells. Any other sorts of cost saving initiatives or things along those lines that are currently under consideration?","David Porges","Yeah. We certainly continue to look at ways to improve cost structure and of course before I alluded to production, but the same thing is to a midstream continuing to improve cost structure. I am not sure I feel comfortable getting into the things that are simply in the development stage because we often look at different alternatives and yet test them out, you see what works and doesn\u2019t.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Got it. And I guess the other one is, have you reviewed or do you continue to review your legacy assets for any sort of Utica exposure I know in the past expense likely to just be in a dry windows. Is there any indication as we can better understand the windows potentially some wet gas and that as well or is there no real change there? Thanks.","David Porges","Not really, I mean maybe there is, but really hadn\u2019t been much change, but we haven't quietly spent too much on focusing on that. The large part of those, which is also deeper in Pennsylvania than it is in Ohio. So, our approach on the Utica is still pretty much what it was for our Pennsylvania acreage, which is \u2013 there is going to come a time where it make sense to drill down basically from the same pads that were using for the Marcellus. Because that will obviously involve an improved cost structure to be able to use all the same pads and well roads and compressor stations, etcetera. So, that will be settled \u2013 when we get to that point time that will show cost structure improvements too.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ray Deacon of Brean Murray. Please go ahead.","David Porges","Ray, you there?","Operator","Mr. Deacon, your line is live. We'll move on to our next question. (Operator Instructions) At the time, we'll take a question from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Hi guys. Couple of follow ups on the frac geometry from Neal's question. First if I remember correctly when you'll first announce that it was said that I might add maybe a million dollar per well and cost, but you are obviously noting that services cost are lower currently so, that's really helping a lot. First part, do you have an updated figure for how much more cost per well to imply the new geometry and to the extent, Dave, we commented some of the new geometry was economic in some cases of less optimal brittleness based entirely on commodity prices. So, when you think about issues of hedging and when you think about commodity prices at their extremes. How does that kind of play into any expansion of this program?","Phil Conti","On the first part, cost for the new frac \u2013 the additional cost per well is about $1.2 million for the 5,300 feet and that's down from $1.4 million previously.","David Porges","On the price side I just generally speaking say that it the areas where it's kind of a gray area whether it makes sense or not. They tend to look better when prices go up. So, yeah, I mean, if you look at this is \u2013 if you want to look at any company as say one thing that would have been if there is a more than you say it's almost if there is the call options embedded price \u2013 long call options on gas price. We cannot to really factor that into much in the hedging because that's, I mean such a long \u2013 there is a longer term play. But you're right it does \u2013 it does suggest if prices are higher that you had more exposure. So, you may that is true, but I don\u2019t know I said we formally corporate that where when we are looking at our hedging strategy. For the most part, the hedging strategy is designed not to pick prices, but to make sure in the cash flow state a reasonable level. So, that we can optimally size our business, right, so, we are at the cash flows don\u2019t get jerked around so much that you're constantly trying to get fewer rigs or more rigs, fewer crews or more crews.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Right. So, cash flow certainty not necessarily rate of return certainty particularly at low gas prices. When you make this decision, are you basing it more on like the current strip of 12 months? Are you basing it on the next 10 years of strips?","David Porges","Well, generally, just ballpark we are typically within more of a five-year strip, but if the price \u2013 I think you'd say in theory and we do try to apply some of this. But you try to hedge not to guess prices, but when certainty about price would alter the behavior or when uncertainty about price would alter the behavior. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that we don\u2019t take returns into our account back. I\u2019d say if there is projects were buy, it\u2019s an attractive investment if prices are at the current level, but prices decline it's not attractive anymore, but that's the time we say yes, best decision is to go ahead and make the investment, but also hedge.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","I got it. Okay, it doesn\u2019t sound simple, but it sounds like you have a lot on your plate to manage the portfolio there.","David Porges","No, but I think a lot of hedging is that, right it's more or like, I guess it's expected utility as suppose to expected value is what we\u2019re looking at. It\u2019s kind of the same as what you\u2019re looking at the life insurance, right? So nobody buys life insurance hoping that it pays off.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Sure.","David Porges","Well, at least start soon.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Well, hopefully, well we get out of this throughout with gas prices and you can enjoy the benefits of the entire portfolio.","David Porges","Yeah again, we do think that we need to be structuring our business and what we pursue is for investment opportunities with a relatively conservative gas price in mind, not to say this one is influenced by the current storage situation. But that \u2013 it\u2019s getting more economical to drill for natural gas at least in our base in the Marcellus, but I guess, we can see the other bases and we need to bear that in mind what we\u2019re forecasting our dividends.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Understood. I appreciate all the color.","David Porges","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","David Porges \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you for everybody for participating and we\u2019ll look forward to doing this again in three months.

Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2013 adjusted earnings of $2.32 per diluted share compared to $1.41 per diluted share in 2012. The high-level story for the year, as well as for the fourth quarter, was very strong volume growth and lower unit of cash costs in both the Production and the Midstream businesses.","Notably, Production volume was 43% higher than last year, natural gas liquids volume was 47% higher, and Midstream gathering volume was up by about 39%. As a result, EQT earnings and EPS for 2013 were both up considerably over 2012 by any measure. Although both years were impacted by some unusual items, that should be considered when interpreting and comparing results year-over-year. I will touch on a couple of these in my comments, and I do refer you to our non-GAAP reconciliations in today's release.","Adjusted operating cash flow of $1.25 billion in 2013 was also up considerably. It was actually 43% higher than last year. And as a reminder, a full year of EQT Midstream Partners, or EQM, results in 2013 and 2 quarters of EQM results in 2012 are consolidated into EQT's results, even though a portion of EQM was owned by the noncontrolling interest during those periods. EQT did receive a total of $33.4 million in distributions from EQM during 2013.","In the fourth quarter, as you know by now, we completed the sale of Equitable Gas and received $740 million in cash plus some Marcellus Midstream assets as consideration. And also, we entered into some commercial arrangements with the purchaser as part of the sale. The sale somewhat complicates the comparison of EPS and cash flow to last year as we estimate that we would have earned about $9 million pretax from that business over the second half of December had we still owned it. This would've increased our EPS and cash flow per share by about $0.04 for the quarter and the year.","As required by GAAP, we carved up the gain on the sale, the transaction costs associated with the sale, and the Distribution business earnings for 2013, and included those items in the discontinued operations line on the income statement. The after-tax gain on the sale totaled $43.8 million and pretax transaction costs were about $8 million for the year and $4.8 million for the fourth quarter.","Also in the fourth quarter, Midstream sold its commercial marketing and trading business for a pretax gain of $19.6 million. This gain is in Midstream's results from continuing operations, but excluded from our adjusted EPS and adjusted cash flow numbers in the table in today's release. Another adjustment that we made to our reported results was the add back of a noncash expense for hedge ineffectiveness totaling $21.3 million for the year and $16.8 million in the fourth quarter. Again, these items are detailed in the release.","Fourth quarter 2013 adjusted earnings were $0.47 per diluted share. That compares to adjusted EPS of $0.43 in the fourth quarter 2012. A significantly higher production in Midstream volumes once again drove the results. Adjusted operating cash flow at EQT was $336 million in the fourth quarter of '13 compared to $299 million for the fourth quarter of '12.","Our operational performance continued to be outstanding in the fourth quarter with 32% higher production volumes than the fourth quarter of 2012 and 6% higher sequentially than the third quarter of 2013. We also realized 24% higher gathering volume than last year and continued low per-unit operating costs.","And finally, the fourth quarter effective tax rate was 48.2%, well above the 33.6% effective tax rate for the entire year. This higher tax rate in the fourth quarter primarily results -- relates to the continued shift in the company's business to states with higher tax rates, most notably, Pennsylvania, and was partially offset by state tax benefits associated with the Distribution business sale transaction. This higher tax rate reduced EPS for the fourth quarter by $0.15 per share versus what we would have reported using the annual rate.","Now moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segment, and I'll limit my discussion to the full year results as the explanation for the full year basically apply to the fourth quarter as well.","So starting with EQT Production, and as has been the case for 4 years now, the big story in '13 at EQT Production was growth in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was 43% for the year, driven by sales from our Marcellus wells, which contributed 73% of the volumes in '13, up from 58% in 2012. The EQT average wellhead sales price was $4.13 per Mcf equivalent in '13, $0.04 lower than last year.","For segment reporting purposes, of that $4.13 per unit of revenue realized by EQT Corporation, $3.08 per Mcfe was allocated to the EQT Production with the remaining $1.05 per Mcf equivalent to EQT Midstream.","The majority of this $1.05 is for gathering, which was -- which averaged $0.82 per Mcf equivalent for the year, down from an average of $1 per Mcf equivalent in 2012. You'll recall the Marcellus gathering rate is significantly lower than the rates in our other plays. So as Marcellus volumes grow, as a percentage of the total, the average gathering rate goes down.","For the full year, total operating expenses at EQT Production were $797 million or 32% higher year-over-year. Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth. DD&A expense represented about $169 million or 88% of that increase, and it's obviously driven by the higher volume.","Absolute LOE, exploration expense and SG&A expense were all a bit higher year-over-year. However, volume increases have been outpacing the general trend of higher absolute expenses. And as you would expect, per-unit expenses were lower again in 2013.","Moving on to the Midstream business. Excluding the gains on the asset sale that I mentioned earlier, operating income here was up 30%, consistent with the 39% growth in gathered volumes. This resulted in a 16% increase in gathering net operating revenues. Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 54% year-over-year as a result of added Equitrans capacity, mainly from that Sunrise Expansion Project, as well as increased throughput.","On the other hand, the line item totaled Storage, Marketing and Other Net Operating Income was down about $9 million for the year. This part of the Midstream business relies on seasonal volatility and spreads in the forward curve and has continued to trend down in 2013.","Net operating expenses at Midstream were about 11% higher year-over-year, consistent with the growth of the Midstream business. Similar to Production, revenues grew at a much faster rate than expenses, resulting in continued reductions in per-unit expenses.","And then finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the year in a great liquidity position with 0 net, short-term debt outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver, and $846 million of cash on the balance sheet. And since year end, EQT received from EQM an additional $110 million in cash for the deferred piece of the Sunrise transaction that was always anticipated, following the sale of Equitable Gas.","Based on current commodity prices and assuming a 2014 average negative basis to NYMEX of $0.37 per Mcf, we continue to forecast approximately $1.6 billion in operating cash flow for 2014. So we expect to fund our $2.4 billion 2014 CapEx forecast with that expected cash flow and current cash on hand.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck to discuss today's reserve release.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Thank you, Phil. This morning, we announced year-end 2013 total proved reserves of 8.3 Tcfe, which is 2.3 Tcfe or 39% higher than the previous year and represents a reserve replacement ratio of 738%. I'll now go into more detail around this reserve increase.","Extensions and discoveries totaled 2.0 Tcfe, which was comprised of 894 Bcfe reclassified to proved from probable and possible; 583 Bcfe from new locations, primarily from closer lateral spacing; and 524 Bcfe from newly economic locations as a result of higher gas pricing, improved type curves and reduced drilling costs.","Drilling capital totaled $1.3 billion, resulting in the drill bit finding cost of $0.62 per Mcfe. Our acquisition of properties from Chesapeake in June 2013 resulted in additions to proved reserves of 473 Bcfe, of which 42 are proved developed and 431 Bcfe are proved undeveloped.","This year, we've begun reporting natural gas liquids as a separate reserve category due to our increasing recovery of NGLs. The inclusion of NGLs added a net 536 Bcfe to our proved reserves, which was comprised of 763 Bcfe of liquids, less 227 Bcfe due to processing shrinkage. NGLs now represent 9% of our proved reserves.","The company's Marcellus proved reserves increased by 1.7 Tcfe or 39%. This increase is driven by improved recovery per well as illustrated by our 17% increase in Mcfe per foot. Additions and extensions related to the 2013 program and the aforementioned Chesapeake acreage acquisition. Offsetting those additions were the removal of 58 Marcellus locations, totaling 368 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves due to changes in our 5-year development plan.","We've also included 215 Bcfe of proved reserves in the Upper Devonian formation, which is comprised of 109 Bcfe of proved developed reserves and 106 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. We added 350 Bcfe of proved reserves in our Huron play, reflecting 1 year of drilling, NGLs and the effective higher gas prices. We have significantly more Huron reserves that meet the standards required to book proved reserves, but they were not booked as a result of not having an established development plan for the Huron beyond 2014.","Our 3P reserves, or the total proved, probable and possible reserves, increased 10.5 Tcfe to 36.4 Tcfe, a 40% increase over the prior year. This increase was comprised of 3.5 Tcfe in the Marcellus, 4.1 Tcfe in the Huron, 2.4 Tcfe in the Upper Devonian, and 0.5 Tcf in other formations.","And finally, we are adjusting our guidance for our DD&A rate for 2014 to reflect the finalized reserve report. We now estimate our per-unit DD&A to be $1.25 per Mcfe or $0.25 lower than 2013. Also, as you will see in our 10-K that we expect to file next week our PV-10 was $3.95 billion, 84% higher than last year, reflecting both the increase in proved reserves and higher commodity prices. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments.","David L. Porges","Thank you, Steve. Given that the results for the fourth quarter have already been covered, I will use my time to walk through our thought process around our 2014 capital expenditure plans.","First, our largest investment is in continued development of our Marcellus acreage. This investment is our highest return opportunity and is driving our growth. We are drilling 90% of our Marcellus for development purposes on multi-well pads, about evenly split between our West Virginia liquids-rich acreage and our Southwestern Pennsylvania acreage. We are drilling 10% of our wells in Central Pennsylvania to delineate this acreage in anticipation of future development. This will assist in determining the most efficient completion techniques, spacing and appropriate sizing for the gathering systems.","We also plan to drill 30 Upper Devonian wells, again, in development mode in our core Marcellus footprint for Upper Devonian as a separate target that is shallower than the Marcellus. These wells are drilled on Marcellus pads using the same rigs and completion equipment that is on-site, thereby increasing the productivity and profitability of our acreage.","We also announced a limited restart of our Huron program. This decision has 2 benefits: first, the economics of the current strip provide an adequate return as we are using existing gathering capacity; and second, by arresting the decline of the Huron volumes, the gathering system becomes a more viable candidate to be dropped into our MLP, EQT Midstream Partners or EQM.","In our Ohio Utica play, we announced a 21 well program for 2014. The intent of this program is to see if we can crack the code in the condensate light oil window. While our first 3 wells were, frankly, mediocre, we are encouraged enough by initial results to try very specific changes to our drilling and completion design intended to improve the economics materially. If we are successful, there is significant acreage available nearby at relatively inexpensive prices largely because of the skepticism about this part of the play.","As you know, we pride ourselves on being innovative, but we need to be confident that successful innovation creates a sufficient reward and the ability to expand our Utica opportunity set economically provides that. By year end, we hope to either demonstrate sufficient improvements in which case it would make sense to add acreage, or conclude that we cannot achieve the needed improvements at this time and discontinue drilling.","On the Midstream side, we are investing $475 million. The largest pieces of this are $345 million in gathering systems to add capacity for EQT drilling in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and $90 million in upgrades to the FERC-regulated transmission line that was acquired as part of the consideration for the Distribution company sale.","EQM is investing another $50 million in organic growth projects. As the cash flow grows at the MLP, it will be able to invest more capital intended to create organic growth.","Another project that our Midstream group is working on is the Ohio Valley Connector. While this project does not impact the 2014 capital budget, we mention it because in January, EQM initiated a FERC open season to assess interest in the project. So you may read about this proposed project in the industry press. This project extends the transmission system from West Virginia to Clarington, Ohio, thereby connecting Equitrans to Texas Eastern and REX.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerated the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Pat Kane.","Patrick John Kane","Thank you, Dave. That concludes the comments portion of the call. Amy, can we please now open the call up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann at SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Steve -- a question for maybe Steve or David. David, you were talking a little bit just there about the Utica. My question is maybe on the Utica. I know some of your peers have mentioned around that Southwestern PA area I know, certainly, where you have some acreage. They've talked about potential Utica potential in that area. Just wondering, your or Steve's thoughts about that and if you would considered testing for any of that at this point?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Neal, this is Steve. We certainly have studied that pretty extensively. And our current view is, we think the dry gas Utica in Southwestern Pennsylvania certainly has potential from a resource perspective. Our studies show that there could be significant amounts of gas in place. Our concerns are that the depth of the formation, therefore, the economics of it, where our existing acreage position is. So that said, I think our view is, it'd be difficult for Utica well under our existing acreage right now to be competitive economically with the Marcellus. Even if it was likely to produce significant amounts of gas, the costs, because of the depths and the higher pressures, the higher pressure frac-ing equipment, everything else involved with operating at those depths and pressures, we're not sure it'd be competitive. That said, I think we would -- we are -- we would think about whether a test, but more of a science test would make sense. And we haven't committed to do that yet or not to do that, but if we think it's warranted and we think we'll learn enough from a test, we might choose to do that.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up, Steve. On -- obviously, the -- amount of Huron that you're getting booked -- I mean, a couple of questions on maybe first -- I'm sorry, skipping around a little bit. First, I think look at the Devonian potential. On those, would you think about sort of drilling in those wells the same way that you've been drilling the Marcellus? Or does it make sense to have maybe a shorter lateral or anything around. I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of type curves between the 2.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I think the drilling and completion techniques, for the most part, we think are similar. Now, we custom-design our frac jobs for really every well based on the geology we're in. So we wouldn't necessarily have an Upper Devonian well frac-ed exactly the same as a Marcellus well below it. But I think in terms of lateral length, our view would be they're almost certainly going to be the same length. And I think our view right now is that we'll likely get the best stimulation of the Upper Devonian by frac-ing it at the same time as the Marcellus or within the same proximity of time, rather than waiting several years, say, down the road. So as we progress with Upper Devonian development, it'll most likely be a combined development program with the Marcellus and Upper Devonian.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the Huron. How much capital or have you said yet, will you commit to that this year or -- and sort of a percentage of total?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Let me grab that number for you.","Patrick John Kane","Neal, this is Pat. We're budgeting $180 million to drill 120 drilling wells in '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker at Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Are there any new Utica wells in Ohio that you could speak about? Any new well results?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","No. We don't have any well results and it'll be likely mid-year before we start getting results from our revised completion program. So midyear at the earliest, I'm not sure we'll be talking about them mid-year. So I don't want to get your expectations up, but it'll be awhile before we even start to get results ourselves.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And how do the lateral lengths compare for your '14 program versus the first 3 you talked about?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","For the Utica?","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. That's right.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","The lateral lengths, I think the average for the next 5 wells is...","Patrick John Kane","6,500 feet is the average that we're projecting for the year.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Pat, what was -- what were the first 3 months?","Patrick John Kane","I don't know exactly. I think it's consistent.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes. They were just north of 6,000.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And so is the thinking of not releasing results that you kind of potentially have better results, and then you can lease up acreage. Is that the thinking?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well, I think, yes, that's a big part of it. And we tend to like to make sure we understand the results before we start talking about them. So sometimes, that takes a little bit of time. So the biggest driver would be, if successful, if we unlock the code in that oily part of the Utica, we want to take advantage of that knowledge before we let everybody else know.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I'm sorry, if I missed this -- you mentioned it before. Do you guys have a plan to test Utica potential in West Virginia? Is there anything on the docket for this year?","David L. Porges","No. Yes, not in the near term. Eventually, what we're probably going to do with the Utica that sits underneath our existing Marcellus is down the road at some point, probably measured in years, we will take advantage of the fact that we already have some infrastructure set up and that will improve the economics. But that doesn't make any sense when we're in the midst of the development of the Marcellus and the Upper Devonian. So no near term plans for development.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Hanold at RBC Capital Market.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Couple of questions just to clarify. So production guidance for 2014, that assumes basically your new 6:1 sort of methodology on ethane, is that correct?","Philip P. Conti","Yes, that's right. That's 6:1 on the liquids.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, okay. And so when we look at where you're kind of coming into -- in the first quarter and where growth could be, it seems like you all are attracting -- it seems like you're attracting well into the high end, if not a little bit higher. Can you just generally talk about just at a high level progression and more so if there are any kind of constraints for us to think about our timing that we need to think about in terms of quarterly progression or production?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","At this point, it's -- of course, there's always -- in a play that's growing this rapidly or an area that's growing this rapidly, there's always going to be midstream constraints. There always have been and there will be until the growth rates at some point wind up slowing down. But that said, what we're really affected by more -- typically, is just the timing of turning in line these big multi-well pads. And at this point, I think, it looks like 2014 is more likely to be a year in which some of that is a bit more back-end loaded than it was, say, in 2013. You may recall that in 2012, it was also kind of back-end loaded. And then in 2013, it was a little bit more front-end loaded just the way the timing happened to work out. In 2014 -- of course there's wells being turned in line essentially every month. But as far as the proportions, it tends to be weighted often more in one direction or another. And I'd say 2014, it would be best for you to assume that it's going to be a bit more in the back end side, which in a sense will set us up well for 2015 also, but that certainly influenced our view for total volumes in 2014.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just looking, obviously, at the numbers, your [indiscernible] in wells not completed, and completed and online. It's obviously at a pretty good peak right now. And obviously, you guys remain pretty active. Is there any midstream projects that are really key for you guys here in the next 12 to 18 months just to kind of reference?","Randall L. Crawford","Well, I mean, I think, as -- Scott, this is Randy. I mean, we're always staying out in front of production and we're pretty confident in our operations and plan. I would say our Sunrise Expansion that we kind of coming on in the third quarter, the compression expansion, which is on track and on time, is a major initiative for us.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Now that's helpful. And on the sales of utility, can you give us what the, I guess, net of any kind of cash tax would have been on that? And what is your cash position right now? Or...","Philip P. Conti","I actually provided the cash position in my comments. We had $846 million on the balance sheet at year end. We did receive another $110 million that was a deferred piece of the Sunrise transaction that we had talked about back in the middle of the year. And in the release this morning, we did show that cash taxes associated with the utility sale of around $68 million, so we received $740 million and paid taxes of about $68 million on that.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right, right. So the $110 million occurred after the year, but...","Philip P. Conti","So it's not in the one $846 million. It would be additive to that. But, of course, we're [indiscernible].","David L. Porges","But if you want to add, you just can't just add the operating cash flow to the $846 million. You have to add in that $110 million that we received actually from EQM as part of that, I guess, you'd call it like a mini drop.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Understood, understood. And one last question here. The general partner, obviously, you guys are stepping back and kind of evaluating value within EQT overall. And can you give us your current thoughts on the general partner and kind of different directions that could go?","Philip P. Conti","Sure. Let me take a shot at that. I think, hopefully, it's obvious we've been pretty focused on realizing the full value of the EQT Midstream interest that EQT owns in the EQT stock price. We've really been doing that, I think, for the last several years. It started with our decision a few years ago to sell some noncore midstream assets to folks who valued them, frankly, more highly than we did. Those kind of -- those were actually buyers -- those buyers were MLPs and we noted that. We continued reforming our own MLP. And so we did that 1.5 years ago to the big drop earlier this year. We're still in the early stages of those drop downs, which we believe allow EQT to achieve a premium valuation for our midstream assets, but at the same time, maintaining control and benefiting from the accretion and value to the EQM LP units and GP interests that EQT can continues to own. Now the GP interest is probably the least visible and most often overlooked midstream interest owned by the company. But it, too, as you know, is extremely valuable. The GP cash flows to EQT are pretty small currently. They were about $2 million of GP distributions in 2013, but we expect that to grow rapidly and reach $40 million or more by 2015 and over $70 million in 2016. So while some of the parts analysis can be tricky, one can certainly make the argument and some of you on the call already have made it that the full value of EQT Midstream interest, including the LP and GP interest, is not transparent in the current EQT stock price. And frankly, we tend to agree at this point. So -- and if we do conclude that a clear value disconnect exists, there are a variety of alternatives available to us to address that. You know what they are. Some of our energy industry peers have already taken similar steps. So, Scott, I'm not going to address and\/or list them today. I think it's a little premature to discuss what they are. There are a variety of factors that could cause us to go down one path versus another. So, I guess, to summarize, I would say, at this point, we expect to have a pretty good idea of what we want to do, if anything, by the end of this year. And frankly, it's not clear that it would be wise to take any significant action before then anyway. Said differently, just as we want to make sure that EQT shareholders benefit from transparency and the valuation of our midstream interest, we don't want to deprive them of that value by transferring a significant portion of it to another party by acting too soon. So I hope that helps for now. That's really about as much as we want to say about that right now. Suffice it to say that it's an issue that we're studying closely.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. So it sounds like we'll hear more about that towards at the end of the year. Okay, fair enough.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","The -- let's see. I've got plenty to ask about. I guess, while we're on the topic of the value -- transparency of the value of the portfolio. What's the kind of latest thinking on drop downs this year? I know you're a little hesitant to talk about timing of it, but I'm just curious, like, is it one large drop down, multiple drop downs? How big of a roll moving or escalating -- potential escalation of interest rates play into that thinking? Just any update around that plan that you'd be willing to share.","David L. Porges","I don't know if we want to talk about 1 versus 2 for particular assets. But I will maybe reiterate that we are still thinking, unlike we were talking about at the time of the IPO, but this thinking has evolved to the point where we're still thinking that the right answer is to have a more accelerated, rather than a less accelerated drop schedule. And I agree with the premise of your question that the prospect of higher interest rates was one of the reasons for doing that. But from my perspective at least, a more fundamental reason for it is that is a lower cost of capital vehicle than the corporation. And I think a lot of that is because of the transparency issue. The folks who invest in that vehicle, which is to, say, EQM, are looking for exactly that type of asset. And since it's their pistol, so to speak, they are willing to offer more favorable valuations in the marketplace for that. And therefore, that's the best home of -- for those assets. So that is the mindset that we've got as we look at drops as opposed to, if you will, what we talked about at the time of the EQM IPO, which was sizing it to EQT's midstream capital requirements. Now what's the rate at which EQM can digest these is really more the issue.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. And what would be the constraints around the rate at which EQM could digest them?","David L. Porges","Well, part of it, of course, so they're going to fund -- there's the combination of equity and debt so the capital markets availability is one of the issues for them. Another one is that they are best off with projects typically, where every -- most of their projects be projects whereby they're already generating cash flow. So the projects where there's still a lot of construction going on tend not to be as good a fit for an entity that is paying out the vast majority of its cash flow in the form of distributions. And it's hard to keep up growth if you do that and, of course, we are focused on continuing to grow that distribution. So typically, they want to have these projects to be ones that have already been fully contracted and turned in line, et cetera. That said, as EQM grows, it is able to wear, if you will, a higher dollar amount in projects that are under construction. And we do think you should expect to see that as we go forward. But, of course, accelerating drops means that we more quickly get to the point where EQM can absorb bigger and bigger projects on its own and quite possibly have some of these projects especially ones that are designed to support other producers, occur at the EQM level and never having going through EQT. Does that help?","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Yes, it does. I guess, last on that, and I'll -- just it would be curious. In the outline, you've got quite a cash position already. Clearly, some outspend in the '14 budget that, that would, I guess, fund. But then you got likely some drops come in this year as well. Is that capital -- I mean, are there future capital allocations, I guess, that could come throughout the rest of the year regarding the 2014 upstream program? Or are we pretty well set and whatever capital comes in this year really just funds 2015? Just trying to think that through.","David L. Porges","We're not setting capital programs based on cash availability. That's not up something we want to get into. I mean, obviously, we look at investment opportunities, but frankly, with this kind of cash position, you look at stock repurchases also.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. And so, yes, that was kind of a follow-on. I mean, is that something that is higher up on the list than it has been, let's say, in the last 6 months?","David L. Porges","Well just because we don't -- we certainly would not consider ourselves to be capital constrained right now. I mean, that would not be a good mindset for us to have. We could fund the attractive projects. So from that -- and probably, I don't know, before -- certainly before EQM was formed, we probably would have viewed ourselves as capital constrained from the perspective of cash availability compared to the volume, the dollar volume of attractive investment opportunities. So that has changed over the course of the last 1.5 years or so. And obviously, the sale of the Distribution company furthers that. So yes, from that perspective, it is higher up. If you're referring to how attractive share repurchases would look. Yes, that is higher up than it would have been.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Yes, that's helpful. Okay. And then, I guess, the last one on my end would just be any updates or just maybe remind me on your marketing arrangements that protect around basis risk as we head into the summer? Any steps that are being taken to further protect around those risks on a go-forward basis?","Philip P. Conti","Well, Michael, in terms of our capacity portfolio and really, I guess, I would comment the colder-than-normal winter has certainly been helpful in terms of increased demand and record storage withdrawals. And over this period of time, we've seen better realized pricing in the Appalachian basin. So we're more optimistic than we maybe when heading into the winter season and we have seen some support in the summer basis as the market looks to balance for power generation, as well as refill the storage. So -- but in terms of capacity, we have stressed in the past, we continue to look at and make commitments on long-haul pipelines to get gas to a variety of markets. Our goal is always to stay ahead of our production growth and not relying on just one spot market. We've recently entered into several agreements that have added to that portfolio, and I'll go and give you few of those. Our most significant addition became effective on February of this year, February 1. That's when we added 245,000 dekatherms a day of capacity for approximately 7 years on Texas Eastern system to the M3 market and the Transco Zone 5 markets. And both of these appear stronger relative to other basins. So in total, we currently have almost 950,000 dekatherms a day of firm pipeline capacity out of the basin plus we have approximately 350,000 dekatherms per day of firm sales for a total of 1.3 million deks per day. And again, in addition to that, by the end of 2014, based on existing commitments, we'll have about 1.6 million dekatherms per day between firm pipeline capacity and firm sales. So with that, we always feel comfortable with our position in 2014 and heading into '15. And again, moving forward, we'll continue to add our firm capacity portfolio and add to the diversity of our markets, including the Midwest and the Southeast market.","David L. Porges","And we remain incidentally, very happy to utilize the expertise and the assets we have in the midstream area to redirect gas flows as appropriate to meet market needs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth at BMO.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of quick questions on the reserve report. That the 7.2 Bs or 1.7 per thousand lateral split, the EURs for the Marcellus. Does that include -- is that only PUDs or does that also include the PDPs? And then what would be the difference to the 2 Bs per thousand foot of your type curve in Southwest PA and Northwest Virginia?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","So could you repeat that? I couldn't hear the first part of your question.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was just asking if the proved reserves EUR booking that you had highlighted in the press release includes the older PDPs or is that just PUDs.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","That's all proved reserves, so including PDPs.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Do you know what the PUDs were booked at? And then also the future development costs assumed in the PV-10 calculation?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I don't think we have that handy.","Patrick John Kane","Maybe I could follow-up with you after the call. We don't have that data in front of us.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then in the Huron, can you talk about your expectations for 2014 volumes given the renewed activity there? And then under that scenario, what would be the gathering EBITDA for that asset?","Philip P. Conti","The gathering EBITDA, I think, is in $50 million to $75 million range. It will depend on commercial contracts and things like that. But that's sort of a range that we're using right now.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","And from a volume perspective, the program was designed to flatten the decline or to, basically, keep throughput flat with maybe a couple single-digit percent increase in throughput. But that's how the level of drilling was determined.","David L. Porges","But one of the things we have to go through as we look at a drop, just so you know, is pretty much decide what we think the right rates are because right now, probably 99% of the volumes that are flowing through those systems are EQT volumes. So there's really not an issue of having to have arm's length agreements. But obviously, ahead of the drop, we're going to need to relook at those tariffs to relook at the other contractual terms as well. And that is something actually that we are working through to make sure that what we come up with, we think is in the best interest of EQT as a whole. And the numbers Phil gave you gives you a pretty good, decent snapshot of where we are now, but we're relooking at that in the context of the -- of prospective future drop.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That makes sense. And then is it too early to talk about the total expansion opportunity for the Ohio Valley Connector just in terms of increased capacity, capital spending? I think if I think back to Equitrans or Sunrise Expansion, you'd added about 1 Bcf a day for 300 million. How does that compare to what your expectations are for the Ohio Valley Connector?","David L. Porges","Well, I'd say right now, I mean, it's a bit early because we're in the process of the open season. And so we're scoping that out, but I think as you think about that project and the market demand for that, we would kind of view that as similar to what we were working on to a Sunrise-type project. But it is early and we're scoping out the demand right now in terms of the size and the capital that will be spent.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then last, just 2 quick modeling questions. On the lower DD&A, is that going to trend lower throughout the year? Or would that be the run rate beginning in the first quarter? And then also, expectations for tax rate for the year, given the minority interest from the MLP increasing?","Philip P. Conti","So the DD&A rate is a flat rate for the -- that'd be a good rate for you -- use for your modeling for the full year. I don't know that we've said anything about the tax rate right now. Obviously, you're right. It trends down because of the issue that you mentioned. I would say use a similar rate as this year for now without knowing anymore. It's going to obviously vary depending on a lot of factors.","Operator","The next question comes from Cameron Horwitz at U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Dave, I was hoping can you just maybe give us a little color on the M&A landscape and kind of the deal for opportunity that you're seeing in the Marcellus, opportunities that acred similar to what you did last year?","David L. Porges","Yes. I don't know if I -- I still have a view that we're going to see a lot more acreage of the sort -- that sort of transaction come up over the course of time. But I don't know that I have anything specific to offer around what the landscape looks like right now. Steve, do you have anything specific that you want to...","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","No. Just as he said, it's typical. It ebbs and flows, and I think we're seeing more, smaller, little deals right now. But I would expect that, that'll -- deals come and go in this business. So we're not really seeing anything of note, positive or negative, in terms of a change. So I think there's still opportunities out there and we're pursuing them.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And then just lastly for me. On the -- and forgive me if you said it, but the 368 that came off the books in the Marcellus, you talked about the changes in the development plan. Was it -- is there anymore color you can provide just where that was?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","They were spread out a little bit. But they were more in second-tier areas where, as we've defined and focused our drilling, our plans have been more concentrated in certain areas than we were anticipating a few years ago when we originally booked those PUDs. And per the SEC guidelines, once we -- once we have a development plan that doesn't include those, we thought it was appropriate to remove them. But they're -- from a technical standpoint, they would still qualify as PUDs. They were only removed because when we're looking at where we're going to drill based on results, but also based on available capacity and all those factors, they just didn't fit anymore. So really not much more to it than that.","David L. Porges","And you're going to see that, I think, over the course of time. Over the last couple of years or maybe little bit more than that, the SEC has gotten a pretty strict about that, so we take that very seriously. And we'll check that with our 5-year development plan. And if something isn't in it, we'll just remove it. It doesn't mean that we think any lesser of those reserves and they presumably will show back up as proved reserves at some point in the future. But for now, all we have is the 5-year plan that we've gotten blessed by the board at this moment, and then we'll go from there.","Operator","At this time, we show no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Kane for any closing remarks.","Patrick John Kane","Thanks -- thank you, everybody, for participating.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Patrick Kane. Thank you. You may begin.","Patrick Kane","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT's conference call. With me today are Steve Schlotterbeck, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob McNally, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer; David Schlosser, Senior VP and President of Exploration and Production; and Jerry Ashcroft, Senior Vice President and President of Midstream.","The replay for this call will be available starting this evening for a seven-day period. The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415 with a confirmation code of 13650784. The call will also be replayed for seven days on our website.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, which can be accessed on our \u2013 the Investor portion of our website, www.eqt.com. Included in the release are comments regarding EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval.","In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement, prospectus regarding the proposed transaction [Audio Dip] which registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC. The joint proxy statement, prospectus and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com; or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable; or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov.","You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction, including information about EQT and Rice and their respective directors, executive officers and employees who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect to the proposed transaction and a description of their direct and indirect interest by security holdings or otherwise.","The special meeting of EQT shareholders is scheduled to be held on November 9. Given investor focus on the transaction, we will keep our prepared remarks brief today in order to facilitate your questions. To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP; are consolidated in EQT results.","Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial number for that call is 201-689-7817. In a moment, Rob will summarize the third quarter results and Steve will give a brief update. Following their prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Jerry will be available to answer your questions.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the SEC and available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob McNally.","Rob McNally","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I will keep my comments on the quarter brief as it was a relatively clean and straightforward quarter and we expect there's more interest in some of the non-operational topics. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 compared to a $0.28 loss per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016.","Net income and adjusted net income and EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2017, were favorably impacted by a decrease in the estimated effective annual income tax rate and discrete items totaling $29.7 million that resulted in an income tax benefit that added $0.17 to adjusted EPS this quarter.","Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $205.9 million as compared to $166.5 million for the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $82.1 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interest in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to $78.1 million in the third quarter of 2016.","So moving to production. Sales volumes were 205.1 Bcfe for the third quarter, representing a 5% increase over the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we experienced approximately 3.5 Bcfe of curtailments which were not expected. The curtailments resulted from outages on third-party systems. Despite this impact, third quarter production fell within the stated guidance range for the quarter.","Additionally, given how close we are in timing to the Rice vote, we will not provide guidance for the fourth quarter, but we'll tell you that our full year 2017 volumes are on track with previously stated guidance. And we expect the EQT-only exit rate to be approximately 2.7 Bcfe per day. The third quarter 2017 realized price, including cash-settled derivatives, was $2.76 per Mcfe, a 26% increase compared to the third quarter of last year.","Operating revenue for the production company totaled $597.7 million, which was $89.6 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. Total production operating expenses were $585.6 million for the quarter, which is 1% higher than the second quarter of 2017, which is consistent with the volume growth that we experienced.","Moving on to pricing. Local basis was a bit weaker than we expected. However, a majority of our 2017 local basis exposure is locked in, resulting in a third quarter differential of negative $0.85 per Mcf, which was within our guidance range for the quarter. This differential represents a $0.21 decline over the second quarter of 2017 but is a $0.36 improvement over the third quarter of 2016.","Now moving on to midstream results. EQT gathering operating income was $85.8 million, $13.3 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $116.5 million, a $17.4 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses for the quarter were $30.7 million, a $4.1 million increase over the same period last year.","EQT transmission operating income was $59.7 million, $6 million higher than the third quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $90.7 million, a $13.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses were $31 million for the quarter, which a $7.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2016.","I will close out my remarks by providing you with a brief liquidity update. As you may have seen, we successfully completed a bond offering at a blended coupon rate of 3.14%. This offering brought in $3 billion of proceeds that will be used together with previous cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the cash portion of the acquisition, repay existing Rice indebtedness and redeem EQT bonds that are due in early 2018.","With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Schlotterbeck","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everybody. Since announcing the Rice acquisition in June, we've had hundreds of conversations with our shareholders. Through this dialogue, we've listened to many opinions and heard many suggestions. Consistent with what we've always done, we take action when we feel it's in our shareholders' best interest. To that point, over the last few months, we've taken the following steps, all of which were driven by doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders.","We committed to establishing a board committee to evaluate options for addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount. We committed to announcing the decision of that review by the end of the first quarter 2018. We committed to adding two new independent directors to the board with a focus on midstream experience. We committed to include these new directors on the committee tasked with the sum-of-the-parts review.","We committed to moving the director nomination deadline to be after the sum-of-the-parts decision announcement. And lastly, we removed volume growth as a metric from future compensation plans and will replace it with return on capital and operating and development cost metrics. In short, we've listened to our shareholders and we've acted.","Before opening the call to your questions, and since we are now two weeks away from the vote deadline, I do want to emphasize once again the merits of the Rice transaction. The primary driver of success in our industry is being the low-cost producer, and the most impactful way to drive per unit costs lower is through longer laterals. Establishing a dominant footprint of highly contiguous acreage that allows for sustained long lateral development is a real competitive advantage. This is what the Rice transaction creates for us.","Our competitors may be able to replicate things like new drilling technology or new drilling techniques, but they can't replicate an acreage position that supports 12,000-foot laterals in the core of the Marcellus. While this is the main attribute of the transaction, there are many benefits of the transaction that create real value for our shareholders.","The deal is 20% cash flow accretive in 2018 and 30% in 2019. It is accretive to NAV per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver the $2.5 billion of base synergy value and also deliver significant value from upside synergies. There are substantial midstream synergies to be realized. And lastly, our ability to address the sum of the parts in the most shareholder value-accretive way is enhanced by creating a more robust upstream and midstream business.","In conclusion, we appreciate the dialogue that we've had with our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support, and we urge you to please vote for the Rice transaction on the white proxy card. With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A.","Patrick Kane","Thanks, Steve. Rob, can we open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Singer","There's much discussion about the ongoing capital needed to fill in holes to make acreage truly contiguous in Appalachia. Can you talk to your efforts on this in the third quarter and the risks that you see of increasing \u2013 to increasing lateral length, whether or not the Rice acquisition is successful?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Sure, and thanks for the question, Brian. So yes, we have disclosed that we expect between $100 million and $200 million per year for additional fill-in acreage to put these laterals together. That's actually consistent with what it already takes for us to achieve our roughly 8,000-foot lateral average today. So without Rice, we spend \u2013 I think we spend about $140 million per year getting to 8,000 feet. We expect to continue to spend roughly that much to put together the 12,000-foot laterals with Rice.","So that's just part of what we do, and we do it every day. We've got a large land department. It's the second-biggest department in the upstream company, second only to the field personnel, the operators. And they work every day putting the jigsaw puzzle together. That's what they do. So this is part and parcel of what we do every day, and that won't change with Rice. In fact, in a lot of ways, it will facilitate that work because it will be \u2013 since we're \u2013 the overlay with Rice is \u2013 there's such a good overlay that we're frequently running into Rice when we're trying to fill in those holes. And if we have Rice consolidated with us, then picking up those missing pieces will likely be easier and perhaps even cheaper.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you. And then as the board considers ways of unlocking sum of the parts value, can you just talk more specifically about, a, what's been considered in the past? And then as the board and you embark in this endeavor, whether the null option of the as-is scenario would be considered?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Brian, I don't want to speak about what's been done in the past because I think all that matters is what the special committee is going to do going forward. But I would say, given the null hypothesis, I can't presuppose what the committee will determine. But the fact that we are talking about a sum of the parts discount and taking the actions that we've described to address it should be a clear indication that our expectation is that the status quo is highly unlikely to be the best answer for addressing the sum of the parts. So \u2013 well again, the committee got to do its work and make its conclusions. We wouldn't be talking about a sum of the parts discount the way we are if we thought that doing nothing was going to be the result.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Steve Schlotterbeck","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Hanold","A big part of the focus of the combination of Rice is also managing go-forward growth a little bit more to returning maybe some cash to shareholders. Can you give us a broad brush kind of color right on how you think that's going to look? And what point, assuming that the shareholders vote for the deal on November 9, how quickly do you expect to kind of get into that mode?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Yes. I think, Scott, we anticipate being roughly cash flow neutral in 2019 and living below our cash flow in 2020. So that's roughly the time line that we've laid out. And part of that is, 2018, we won't quite be there yet because we have the \u2013 our big capacity position on MVP coming online. And we want to fill the bulk of that capacity that makes the most economic sense. So otherwise, we'd be doing it a little quicker.","Scott Hanold","Okay, okay. So specific to NBP in the short term. And you sort of led me to my second question. Can you \u2013 there's been some updates on, I guess, for certificates here recently. What's the update on timing on that one? Do you all expect to get a big go-forward on that? And could you remind us how that timing \u2013 the various timing impacts getting this project done on time?","Jerry Ashcroft","Hi. This is Jerry Ashcroft speaking. Yes, we were really pleased to get the FERC certificate recently. We're still looking for a notice to proceed in 2017. That's gone \u2013 we've got 80% of the pipe already here. We'll have 100% and be ready to have a shovel-ready project at the beginning of 2018, which still puts us in line for service at the end of 2018. So we don't see any major obstacles. Obviously, we have some state and federal permits that we have to get through, but really, the FERC certificate was the kickoff for us.","Scott Hanold","Okay. So you indicated that you need the notice to proceed. So as to remind us, what's the key group that needs to kind of give you that okay? And what needs to be done to get that?","Jerry Ashcroft","Yes, we still have to finish some things up with the State of West Virginia and Virginia, which we will be doing in November and December. We're in constant conversations with them. Once that's done, we'll \u2013 and then we feel as though the FERC will give us the notice to proceed. So that's the timing for 2017.","Scott Hanold","Got it. Understand, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Good morning. I guess I want to follow up a little on the first question with regards to leasing. Can you just discuss what sort of leasehold maintenance requirements you have with the existing leasehold between EQT and Rice? And any sort of leasehold exploration that we ought to keep in mind over the coming, call it, 12 to 24 months.","Steve Schlotterbeck","Yes, Mike. I don't have the specific numbers, but I would remind you that the bulk of EQT's acreage is HBP, so there are no ongoing maintenance or renewal costs. There is some related to the Rice acreage, but I don't think it's material. We could get back to you with a more specific number. I don't have that handy.","Michael Hall","Okay. But suffice to say, while you are pursuing the ongoing leasing, to the extent any of that is hung up, that there isn't a large or a material amount of leasehold that could expire in the interim. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Steve Schlotterbeck","No, no. They had minimal near-term expirations, and they have some several years down the road, most of which we would expect to hold by drilling before they expire. But there will likely be some that we decide that they may have options to extend, that we would exercise those options if they didn't fit in our drilling program before expiration. So there will be a little bit, but it won't be material.","Michael Hall","Understood and helpful. And then second, on the transportation and gathering expense side of things, just trying to think through how should all \u2013 any of the terms that you have within EQM, within EQT come up for renewal following this transaction, if that sets of any renegotiations. And what sort of opportunities there might be to blend and extend any of those agreements with EQM?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Yes, Mike. We don't have any near-term agreements expiring. So those are all \u2013 quite a few \u2013 you hit 2024 to 2026 before they start to expire. I think we will likely explore whether there are win-win renegotiations for blend and extend or \u2013 I think it's way too early to tell and we're going to have to really run the analysis to see what the trade-offs are. But I can say for certainty, the only way any contracts get renegotiated is if both parties come out with a win. It has to be a win- no transfer in value between the two companies.","Michael Hall","Okay. Helpful. I appreciate it. And then I guess last on my \u2013 and just maybe, could you talk about the market dynamics as you see them in the Southeast markets as you bring on MVP? And how you think maybe pricing in that region will play out relative to Henry Hub as a new line of supply comes on?","Jerry Ashcroft","Yes. This is Jerry Ashcroft again. We're really excited about where MVP is going in at Station 165. It really gives us the opportunity to move both into the Southeast and to go into the Gulf Coast. As you know, the pet chem facilities in Louisiana and Texas are really expanding. We see that as an opportunity, and we also see just the population growth in the Southeast being a big pull, so that the Appalachian supply hub can feed both.","Michael Hall","Okay. And you think that, that market is sufficient to, I guess, proceed with the volumes without any material impact to price?","Jerry Ashcroft","Yes, we do. I mean, we're in conversations with power plants and utilities down there and \u2013 so that we have a good feel that, that market that can sustain it.","Michael Hall","Okay, great. That\u2019s it for me for now. Thanks for the time guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Holly Stewart with Scotia. Please proceed with your question.","Holly Stewart","Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe just a couple of quick housekeeping-type items. Steve, maybe first, best guess on the timing for these two advisory firms to come out and provide a recommendation?","Steve Schlotterbeck","I think we expect \u2013 we think Friday is likely. Don't know for sure, but I think Friday is our best estimate for when we'll get the Glass Lewis and ISS recommendation.","Holly Stewart","Okay. And then also \u2013 I mean, historically, you've done your kind of forward-looking guidance in December. Is that still potentially the case here with the close of Rice imminent?","Rob McNally","Yes. That's right, Holly.","Holly Stewart","Okay. And then maybe, Rob, since chimed in, one for you. Remind me, have the ratings agencies come out and given their opinion on the deal?","Rob McNally","They have, and they've affirmed our ratings. So they \u2013 we went through the RAS\/RES process with them earlier this summer. They were \u2013 kept them up to date when we did the bond offering, and so we expect our ratings to hold.","Holly Stewart","Investment-grade. Okay. Great. And just one final one for me, if I could. Steve, maybe any update on the asset sales process, Barnett and Permian, that I know you guys have talked about?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Well, not Barnett for us. Permian\u2026","Holly Stewart","Actually, Permian.","Steve Schlotterbeck","There's actually no update. We've been a little distracted on other things, so those have been put in the back burner for now. But once we get back to more business as usual, I think we'll bring those to the forefront again.","Holly Stewart","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning, guys. Steve, what \u2013 you just mentioned that \u2013 on the prepared remarks about the outages from the third party. Could you expand on that little bit? And do you perceive that reoccurring at all through the rest of this year?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Well, I mean, with third-party outages, you never know. The specific outages that we had, I certainly do not expect to see again. So the biggest one was related to a liquids line at one of the processing plants. After a major thunderstorm, they had a slip, and the line was taken out for several days. And so the plant couldn't operate. So they repaired that. It's back, operational. Shouldn't happen again. So these were kind of onetime occurrences. But you can never rule out that something completely different would happen at some point in the future, but these should not be recurring incidents.","Neal Dingmann","Okay. Good details. And then you had a fair amount \u2013 I think it was over 32 turning line upward \u2013 or I'm sorry, 16 Upper Devonian wells. The plan, at least for the rest of this year, will you continue to be just as active? I know \u2013 think what you described those once as sort of use it or lose it on those. Could you just maybe give details of those? I guess a lot of that's going to depend on the deal consummating, but at least for now, what's your thoughts on Upper Devonian plan?","David Schlosser","This is David. I apologize, I have a cold, so my voice is a little rough. But about the same through the last quarter of the year. I think we're estimating 16 Upper Devonians next quarter.","Steve Schlotterbeck","And Neal, I would say post Rice, we would expect to do less Upper Devonian as a percentage of our program. And the only ones that we would be doing at that point are the ones that are exceptionally long. So roughly, I think, maybe 15,000, 16,000-footers, where the economics of that is competitive with a 12,000-foot Marcellus. So post Rice, you'll see shift to only extremely long Upper Devonians.","Neal Dingmann","Okay. And then just lastly, just a bit of a hypothetical on this Rice deal closing. You've had that slide out that shows, really, the amount of how this acquisition triples this capacity to the Gulf. So I'm just wondering, once that does close, will you immediately start reallocating some? And will your marketing team sort of step in and start doing some of that reallocation towards some of those markets?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Well, definitely. I mean, we'll assess where the \u2013 where we'll get the best netbacks for the capacity we have available. And our commercial team monitors that stuff daily. So it will provide more optionality, which will create opportunities to capture better prices. As the differentials between demand basins moves around, we'll be able to stay in sync with it.","Neal Dingmann","Perfect. Thanks, Steve and Dave. Good luck on the deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikram Bagri with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Vikram Bagri","Good morning. I understand I'm jumping the gun here a bit, but following up on an earlier question, it is a disparity between gathering and compression rates at both the midstream entities you'll have after the transaction. How should we think about these rates longer term? Would you look to address to ease the rates after the deal? Or would it be after 2025, 2026 time frame that you just mentioned? How would you look to address that disparity in gathering rates?","Rob McNally","Yes, I think \u2013 this is Rob. And I think that the rates that exist will remain in place, something \u2013 unless there is some sort of blend-and-extend negotiation that makes sense for both businesses. And then going forward, I would expect the rates would be at kind of market rates. I think they would be right down the middle of the fairway. And so I think what you'll see is that the rates to the production company will be blended lower with a combination of the Rice's lower rates, and then market rates for future projects.","Vikram Bagri","Great. That\u2019s all I have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Venker","Good morning, everyone. I just want to clarify those comments you made on the free cash flow profile in 2019 and 2020, just to clarify whether that would be still the case for the E&P stand-alone business fully separated from EQGP and EQM. Or if it remains consolidated, if you'll be free cash flow positive in 2019, if that's the\u2026","Steve Schlotterbeck","Well, that \u2013 it assumes the Rice transaction moves forward, but it does not assume the cash flow from the GP. So yes, that does apply to the E&P business stand-alone.","Rob McNally","Just to add to that. It applies both ways, stand-alone or separated. But obviously, there is a significant a lot of cash flow coming from the GP that then wouldn't be there if there was some sort of separation transaction.","Drew Venker","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then on the drilling activity for next year. Can you just talk about how much of your program you expect to be tying into sales in Pennsylvania in 2018 versus West Virginia, comparing 2018 versus 2017?","Steve Schlotterbeck","We're still working on our 2018 plan, so I can't give you that kind of detail. The one data point I can share at this point is \u2013 and it's a bit preliminary, but I think this is probably the minimum. In the acquisition area, where we said we're going to average 12,000-foot laterals, we expect to be able to come right out of the gate in 2018 and average at least 12,700 feet in that area. So in terms of delivering on the synergies, we're going to be able to start demonstrating that from day one. So we're pretty excited that the more we work the maps and get the data incorporated as we plan for the integration, our ability to deliver on that, our confidence in that, keeps going up. So we're going to come out of the gate at 12,700 at least and probably go up from there.","Drew Venker","And Steve, that would be \u2013 once you'd spud right after the transaction closes. And so turning in line is about 12 months from then, does that sound right?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Yes. 9 to 12 would be the average. Yes.","Andrew Venker","Okay. And if I could, just one follow-up on the free cash profiles. Does it still make sense in your mind to plan to return cash to shareholders if the E&P ends up being a stand-alone business? Steven","Steven Schlotterbeck","I think \u2013 the answer is yes in terms of a strategy. And I think that's just sound business for the industry we're in. I will say, with Rice, it's much more achievable than without Rice. Without Rice and without the improved cost structure, the ability to do that, it's still there, but the growth rates will be less attractive because we'll have to spend more money to get the same growth rate than we would with the Rice transaction because of all of the benefits we talked about. So I think conceptually, it is the right direction for EQT, and frankly, the entire industry. I hope others go that direction as well. And that seems to be gaining traction, so I think others are talking about that and contemplating it. But again, it's much more doable and it will be much more attractive with Rice than without Rice.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, Steve, I wanted to see if you could dig down a little bit. Obviously, a lot of focus recently on kind of acreage maps and interpretations of how many long-lateral locations you long-lateral locations you have on a pro forma basis. I just wondering if you could, again, just maybe go through your confidence around the 1,200 number on a pro forma basis.","Steven Schlotterbeck","Well, extremely confident. I just gave you one stat that supports that confidence, where we're going to come out of the gate above the average. And that's \u2013 I think that's pretty remarkable, given that we have to re-permit all this. We have to get started from scratch. So high, high confidence. And I'll give you a couple other stats that maybe will relay some confidence, especially in contrast to some of the noise that's been out there. In Greene County, which is where the bulk of this acreage is \u2013 there's lot in Washington, too, but if you just focus on Greene County for a second.","Greene County has a total acreage of 370,000 acres. To date, over the last 11 years, 75,000 of those acres have been developed. So the gas is being drained from 75,000 acres. At least 295,000 acres in Greene County alone that un-yet \u2013 are, as of now, undrilled and undeveloped and undrained. That's about 80% of the acreage in Greene County still is available to produce gas. And one other stat for us and for Greene County, again, there's 370,000 acres. After the Rice transaction, EQT will control 212,000 of those acres. So 57% of the county will be under the control of EQT, where 80 % of that is remaining to be drilled. So there's lots of remaining inventory acreage. Tremendous amount of resource in place. So very, very confident in our ability to deliver on that synergy.","Arun Jayaram","That\u2019s very helpful. And I was just wondering, Steve, if you could also talk about, from a technical team standpoint, other factors that you think would support kind of the industrial logic of the transaction.","Steven Schlotterbeck","Well I think, in our presentation, you see that list of upside synergies, so ones that are not included in the economics of the deal. But I think you can look at most of those, and it's not hard to wrap your head around. There will be value created there. So obviously, purchasing power. we know when we contract for drilling and fracking services, the more work we offer, the better rates we get. With Rice, we'll be able to offer more work.","So we'll get better prices. Both \u2013 I mean \u2013 EQT and Rice have been amongst the leaders in Appalachia in terms of developing the new techniques and technologies to improve recoveries. And the way that works is a lot of that is testing various ideas that the technical folks have. EQT engineers have certain ideas that we've tested. And the testing involves drilling a well, modifying a technique, getting the well in line, gathering production data over many months or a year to determine whether that new technique was effective or not. So you can only test a certain number of ideas.","So EQT's tested ideas we've had, Rice has tested ideas they've had, they're not necessarily the same ideas. So when we can get the databases and the technical teams together to review all of that data as one, there certainly will be best practices from both sides that can be combined to improve recoveries and lower costs. So it's hard to predict exactly what those techniques are at this point. We have to do the work and get the technical teams working on it. But not hard to imagine that there is going to be incremental value there. And it could be significant because it doesn't take much improvement in recovery to drive a significant amount of shareholder value. And then there's a list of seven upside synergies you can see in our presentation. So I think there's plenty of upside. But the deal makes a ton of sense even if we don't get any of that, which won't happen.","Arun Jayaram","Got you. And my final question. It looks like you raised your year-end exit rate guide, at least on a stand-alone basis, to 2.7 to 2.6 \u2013 from 2.6 to 2.7. Wanted to ask a little bit about on the tied-in line, you did 49 versus the guided 55. So maybe a few less wells this quarter. Are those going to \u2013 and your previous guide for the fourth quarter is 58 wells. Is that just a little bit of timing there? Any issues in terms of fracture, spread availability, et cetera.","Steven Schlotterbeck","Yes. So no issues. What all \u2013 it is all timing. Those 5 or 6 that were late this quarter will shift into next quarter. I will tell you that we have 9 frac crews running now. So we have all the frac crews we need, all the rigs we need. And the reason that exit rate shifted up is just that we have noted that activity is shifting into the fourth quarter now.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Hall","Hi, thanks. I appreciate the follow-up. And it was just actually a follow-up on that last question. To be clear, the exit rate, is that a fourth quarter average? Or will that be \u2013 like an average between the fourth and first quarter?","David Schlosser","This is David. That's a December average.","Michael Hall","Okay, perfect.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Patrick Kane for closing comments.","Patrick Kane","Thank you, Rob, and thank you all for participating.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Patrick Kane, Chief Investor Relations officer. Please go ahead.","Patrick John Kane","Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today with me are Dave Porges, President and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Conti, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Randy Crawford, Senior Vice President and President of Midstream, Distribution and Commercial; and Steve Schlotterbeck, Senior Vice President and President of Exploration and Production.

Following Dave's remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy and Steve will all be available to answer your questions.","I would like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements related to the future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, filed with the SEC as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which were also filed with the SEC.","Today's call may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for our important disclosures regarding such measures including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","With that, I would like to turn it over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2013 earnings of $0.66 per diluted share, a 38% increase from EPS in the first quarter of 2012. Operating cash flow also increased by 34% to $304 million for the quarter. We had a very solid operational quarter including record produced natural gas sales as well as record gathering volumes at Midstream. The high level story for first quarter at EQT was strong volume growth coupled with lower unit cash cost in both the production and the Midstream businesses, which was partially offset by lower realized commodity prices.","Even though NYMEX was 22% higher than the previous year, we realized a lower effective natural gas price after accounting for the effect of our hedges as the number of higher-priced swaps and collars rolled off at the end of 2012. Also, NGL prices were 23% lower versus the same quarter last year.","Earnings at our distribution segment were higher than last year as a result of weather that was back to normal as compared to the record warm winter that we had last year. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partner results are consolidated within EQT Corporation's results, and EQT recorded $9 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests or $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter.","Moving on to the segments, starting with EQT Production operating results. The story in the quarter at EQT Production continues to be the growth in sales of produced natural gas. The growth rate, as you saw, was 47% in the recently completed quarter over the fourth -- first quarter of 2012. That growth rate was all organic and the growth was driven by sales from our Marcellus Shale play, which saw volume growth of 103% year-over-year. NGL volumes were also higher, 52%, versus last year. As I already mentioned, the average realized gas price was lower in the quarter. The realized price at EQT Production was $3.14 per MCFE compared to $3.59 per MCFE last year. At the corporate level, EQT received $4.27 per MCFE or 12% less than last year.","Produced liquids, excluding ethane, accounted for 6% of the volume and 23% of the unhedged revenues in the quarter. Total operating expenses at Production were $40 million or 29% higher, quarter-over-quarter. Higher DD&A expense accounted for $38 million of the $40 million increase and was driven by the volume growth, as the average completion rate was essentially unchanged.","Production taxes were $4.2 million lower, but I remind you that last year, in the first quarter, we recorded a $6.2 million charge related to  PA Impact Fees that was related to periods prior to 2012. Excluding that, EQT actually experienced an increase of $2 million in Production taxes consistent with the higher volumes. Other operating expenses at Production were $6 million or 18% higher. Since sales are growing at a significantly faster pace than expenses, per unit cost continue to obviously improve. Per unit LOE, excluding production taxes, was 20% lower at $0.16 per MCFE and per unit SG&A was 26% lower at $0.29 per MCFE.","Moving onto the Midstream business. Operating income here was up 32%. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission charges and increases in interruptible transmission volumes and revenue. Gathering net operating revenues increased by $12.6 million as gathering volumes increased by 42% in the quarter while the average gathering rate declined by 16%. The decline in rate continues to be driven by the increasing Marcellus mix. The Huron gathering fee remained unchanged at a $1.35 per MCF, while the average Marcellus gathering fee declined by 9% to $0.60 per MCF.","Transmission net revenues increased by $14.4 million while storage marketing and other net operating revenues was down $5.2 million in the first quarter. Margins at storage continue to deteriorate year-over-year due to the lack of winter-summer spread in the gas prices and low day-to-day volatility in gas prices.  Given current market conditions, we still estimate the full year 2013 net revenues in storage marketing and other will be approximately $30 million.","Net operating expenses at Midstream were $3.7 million higher quarter-over-quarter, mainly from higher depreciation expense consistent with our capital investments and growth. On a per unit basis, gathering and compression expense was down 32% to $0.19 per MCFE as a result of higher throughput while maintaining our cost structure. Based on the higher estimated volumes, we are increasing our 2013 EBITDA estimate at Midstream to between $350 million and $355 million.","Moving on to Distribution, operating income at Distribution was 29% higher after excluding $5 million of revenue applicable to prior periods recorded in the first quarter as a result of the completion of a routine purchased gas cost audit. Adjusted for that, the remaining increase in operating income is explained by weather, as I mentioned. First quarter 2013, weather was in line with the 30-year average but much colder than last year, which according to NOAA was the warmest first quarter on record in the service territory as measured by heating degree days. As a result, adjusted net operating revenue for the first quarter at Distribution in '13 was 16% higher, while operating expenses were essentially flat.","Final note on 2013 cash flow as a result of the higher forecasted natural gas prices for our unhedged volumes, we are increasing our operating cash flow estimate for 2013 to be approximately $1.1 billion based on the current strip. We did take advantage of the recent run up in natural gas prices to add to our hedge position for 2013 and 2014. We're approximately 60% hedged for the remainder of '13 and around 30% hedged for 2014. We exited the quarter with $160 million in cash on hand, no short-term debt and full availability under our $1.5 billion credit facility. So we remain in great liquidity position for 2013 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.","David L. Porges","Thank you, Phil. As Phil summarized, operationally, we are coming off another record quarter with record volumes at Production and Midstream. Before discussing business operations, I will update you on several housekeeping items. First, we have a status update on the regulatory reviews related to the sale of our gas utility, Equitable Gas Company. April 22 marked the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The Federal Trade Commission has completed its assessment of the proposed transaction and we are free to proceed from an HSR perspective. We've also submitted filings with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, West Virginia Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and we'll soon file with the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Each of which must approve the transaction as part of the regulatory process. We continue to expect to receive all necessary approvals by year-end.","Second, MLP drops. We intend to execute a significant drop in the third quarter as planned. We expect that EQT Midstream Partners funding of the acquisition will include the issuance of additional equity units. As we have discussed before, the MLP becomes eligible to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC in early July, and we expect that it will file such a shelf registration at that time, in order to start the SEC registration process. The registration statement, once declared effective by the SEC, will allow for the issuance of equity and debt. If the SEC review is uneventful, we expect to be able to complete the drop in the third quarter as previously discussed.","Now on previous calls, we have discussed the possibility of doing a very small drop in the first half of 2013. As we prepared for the so-called test drop, we realized that the time commitment and fixed cost related to a small drop are quite similar to those related to a larger drop. Therefore, we decided not to proceed with the small drop but rather focus our efforts on a successful large drop in the second half of the year. In anticipation of your questions related to specific timing and size of the third quarter drop, please keep in mind that SEC rules limit what we're allowed to discuss in advance of security offerings and intend to comply with those restrictions. What I can say, which we have said in the past, is that we intend to fund our Midstream CapEx investments and proceeds from drops to -- with  proceeds from the drops to EQT Midstream Partners.","My third housekeeping item is that we finished frac-ing our first Utica well as planned. And it is \tshut-in waiting for gathering line, which is on schedule for midyear. We completed drilling our second Utica well and we'll be frac-ing it soon. And we will spot a third Utica well this month.","Finally, as has been our normal, we're providing Production sales guidance for the current quarter. Based on our current pad completion schedule, we expect second quarter Production sales to be approximately 85 Bcfe.","Now I want to return to our operations. As I said, the first quarter was another very good quarter for EQT. Production exceeded its business plan on both revenues and expenses, driven by volumes that exceeded guidance by 4%. The increased volumes flowed through our Midstream gathering and transmission systems driving the growth in those businesses. And Equitable Gas Company demonstrated its ability to earn a solid return when Mother Nature cooperates. We had our first normal winter in sometime, void by a persistently colder and normal March, and I add that note for the benefit of those of you who did not have the pleasure of experiencing it firsthand.  And the results reflect the commitment our team has to providing safe and reliable service to our utility customers.","Production volumes were higher than expected -- higher than expectations from turning pads and lines faster than planned from wells performing better than expected. We have discussed the lumpiness of Production growth resulting from the specific timing of turning pads and lines, and I will not bore you with the results from every pad, but I do wish to share some examples. In Greene County, we turned in line an 8-well pad with an average length of 5,800 feet starting at the end of October. The 30-day IP of the pad was 116 million cubic feet or 14.5 million cubic feet per well per day. While too early to estimate precisely, this corresponds to an EUR of 15 Bcfe per well or 2.6 Bcfe per thousand feet of padding. Other Greene County pad was turned in line in December. This pad had 4 wells on an average length of 7,300 feet. The 30-day IP was 94.1 million cubic feet per day or 23.5 million cubic feet per well per day. This corresponds to an EUR of 14.3 Bcfe per well or just under 2 Bcfe per thousand feet of padding. To help you with the math, that's 6.25 Bcf total production from the first month of production from just those 2 pads.","Shifting to West Virginia, recently, we have been getting a lot more questions from investors about our position in this state. As many of you know, we have been bullish on West Virginia for some time. Our drilling activity there, which represents 55% of our 2013 Marcellus drilling, is focused in our liquids-rich acreage in Doddridge, Ritchie and Wetzel counties, where we have approximately 80,000 acres. We have begun implementing reduced cluster spacing in Doddridge and Ritchie with tremendous initial success. In Doddridge, we have 8 wells frac-ed with reduced cluster spacing and online for more than 30 days. These wells are significantly shorter than we prefer due to some land issues as they average 2,900 feet in lateral pay, but the results are still impressive. The average 30-day IP was 8 million cubic feet per well per day, which corresponds to an EUR of 5.7 Bcfe per well or just under 2 Bcfe per 1,000 feet of pay.","As a footnote, all of the EUR estimates I am quoting for wet gas using industry norm of converting extracted liquids to MCFE at a ratio of 6 MCFE per barrel. The quoted EURs in the wet areas would be higher still if we assumed all ethane in the gas stream were extracted and, therefore, converted at that ratio.","In Ritchie, we only have 5 wells online with an average length of 5,640 feet, 2 were frac-ed using 30-foot spacing and 3 with 60-foot spacing. The average 30-day IP was 9.2 million cubic feet per well per day, which corresponds to an EUR of 11 Bcfe per well or just under 2 Bcfe per 1,000 feet of pay.","In Wetzel, we also only have 5 wells online, all frac-ed with 60-foot spacing. The average length per well is 3,680 feet. The average 30-day IP in Wetzel was 7.4 million cubic feet per well per day, which corresponds to an EUR of 7.3 Bcfe per well or 2 Bcfe per 1,000 feet of pay. We are testing 30-foot cluster completions in Wetzel this year.","As you can see, when we normalize for lateral length, which is how we evaluate well productivity internally, these 17 West Virginia wells, with EURs per 1,000 feet of just under 2 Bcfe, are more productive than our Tier 1 average, which is 1.7 Bcfe per 1,000 feet. And the economics are enhanced by the liquids content and by the higher energy content of the residual gas stream.","As you read in this morning's press release or as you've read in this morning's press release, we increased our 2013 Production sales volume guidance to be 33% higher than last year, and we initiated 2014 guidance at nearly 30% growth over the midpoint of the higher 2013 target. To remind you, 2013 Production is primarily determined by our 2012 drilling program and, similarly, 2014 is largely determined by our 2013 program. That is why we are confident giving our preliminary 2014 guidance. As we look at our extensive Marcellus inventory in both Pennsylvania and West Virginia, we are confident that our assets can support growth of more than 20% for several years.","Furthermore, with proceeds from the sale of the utility and a continued source of capital through drops of Midstream assets to EQM, we are in strong financial shape and have visibility on sourcing the needed capital.","In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments, and we are doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and we appreciate your continued support.","And with that, I'll turn the call over back to Pat.","Patrick John Kane","Thank you, Dave. Amy, let's open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Steve or Dave, I'm just wondering, first, just turning to the bit of the Utica that you have, you mentioned about going after and drilling the third well. Wondering, given the acreage that you have as far as kind of lateral length design, what, ultimately, you want to do and if you continue to rest those wells, kind of like a lot of the peers, 60 days or so?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes, Neal, this is Steve. Regarding the resting, I think we're kind of open-minded about that. I think we're going to test it and see, and sort of by necessity on these first wells since we're waiting on the gathering system, they will be rested. So we may...","David L. Porges","Well rested.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well rested, yes. So we expect to start flowing those wells midyear. Regarding lateral length, I think we're still believers that in all these shale plays, longer is better. So we drill as long as we can, given the acreage position we have. I think on this first group of wells, I don't have a specific number, but on average, the lateral lengths are fairly long, north of 5,000 feet per well. So we're pretty happy about that.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And I know you've probably said you liked to maybe go after more data, just wondering if you could comment, Steve, about how that's going? And, again, I know you previously said that you would rather do it in the liquid side. Would you entertain looking at some of the Utica more on the eastern dry gas side or just stay more in the fairway?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Well, I think it's all interesting to us, and we monitor results from our competitors who have more data than we have at this point. But I think we're pretty confident in our drilling and completion capabilities. So if good results are coming out of the gasier side of the play, that would certainly be of interest. I think we view similarly to how we view the Marcellus drier gas areas. But for now, our current acreage is in the wetter part of the Utica, and we're going to wait for results like everybody else and see what we have.","David L. Porges","Neal, you had mentioned the liquids. And actually, just to clarify, we tended to be more interested in wet gas at the areas that kind of get into the, if you will, condensate window. We haven't really been all that interested in the so-called black oil part of the play, at least not to date.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great clarification. Thanks, Dave. And then just last question. You guys continue to have just great results, continue to expand, particularly, in the Marcellus, but wondering, Steve, if you could comment about the design on the Upper Devonian, seems like even those results sort of continue to expand. So I guess, number 1, basically using the same technique, complacent -- drilling and complacent techniques there as you do in the Marcellus. And 2, if so, what are we talking as far as drilling locations? It sounds like that could really pick up materially given all your -- even the Devonian potential on top of the Marcellus?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Neal, I think, first, I want to remind you that it's very early in our experimentation of that, so we only have a handful of wells. But it is something we're pretty excited about. And you can see, we're continuing to drill probably even a little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be in terms of numbers of Upper Devonian wells at this point in the year. When we look at that, we think we have, at the current time, with limited information, about 170,000 acres that are perspective. We are using similar techniques, not always exactly the same techniques. It depends on the geology and the mineralogy of the reservoir. And I think we will have to experiment to see what the appropriate lateral spacing and stage spacing is in the Upper Devonian. So there's still a lot of variables that are unknown to us in terms of quantifying the total resource potential. But I think our best guess right now is 170,000 acres, we think, will be economic. And that's -- we'll start off with 1,000 foot spacing and see if it makes sense to go closer than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Richardson at Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Richardson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Quick question. Just appreciate all the color, particularly around West Virginia and the Greene County results. In context of your comments, David, can you help us a little bit on the -- I noticed your latest investor presentation, Slide 34, which looks like it was just reposted, you still have the same tiering and type curves that's been there for some time, if I'm not mistaken. Can you talk a little bit about not only in terms of where in the tiering we could see some upside, but also where in that tiering too we should be thinking about reduced cluster impact in terms of on impacts on EURs. So I guess 2 kinds of drivers there and, again, where would the upside be?","David L. Porges","We're always relooking at those. I recognize that it's not -- perhaps they're not completely keeping up with current results. Some of what we discussed of course had to do with new results in from West Virginia, in particular, but also in how we wind up characterizing the liquids. And we're trying to provide information on EUR that is more consistent, say, with what other folks have done. So I think it's kind of a watch-this-space type of thing. We will continue to look at what those type curves are to make sure that they are reflecting the -- our current thought process. But I'd say, probably, the biggest issue that we've got is making sure that we bring our way of characterizing the liquids a little bit more in into line with folks in the industry have done. And that's the reason that we have quoted the EURs and the EURs per foot the way we did.","Stephen Richardson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just as a follow-up I guess, is 122-acre spacing the right way to be thinking about Greene County?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","We don't really like to talk about acres per well. It's driven so much by lateral length and lateral spacing. So I think right now, in Greene County, it's looking like, in the bulk of Greene County 500-foot lateral spacing, and we try and drill as long as we can. But the spacing per well for a 10,000-foot well is twice the acreage than it is for a 5,000-foot well. So it's not a term we use internally very much, but I think I would maybe use our average spacing of around -- or length of 5,000 feet with 500-foot lateral spacing as a reasonable approximation of our per well drainage.","Stephen Richardson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. Thanks for the clarification. One more, if I could, was, could you give us, just a little bit, perhaps on 2014, what we should expect directionally in terms of CapEx to go with that production number at this point. I know it's a little early, but is that the right assumption?","David L. Porges","I'd rather not give guidance on that, only because the board is the, obviously, the group that approves that. Our real point in providing the 2014 guidance now was that 2014 production isn't really that dependent upon 2014 capital. It's a pretty small amount of capital relative to, say, what the total that we're spending this year that would be required to hit that kind of guidance. But as we mentioned with these multi-well pads with long laterals, there is a relatively long lead time. So you really do have to look, we think, at least, the way we conduct the operation, you have to look at 2013 capital and results to kind of get a sense of what 2014 volumes are going to be like. The 2014 capital is going to have much more impact on the 2015 volumes. But certainly we do have the liquidity to -- I mean, we have the liquidity certainly to continue spending at the pace that we've been spending.","Operator","Next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth at BMO Capital Markets.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You mentioned that you drilled 6 Upper Devonian wells in the quarter. I don't think you talked about any results. Are any of those wells on sale, then could you talk about the results that you've seen from those?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I think we've turned in line a couple of those, but we're -- it's too early to talk about the results.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then in the Utica, you talked about targeting at least 50,000 net acres. With gas prices having moved up and also chatter about some pretty strong results out of the dry gas window, is that something that you would consider targeting in your leasing efforts or you're still focused in the wet gas part of the play?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","Yes. I mean, I think our -- we do have an interest in consolidating the position that we have. And the dry gas area would be a separate area that, again, we monitor the results and, at some point, we may find that attractive, but for now we're focused on our core Marcellus position and building a position in the area where we have Utica acreage that give us enough scale to be efficient.","David L. Porges","And of course, as you know, we do have a fair amount of dry Utica acreage that's under our Marcellus acreage. The issue isn't just that it's dry though. It's that as we move further to the east, it's deeper. So it increases the costs. So it's not just the fact that the gas is dry that causes some concern. It's that it's deeper. And certainly I'll mention that the front part of the curve has moved up a lot. The back hasn't really moved up that much. So we've got a pretty flat curve, which is good for cash flows and good for economics, because it brings cash flows forward, but it doesn't materially impact how you view longer-term prospects.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Got it, makes sense. And then on the RCS in West Virginia, you previously talked about 1\/3 of the acreage -- 1\/3 of your Marcellus acreage can be developed using RCS. Were you concluding the West Virginia wells in that 1\/3 or is that incremental?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck","I don't recall what exactly what went into the 1\/3, but I can tell you that we are now doing reduced cluster spacing in the bulk of the areas we're drilling in West Virginia, and really -- so Doddridge and Richie. And in Wetzel, we are currently experimenting with it. But I would say I have high confidence that 30-foot clusters is going to prove to be the preferred method in Wetzel County. So I think in the areas we're currently drilling in West Virginia, the percentage of RCS completions will be very high.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And last question on EQM, I think you'd previously talked about targeting a coverage ratio of 1.1x. In the first quarter, it was closer to 1.9. Is 1.1 still the longer-term target we should expect there?","Philip P. Conti","That certainly was the target we talked about when we marketed the deal. It's going to vary quarter to quarter. We tend to look at it as we think about distributions going forward a year or so. I don't think we have an exact target, but something a little north of 1.1 is probably the right number in the near term.","David L. Porges","As I think we kind of hit it. There's no doubt the desire with increases in distribution per unit is to try to find a rhythm that we could get into with some regularity to it as opposed to just having it match one quarter's results.","Operator","The next question comes from Holly Stewart at Howard Weil.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","First question maybe for Phil. So I guess could you just talk about the progress on the tax implications for the LDC sale, maybe any incremental thoughts about final sale proceeds?","Philip P. Conti","No, we're not prepared to talk about that at all. We're still working through some of that. I think when we have the conference call for the deal, we talked about, I think, basis of $160 million, and we would expect to pay roughly 20% on deemed purchase price above that. But we're not really ready to say anything more about that. At this time, we're still working through some things in terms of like kind exchange, et cetera, and it's just too early to talk about it.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then Dave, maybe you could comment on just kind of final use of proceeds after the LDC sale is finalized and then the drop-down process sort of begins?","David L. Porges","Yes. I don't know that I have anything to add on what we would do with proceeds from the EGC sale. I'd still rather see that transaction go through the rest of the approvals. I mean, as you know, we did tend to focus a little bit more on the FDC approval only because of the unique history of these assets, but for the most part, what you focus on with gas utility M&A transactions are the public utility commission -- public service commission approvals, and we're still in the relatively early days of those. So we're still kind of working -- even though -- so, it's great for us that we're over this one hurdle that had been an issue in the past, but now it turns into a more standard LDC M&A process. So I just assume not get ahead of ourselves there. We're just trying to create value, monetize reserves the way we can, and I know if you're looking at acreage issues, it's mainly what we're prioritizing still, it's trying to see if there are opportunities to build around our current strong business. We're still in the so-called donut holes, those sorts of things.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. I was just trying to -- I mean, it's a high-  class problem to have, but just kind of thinking about as you enter 2014, you're going to have cash coming in from the LDC sale as well as the start of more significant drop-downs. So just kind of thinking bigger picture, again, high-class problem to have, but you will have a lot of incremental cash coming in the door.","David L. Porges","That's true. And I guess the message that we're trying to send through is that we will be disciplined about capital. We've been disciplined about it for the last, geez, as long as I've been here, which is -- it's amazing but it's coming up on 15 years now. And we're not going to let money burn a hole in our pocket. That's kind of what we're focused on as much as anything is, a lot of these transactions are ones we enter into, because we think they're the right thing to do, not because we've got something else that we need to raise up and spend the money on. Look, I mean, and that's a couple of people pointed out, with more -- with some improvements and what the Marcellus results have been, with the Upper Devonian, et cetera, may well be the that there's other opportunities down the road to increase the development, but we just assume, take a look at that based on the operational results.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Absolutely. Okay. And then maybe, Dave, just a strategic update around that Huron asset process that's been ongoing.","David L. Porges","Well, it is certainly true, notwithstanding my comments of the prior call or about the back end of the curve not really having moved up much, that the tenor of the discussions and the M&A front are probably a little brighter when you've got higher front month and front year prices. So we would certainly hope that we might be able to get something done, but I don't have anything in particular to report. Well, I guess one thing I will reiterate that, I think, we've said a bit is, at these prices, at least the Huron is economically -- it is economically attractive to invest. It's not as economically attractive to invest in the Huron as it is in the Marcellus, and of course we do have a higher cost of capital than the Sandy and MLP [ph] would have, because we enter into a higher-risk, higher-return type of activities than all those folks do. But it does clear our hurdle rates the way we have them set right now as a result of the increasing gas prices. So we're hoping that, that will lead to some opportunities along the lines that we've talked about strategically for the Huron, but we don't have anything to report on it right now.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.","David L. Porges","Thank you, Amy, and thank you, all, for participating.","Operator","The conference has concluded.

The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415. The confirmation code is 13650786. The call will also be replayed for 7 days on our website.","To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM; EQGP; RMP are consolidated into EQT\u2019s results. Earlier this morning, there is a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. EQM and EQGP will have a joint earnings conference call today at 11:30, which requires us to the last question on this call at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call if you are interested is 201-689-7817. In a moment, Rob, Dave and Steve present their prepared remarks. Following these remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave, Jerry and Blue will all be available to answer your questions.","I would like to remind you that today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today\u2019s press release and under Risk Factors in EQT\u2019s Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2016 which will be filed with the SEC later today. Today\u2019s call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning\u2019s press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including the reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.","And now, I would like to turn over the call to Rob McNally.","Rob McNally","Thanks, Pat and good morning everybody. As you read in the press release this morning EQT announced 2017 adjusted income of $1.47 per diluted share compared to a $0.33 loss in 2016. In the fourth quarter, EQT recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion to revalue existing net tax liabilities to the lower 21% tax rate, which is excluded from adjusted EPS. A year-over-year mark-to-market swing of $639 million and other items that affect comparability are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release and are also excluded from adjusted EPS.","Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to $833 million in 2016. The increase in both earnings and cash flow were primarily due to an increase in commodity prices and sales volume. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners, Rice Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation\u2019s results. EQT recorded $350 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interest in 2017, including $99 million in the fourth quarter.","There were several highlights in 2017. Including the acquisition of Rice Energy, the receipt of the FERC certificate for Mountain Valley Pipeline, production volume growth of 17%, average realized price improvement of 23% and the successful $3 million debt issuance with part of the proceeds used to refinance Rice debt, saving EQT approximately $45 million in interest expense in 2018.","Now, taking a look at the fourth quarter which included Rice starting on the November 13, fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EPS was $0.76 per diluted share compared to $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT was $416 million in the fourth quarter compared to $332 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter production sales volumes were 48% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016, while commodity prices were 4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016.","Moving on to the results by business segment, it is important to note at this time that following the Rice merger, EQT now reports through five business segments: EQT Production, EQM Gathering, EQM Transmission, RMP Gathering and RMP Water. More details about these business segments can be found in our 10-K which we expect to file later today. So starting with the production results, I will keep my comments on production volumes light as David is going to go into the details a bit in his comments. For the year EQT Production achieved production sales volumes of 887.5 Bcfe, a 17% increase over 2016. Average realized price was $3.04 per Mcfe for 2017, which was $0.57 or 23% higher than last year. Full year adjusted operating revenues at EQT Production were $2.7 billion, a 44% improvement year-over-year, primarily attributable to increased production and improved prices. Total operating expenses were $2.5 billion or 19% higher year-over-year primarily due to increased volume growth. More details about full year operating expenses can be found in our press release and our 10-K filing.","Now on to quarterly results, as mentioned sales were 48% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. The majority of this increase is related to the acquisition of Rice producing wells after closing the deal on November 13. The fourth quarter 2017 average realized price was $3.04 per Mcfe, a 4% increase compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating revenue for the production company totaled $896 million for the fourth quarter and $318 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating expenses were $781 million, $204 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016, which is consistent with increased volume growth and expenses associated with recent acquisitions.","Now moving on to midstream results, full year 2017 operating income for EQM Gathering was $334 million, up $45 million year-over-year primarily due to increased gathering volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses. Operating revenues were $455 million for the year, up $57 million over 2016. Total operating expenses for the year were $121 million, up $13 million over 2016. EQM Gathering\u2019s fourth quarter operating income was $91 million, $20 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter operating revenues were $124 million a $23 million increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 while operating expenses were $33 million, a $3 million increase over the fourth quarter of 2016.","EQM Transmission\u2019s full year 2017 operating income was $247 million, up $9 million year-over-year. Total operating revenues were $380 million, $42 million higher than the 2016, while operating expenses for the year were $132 million, $22 million higher than in 2016, excluding the $10 million non-cash charge to depreciation and amortization expense. Fourth quarter income was $58 million, down $6 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $101 million for the quarter, a $6 million increase over the fourth quarter of 2016, while operating expenses were $43 million, $1 million increase over the fourth quarter of 2016, again excluding the $10 million non-cash charge to depreciation and amortization expense.","Now shifting gears to RMP Gathering and RMP Water results. The results included in our press release and 10-K filing of the period of November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017. RMP gathering reported an operating income of $21.8 million, while RMP Water reported an operating income of $4.1 million.","Lastly, I would like to discuss our cash flow and liquidity position. As of December 31, 2017, EQT had $1.3 billion of borrowing and a $159 million of letters of credit outstanding under our $2.5 billion credit facility. We closed the year with about $134 million of cash in the balance sheet, excluding EQM and RMP. We currently forecast $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion of adjusted operating cash flow for 2018 at EQT, which includes approximately $325 million to $375 million from EQT\u2019s interest in EQGP and RMP. This represents an increase of $300 million from our December forecast. The change is primarily due to the impact of the new tax laws. In December, we expected cash taxes of about $70 million. We now expect a cash refund of about $200 million. This forecast assumes a Nymex price of $2.77 in an average differential of negative $0.27. With our forecasted adjusted operating cash flow, we expect to fully fund our forecasted 2018 capital expenditure plan, which is about $2.4 billion.","So with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Schlosser","Thanks, Rob and good morning everyone. I would like to start by providing some color around the 2017 sales volume and our guidance for 2018. Immediately after close of the Rice transaction, we began operating the combined assets as the single entity utilizing our resources to optimize overall development plan regardless of their legacy. We entered 2017 with pro forma sales volume of 1,317 Bcfe, which was consistent with the guidance we provided on the pro forma company. In December, our first full month as an integrated entity we averaged approximately 4 Bcfe per day also in line with our expectations despite taking some operational challenges on the extreme cold snap late in the month.","Based on current line scheduled for the year, we expect the quarterly volume profile for 2018 to look like this. Q1 will average approximately 4 Bcfe per day consistent with our first quarter guidance of 350 to 360 Bcfe. We then expect to see sequential quarterly increases in Q2, Q3 and Q4. We are reiterating our full year volume guidance of 1,520 to 1,560 Bcfe, which will result in volume growth of 17% over pro forma 2017.","I would now like to provide an update on our overall Rice integration efforts. Rice employed an outstanding team of oil and gas professionals and EQT retained more than 150 of them for our upstream operations. This influx of talent has brought fresh ideas and perspectives to help refine processes and implement new technical approached. We have hit the ground running with our increased lateral lengths and in 2018, our Pennsylvania, Marcellus spuds are expected to average over 13,600 feet. This is 1,000 foot longer than what we announced in December and as a direct result of collaboration between land professionals from both companies. In fact, 60% of our Marcellus wells in Pennsylvania will be comprised of wells that share legacy EQT and Rice acreage.","On the operational technical front, we are combining best practices and have already captured value. For example, Rice had a significant frac sand sourcing and logistics effort, which we leverage to improve efficiency \u2013 pricing and efficiency across our factories. On the drilling side, we have set new footage records by combining the data, experience and practices of both companies, more specifically related to rotary steerable systems and drill pipe rotation. And finally, we have seen promising results from early testing of new concepts. We are on the landing point of our Marcellus laterals. So far, I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made during just 3 short months and I look forward to continue to blend best practices, promote innovation and deliver best-in-class economic returns. We will keep you updated during the year on the progress of these initiatives.","Now, let\u2019s move on to year end reserves. EQT\u2019s year end 2017 proved reserves increased 59% to 21.4 Tcfe versus year end 2016. Obviously, the Rice acquisition in November and several smaller acquisitions throughout the year had significant impact on our reserve growth adding 6.3 Tcfe in proved reserves. EQT\u2019s drilling effort added an additional 2.2 Tcfe to the proved total through extensions and other additions. As you would expect, development costs continued to improve as we lengthened laterals. Our 2017 Marcellus program had a development cost of $0.60 per net Mcfe, a 17% decrease when compared to the 2016 figure of $0.72 per net Mcfe.","Excluding acquisitions, we replaced 245% of our 2017 production and when we include the impact of acquisitions, our replacement percentage increases to 974%. We have stressed the traffic and capital economic synergies of the Rice acquisition and our PUD reserves reflect the impact of these synergies. As you know, the SEC limits PUD reserve to those reserves we expect to develop in the next 5 years. Rice acquisition allowed us to reprioritize our 5-year development plan in order to focus on developing longer, more economic laterals first. Many shorter locations were removed from the plan, but remain economic and we expect to develop those locations outside of the 5-year \u2013 required 5-year window. Finally driven by acquisitions and pricing, probable and possible reserves have also increased significantly with probable reserves up 40.3 Tcfe and possible reserves up 4.9 Tcfe. The Marcellus account for 80% of those increases.","With that I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Schlotterbeck","Thank you, David. Good morning everyone. On last earnings call for the third quarter 2017 was just a few weeks before the shareholder vote to approve the Rice transaction. With this being our first call since completing the acquisition, I want to thank our shareholders for their support and reiterate the commitments that we made to you. We committed to establishing a Board committee to evaluate options for addressing sum of the parts discount and to announce a plan by the end of the first quarter of 2018. The committee\u2019s work is ahead of schedule and we will announce a plan by the end of February. And we intend to implement the plan on an accelerated basis. We committed to adding two new independent Directors to the Board with midstream experience and to include these new Directors on the committee tasked with the sum of the parts review.","On November 13 we added Tom Karam and Norm Szydlowski to the Board. Both of whom have extensive midstream experience, are active Board members and on the committee reviewing the sum of the parts. We committed to moving the Director nomination deadline to after the sum of the parts decision announcement. We will move the 2018 nomination window to follow the sum of the parts decision and announce specific dates by the end of February. And we have removed volume growth as a metric from future compensation plans and have replaced it with return on capital and operating and development cost metrics. Finally, we are committed to delivering on our synergy targets established for the Rice acquisition. As you read in our December capital budget news release, we have hit the ground running and have started capturing the various synergies related to the transaction.","As David said, we currently expect to average 13,600 foot laterals in Southwestern Pennsylvania Marcellus acreage, which is 1,600 feet or 13% longer than we anticipated when the deal was first announced. This places us ahead of schedule for achieving our capital synergies. In addition, I am pleased to say that our G&A savings began on day one. Our integration team had a detailed staffing plan and we are able to retain many talented Rice employees while still achieving our staffing targets. As we continue blending the best of two cultures, we are confident that the exchange of ideas will result in continuous improvements to our programs and practices.","Finally, I strongly believe that the current share price does not reflect the tremendous value we have created and we will continue to create going forward. We have built an E&P business that can grow production in estimated 15% per year utilizing funds within cash flow. The E&P business has an industry leading cost structure and controls over 680,000 core acres in the premier gas basin in North America. We have also built a premier midstream business that continues to deliver tremendous capital efficient growth. Our midstream business has a solid balance of long FERC regulated pipelines and the network of gathering assets, sitting at top the lowest cost natural gas reserves in the U.S. The financial leverage metrics at both our E&P and midstream businesses are extremely well, amongst the best in the industry in each case.","Over the past 10 years, we have created tremendous value to the growth of both of these businesses. However, this value has not been reflected in EQT share price. Our plan to address the discount will be designed to deliver this value to shareholders and to create the opportunity for value creation at EQT into the future. To reiterate, the committee is ahead of schedule and I expect to announce our plan by the end of February and we will implement the plan on the accelerated basis.","With that I will turn it over to Pat for Q&A.","Pat Kane","Thank you, Steve. Kevin, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly sir, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Holly Stewart from Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is now live.","Holly Stewart","Good morning gentlemen.","Steve Schlotterbeck","Good morning Holly.","Holly Stewart","Maybe just quickly on the announced acceleration maybe what\u2019s driven the faster timeline?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Well, I think it\u2019s hard to predict how much work will be involved and the committee has been working very diligently and has been able to evaluate the various options and come to conclusions a little faster than we predicted, which I think is good. So still little more work to do, but we are zeroing in and very comfortable saying that we expect to be done by the end of February rather than the end of March.","Holly Stewart","Great. And should we expect a conference call with that announcement?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Yes, I think there will be a conference call for sure.","Holly Stewart","Okay, great. And then maybe Steve just on Ohio, now that you have had a little bit of time at least to kind of see that asset base first hand, any comments at this point on the position there?","David Schlosser","Holly, this is David. I will answer that. I mean I think we had a little time, but it has been real time, I mean we are going to drill the 45 gross wells that we have talked about in December. And I think 2018 to be a year that we really formally understanding of the asset and then figure out how we are going to move forward. So that\u2019s really what I will get to say I guess.","Holly Stewart","Okay. And then just one final one for me, maybe since we have got blue on the call this time, just your thoughts around your exposure to the Southeast market seeing in the deck you have got it looks like up any premium to NYMEX, I wouldn\u2019t share if that\u2019s just strip forecast or you are locking that in or planning to lock in that in some how?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Yes. Hi Holly, it\u2019s a combination of both as we look forward to the supply demand in that area and we look a course of the premiums that exist across part of that region. What you see is in netted back results of transactions that we have in place as well as the combination of the balance of the forward strip. So it\u2019s a bit above.","Holly Stewart","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","David Schlosser","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Mr. Venker, perhaps your phone is on mute.","Drew Venker","Good morning, everyone. I was just hoping you could speak to any, I think for the progress made on MVP in the last outstanding products there if you were required to get to that as to proceed?","Steve Schlotterbeck","MVP, up-tick.","David Schlosser","Yes. So on the MVP, we basically put it in a \u2013 instead of a bundle, we were went with 10 different notices to proceed. We have put in all 10 as of this morning. We have gotten eight of those. That\u2019s allowed us to do both West Virginia and Virginia work. We started the construction process last week. And before that we were able to get work to kick us off two weeks ago with their help. So we feel really confident about the pipeline schedule and we feel really confident about our December 31, 2018 startup day.","Drew Venker","Okay. Thanks for that guys.","David Schlosser","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, as it relates to the clinical accelerated implementation of the some of the parts plan, can you provide any context as to how we should think about that timeline?","Steve Schlotterbeck","I cannot, all I can say is we will provide more details when we get to the announcement. All I really intend to convey at this point is we are committed to taking care of the sum of the parts discount as quickly as possible. So we see no reason to delay. Once we announce the plan, we can talk more details about the timeline.","Michael Hall","Okay. Is it reasonable to expect that it\u2019s something that could be done by year end?","Steve Schlotterbeck","I can\u2019t comment on that at this time.","Michael Hall","Fair enough, understood, I guess on the topic of returns and system the compensation metrics, I was wondering if you have got to look at the upstream only business, return on capital employed, how that looks in \u201818 and what you think a reasonable target for that might be in 2020?","Steve Schlotterbeck","I don\u2019t have those figures at my fingertips, Michael, so, but we could \u2013 you want to get with Pat that after the call, we could probably get that to you.","Michael Hall","Okay. That\u2019s something you might be willing to target formally with \u2013 in the context of the some of the parts plan as you guys announced that, is that in your mind or is that?","Steve Schlotterbeck","I would rather hold off on anything related to some of the parts plan until we announce it and then I think that would be an appropriate question that I could answer that.","Michael Hall","Alright. I will try something on my guess.","Steve Schlotterbeck","Maybe you rephrase it.","Michael Hall","How about just cash tax benefits from the tax policy change, 2018 is provided pretty clearly, but just make sure we are thinking about the full impact of that through 2020 or 2021, how much total cash benefit were you getting from that?","Rob McNally","Yes, I mean, I think we have studied in the release that it\u2019s somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 million that we think should be refunded over the over the 2-year period.","Michael Hall","Okay, great. I will leave it at that. Thanks for the time guys.","Steve Schlotterbeck","Okay. Thanks, Michael.","Rob McNally","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Sameer Panjwani from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now live.","Sameer Panjwani","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Steve Schlotterbeck","Good morning, Sameer.","Sameer Panjwani","As you look at the weakness in the equity over the past few weeks and I think you guys have previously highlighted line of sight to over $1 billion of proceeds from the dropdowns that retains midstream assets from the Rice acquisition and then kind of layering in the $300 million of free cash flow, it sounds like you are going to generate this year given the tax benefits, how do you guys think about share repurchases in the near-term?","Rob McNally","Yes, I think that\u2019s probably a better topic to discuss after we get through some of the parts announcement. I don\u2019t think there is really any color that we can give you right now that will make sense without that context.","Sameer Panjwani","Okay, thanks. And then I guess second question so it seems like your peers have started to bifurcate on their school of thought a little bit on growth versus takeaway capacity. We have seen some of them provide some long-term guidance on growth beyond what their contracted capacity is and others who are more closely matching the two. You guys obviously have a line of sight to Mountain Valley in the expansion potential there and our model, what kind of gives you a growth runway through 2020. So, few questions kind of come out of that, so first once you fill your pipeline capacity, how do you think about incremental growth? And then secondarily what\u2019s your appetite for contracting additional Greenfield takeaway capacity? And then last one how much running room do you think there is based on why via Brownfield expansions are by adding compression?","Steve Schlotterbeck","I will take the first part of that, Sameer regarding growth. I think we feel pretty comfortable with our takeaway position a bit beyond 2020, so probably into 2022 or \u201823 before we think serious consideration needs to be given to particularly Greenfield takeaway projects, but beyond 2023 for sure that\u2019s going to be a big part of the focus. Obviously we have to start thinking about that years before that day, but I think at this point, we feel like we have got a little time to get the Rice integrations on, get to some of the parts plan behind us, assess the situation and then take a hard look at what is the next wave of takeaway capacity out of the basin, but again I think from our perspective, we are good for a few work beyond your 2020 date. Blue, do you want to add any color to that?","Blue Jenkins","Yes, happy to add a couple of thoughts. I agree with Steve\u2019s comments. A couple of things that I might suggest that touched on your other questions, you would ask how much incremental might be available. When we look across the basin, from pipes that are in the ground are going in the ground, we would suggest there are probably 3 to 4 Bcf a day that could be incremental takeaway with capacity or small looping project given the slate of pipes that have gone in or are going in. You also mentioned you talked about Greenfield, I think Steve touched on that, I think the next wave of Greenfield presents a unique set of challenges from both the regulatory environment as well as the cost environment, but what is out there that we are actively doing is we are putting a portfolio in place with long-term markets to ensure that, that gas moves as well as we are picking up pieces in the open market of available capacity actively from current capacity holders who don\u2019t have as much clarity as you get out into the future. So, we are doing all of those things.","Sameer Panjwani","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Vikram Bagri from Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Vikram Bagri","Hey, good morning, guys. I apologize if I missed that. I was wondering if you should expect changes in corporate governance at sponsored entities as well, if ROIC bid total shareholder return and other metrics linked to midstream performance will be included in the comp structure. Is that part of the review as well?","Rob McNally","Yes, I think again that\u2019s a question that will be better answered in the context of the some of the parts announcement, but what Steve was talking about including return metrics in the comp packages, it was really focused on the upstream business.","Vikram Bagri","Okay, okay, understood. And I understand there are a number of possible outcomes from the ongoing strategic review, but it is sort of reasonable to assume that EQT\u2019s interest in midstream entity should probably get reduced over time. Does that change your hedging strategy at EQT in anyway? Would you look to hedge more or longer term instead of hedging less and there will be of any change in your hedging strategy going forward?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Well, Vikram, this is Steve. I think I am not going to answer in relation to potential outcome of the some of the parts, but I think regardless of that we are rethinking our hedging strategy given this shift to a business model, where we expect to live within cash flow and trying to take some volatility out of the business. So, we are looking at how should we hedge on the commodity side and also starting some discussions with our key suppliers about new ways to contract for the services we need that can potentially provide a cost hedge as well, so trying to find ways to lock in margin a little better than we have been able to in the past.","Vikram Bagri","Understood. And then just one last one for me, it looks like the new Hammerhead Pipeline project runs parallel to Sunrise Pipeline or traverses the same path. I believe Sunrise volumes must have been lower due to EVC coming online, is it possible to reverse that pipeline and if Hammerhead \u2013 once you build Hammerhead, what happens to Sunrise after the contracts expire on that pipeline?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Sure. I mean, the Hammerhead Pipeline as we have talked about is kind of that Q3 timeframe in 2020 and so it won\u2019t be able to use Hammerhead to move Pennsylvania volumes into West Virginia to really feed Mountain Valley Pipeline. Sunrise Pipeline basically gives us optionality in the Appalachian Basin you will also see other projects. We have got an organic backlog. Working with Blue and his team, we always are looking at how do we take volumes whether it\u2019s north, east, west or south to the best markets. So you will see both of those pipelines fully utilized.","Vikram Bagri","Okay, understood. Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. Hey, just a question on some operational stuff. There were some indications I guess in the prepared comments about seeing better results and defining new landing zones on the horizontal laterals. Can you give a little color on what sort of occurred that occurred to see that improvement or exactly what\u2019s going on there?","David Schlosser","Yes, so a little color, I mean first, this is David, what occurred exactly was we had always thought would happen, I hope it happened as we get the two technical groups together and discussing how they have approached their development and we have approached ours. We came up with this concept or we took this concept and considered even further. And it\u2019s very early in the process. We are very encouraged by the early results. But generally, it is staggering the Marcellus landing point across the pad and we are feeling that it\u2019s increasing our frac efficiency and basically cutting more of the rock. There are subtle changes. It\u2019s early in the process and we\u2019ll keep you posted during the year, but just a handful of wells right now that we are looking at.","Scott Hanold","Okay. And was this the initiative that was brought forward by the Rice I guess employees or is this something that you all saw and kind of further confirmed with obviously some of the data or process that they have gone through?","David Schlosser","So, it was brought forward by Rice employees and then getting our engineers working with theirs and seeing the data that they were looking at prompted us to continue testing it. So, it was definitely not a Rice idea.","Scott Hanold","Yes. Are there any other initiatives in light of this that has been brought forward that you are looking at or is this kind of one of the bigger ones?","David Schlosser","It\u2019s one of the bigger ones as far as affecting reserves right now. I mean, the other things I mentioned in the call, Rice, the drilling parameters of increasing our RPMs on our rotary steerable systems that was really bought forward by Rice. We had data that didn\u2019t look as positive when we got to see their data and discuss what the nuances of it with them we decided to try and then our first well we increased ROP by 8%. So, I mean, that was another Rice idea that we have brought forward and implemented on our own assets.","Steve Schlotterbeck","And Scott, I would say and the ideas actually go both ways, so there are some techniques that EQT was previously doing that we can apply now to the Rice acreage and yield benefits as well. So, it\u2019s as we expected. Both groups have tested different things and tried different techniques that we have different databases of results and we are going to yield value from having both of those databases available to technical folks to evaluate.","Scott Hanold","Okay, understood. And then my last question on some of the parts decision and just curious if you could just broadly provide a comment on this. I mean, would this also encompass a strategy on the upstream business long-term, for example, how you plan to grow like what\u2019s the appropriate growth rates and what\u2019s the appropriate amount of shareholder returns be it buybacks and\/or dividends, is that expected to be part of this discussion by the end of February?","Steve Schlotterbeck","I think I\u2019d rather not comment on that at this time Scott. Just, you are going to have to wait a few more weeks.","Scott Hanold","Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Steve Schlotterbeck","Brian, good morning.","Brian Singer","Can you give us a little bit more color on the synergies plan and implementing the synergies from the right transaction over the course of over 2018, just the areas of focus and potential benefits here now relative to where you expect to be at the end of the year?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Yes. So Brian, so we announced two primary synergies as that drove the deal one on the G&A side, we are at or little bit ahead of the plan that is delivered on that synergy. So, I think the annual savings is going to be a bit better than we anticipated.","David Schlosser","Yes. What we have said was we expected about $100 million of annual G&A savings, overhead savings and we think that number is going to be more like $110 million or maybe a little bit more than that for 2018.","Steve Schlotterbeck","And on the capital savings, the model assumed 12,000 foot laterals in the acquisition area and we now expect to average 13,600 feet. So, that\u2019s a pretty dramatic acceleration of those synergies and I don\u2019t have the PV benefit of that difference with me, but it\u2019s\u2026","David Schlosser","It\u2019s several hundred million dollars higher.","Brian Singer","Got it. Okay, thank you. And then on the Marcellus, you mentioned and we talked about it before the acreage acquisitions that are more on an ongoing basis and I think the number was about $740 million last year, excluding the Rice deal. Can you just talk about how we should think about acreage acquisitions over the course of 2018 and what that would add and just the market in general right now?","David Schlosser","This is David again. I think it\u2019s really consistent with the number we have already put out there. We expect around $150 million per year needed to acquire these small pieces of acreage to continue to lengthen laterals and fill in some blank spots. And so that\u2019s what I would expect for 2018.","Brian Singer","Okay. So $150 million is the need, but that should also be our expectation for you to actually do, I suppose it\u2019s something big\u2026.","David Schlosser","Yes, I would think so.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Jayaram","Good morning. I guess just 8 trading days until the big decision. My question really regards to the upgrade to your 2018 operating cash flow guidance is about $300 million, I assume that\u2019s primarily taxes, but I was wondering if you could go through that, Rob?","Rob McNally","Yes, it is primarily taxes. In December the \u2013 prior to the tax legislation change, we expected to pay about $70 million of cash taxes in 2018. Now we actually expect to get a refund of about $200 million, so that\u2019s $270 million of the $300 million. There are some other odds and ends which is really more around realized price and differential that makes up the balance. And I guess I should note that the \u2013 that $200 million that refund we expect to get, we won\u2019t actually receive that cash in 2018. That will be on the 2018 tax filings, we wont\u2019 receive until 2019.","Arun Jayaram","Got it. And just my follow-up question, Steve if you think about kind of the integration of the technical teams, you have obviously highlighted some recent benefits of that, what are some future things that you can you think about in terms of the ability to harness more synergies and improvements in terms of well productivities as you put the teams together?","Steve Schlotterbeck","Well, specifically regarding well productivity, that\u2019s always hard to project if we knew the answers we will be doing it. But I think we really only begun to scratch the surface of having the technical teams working together and really working the data from both sides. And it is as we expected, it makes sense that each company tested different techniques. Some work, some don\u2019t, but the data from all of those tests is very valuable. And then you can combine it with another set of tax, it can really yield some insight. So I am very optimistic that we will continue to find some opportunities as a result of the integration of the two teams that improve recoveries from the wells. And I think another area of focus for us over the next year or so and it is also driven by the consolidated nature of the operation now is around logistics. So we have a lot of rigs running. We have a lot of frac crews. We will produce a lot of gas. And with a lot of people in a small area and finding ways to make those logistics as efficient as possible, I think also will deliver some value and that will be on the operating cost side, not on the productivity side, the well productivity.","Arun Jayaram","And just my final question, you guys are getting a pretty nice sizable tax refund over the next couple of years and Steve how do you think about prioritizing kind of free cash flow generation, could you contemplate a buyback irrespective of what\u2019s going on with the strategic options that you are evaluating today and how does a potential buyback fit into your longer term plans?","Rob McNally","Yes. This is Rob and I think as we move forward and we are generating free cash flow, that returning cash to shareholders, whether that\u2019s in the form of dividends or buybacks will certainly be a topic that we spend a fair amount of time on. And I suspect that there will be a combination of the both alternatives as we move forward.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Pat Kane","Thank you, Kevin and thank you all for participating.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your presentation today."],"8892":["EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2019 10:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Blake McLean - SVP, IR and Strategy","Rob McNally - President and CEO","Jimmi Sue Smith - SVP and CFO","Blue Jenkins - EVP, Commercial, Business Development, IT and Safety","Gary Gould - EVP and COO","Conference Call Participants","Arun Jayaram - JP Morgan","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets","Gene Transco - Stifel","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Betty Jiang - Credit Suisse","Operator","Greetings, welcome to EQT Corporation's Q1 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.","I'll now turn the conference over to your host, Blake McLean, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.","Blake McLean","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining today's conference call. With me today are Rob McNally, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jimmi Sue Smith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Blue Jenkins, Executive Vice President, Commercial, Business Development, IT and Safety. In addition, it's a pleasure to have Gary Gould, our newly appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer joins us today.","The replay for today's call will be available for a seven-day period beginning this evening. The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415 with the confirmation code of 13685068. The call will also be replayed for seven days on our website. In a moment, Rob, Gary and Jimmi Sue will present their prepared remarks. Following these remarks we will take your questions.","I'd also like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. Actual results and future events may differ, possibly materially, from these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in today's press release and under Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as updated by our subsequent Form 10-Q's which are also on file with the SEC and available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob.","Rob McNally","Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Before we jump into the quarter, I would like to take a minute and thank our employees for their continued hard work, dedication and ongoing enthusiasm for EQT's transformation. I know change can sometimes be challenging, but when you have a group of talented professionals committed to doing what's right, we are already a step ahead and that much closer to achieving our goals.","On our earnings call in February, we discussed the Company's ongoing transformation into a leading pure play natural gas producer. As part of the transformation we reconstituted our leadership team, simplified our corporate structure from four public entities down to one and consistent with feedback received from shareholders, work to address EQT's sum of the parts discount through the midstream simplification transactions and the spin-off of Equitrans.","We also shifted our focus with the new emphasis on low cost operations, efficiency and free cash flow generation. Adding fresh perspectives and additional talent to both the Board and Executive team has been and continues to be instrumental in helping drive this shift in EQT's corporate culture. The strong financial and operational results we delivered in the first quarter are tangible signs that these positive changes are directly benefiting shareholders.","Put simply, cultural change is driving positive operational momentum, which is leading to strong financial results. I'm excited to update you on the significant progress that we have made in executing on the rigorous bottoms up operational plan that we announced in January. That plan is in action now with real operational momentum building, and it provides the best path forward to capitalize on EQT's world-class asset base and generate substantial and importantly, sustainable free cash flow.","We operated with a high level of focus and efficiency during the first quarter, resulting in improved performance over what we outlined in our fourth quarter earnings call. Production sales volume were 383 Bcfe, which is above guidance and up 13% from the first quarter of 2018 when adjusted for divestitures. The beat on production, which is largely driven by improved winter operations and were specifically attributable to more collaborative and proactive approach to water handling.","The remote locations of many of our wells coupled with dangerous winter weather and road conditions often leads to safety stand down on our water hauling fleet. This year, due to improved planning and advanced logic embedded in our water optimization model, we were able to proactively target critical production in tanks and minimize the impact to production and frac crew operations.","We continue to reduce drilling days through the simplification of our wellbore geometries, the fine tuning of procedures, mud properties and bottom hole assembly design. We've also incorporated a 24-hour engineering support from our real-time operation center, they have assisted in identifying issues and allowed us to prevent future problems while drilling.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, we averaged 1.11 days per thousand foot drilled. We brought that down to 0.87 days per thousand foot in January, 0.83 days in February and 0.79 days in March. Said another way, first-quarter performance was 25% better than that of the fourth quarter of 2018. On the frac side, our stages per crew per day also continued to improve. For the quarter, we averaged 30% more stages per crew than we did in the first quarter of 2018.","This is largely due to improvements in pad and logistics planning that were implemented late last year. Additionally, we partnered with our vendors to identify inefficiencies that have historically slowed down operations. As a result, we have achieved significant improvements in operating up time. A 30% improvement year-over-year is fantastic progress.","We are particularly proud of our operational improvements in drill-outs. We improved our average drill-out plugs per day by 71% in the first quarter of 2019 versus the first quarter of 2018 and we cut nearly three days off drill out times per 100 plugs. This was accomplished by working collaboratively with our contractors to optimize and simplify our bottom hole assembly design, as well as by refining the rigs, bits and fluid dynamics being utilized in the process. These improvements have continued and just last week we set an all-time EQT record by drilling out 43 frac plugs and cleaning out over 7500 feet in a 24-hour period, really great progress.","I'd now like to discuss some operational scheduling changes that we strategically implemented during the quarter, as a result of our increased efficiencies. Going into 2019, we had more rigs under contract and we needed to achieve our near-term operational and volume growth targets. As part of our ongoing effort to increase operational efficiencies and reduce costs, we were able to successfully negotiate a penalty free, early reduction to our horizontal rig count, which will result in approximately 30 fewer horizontal wells being drilled in 2019. As a result, we will also spud approximately 15 fewer wells in 2019.","Additionally, due to the operational efficiency gains that have been achieved within our completion operations, we now plan to frac approximately 10 more wells in 2019 with the same frac crew count. And finally, seven fewer wells are expected to be turned in line during 2019 as a result of non-operated activity by joint venture partners and a bit of timing.","This is all good news from a capital efficiency point of view. These operational changes will not impact our full year 2019 volumes or capital expenditures, but they will move us closer to an optimal resource count and development cadence and will enhance our capital efficiency as we move into 2020.","Over the last three months we've talked a lot about our target 10% initiative, which is aimed at driving incremental cash cost out of the system. This new team was appointed in the fourth quarter of 2018, we have already identified and are now capturing $150 million in annual cost savings, $50 million of which fall into our target 10% initiative.","In addition, as an organization we have identified and are pursuing over 100 projects that will further drive down cost. These projects vary in scale, but are largely centered around process organization, elimination of redundancies, enhanced engineering designs and the procurement of goods and services.","As you all know, in March, we announced the appointment of Gary Gould as our Chief Operating Officer. Gary is a great addition to our leadership team as he is a seasoned operator with a proven track record, he is ideally suited to help us achieve further cost reductions and accelerate free cash flow generation. With Gary officially joining this week and the continued work of our existing team, we are confident that we will identify additional opportunities to operate more efficiently and further reduce cost to achieve our target of removing $800 million in cost from the business over the next five years.","As we identify and quantify these cost-cutting measures, we are committed to keeping you updated on progress as we go. Before Jimmi Sue provides additional detail on our strong first quarter financial results, I would first like to turn the call over to Gary to share his thoughts on the Company and what drew him to EQT. Gary?","Gary Gould","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm very glad to be here and to join you today as EQT's new Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Before I join the EQT team I most recently served as Senior Vice President of Production and Resource Development at Continental Resources. And earlier in my career I held various positions at Chesapeake, ConocoPhillips, Burlington Resources Resources and Exxon. These experiences taught me a lot about collaborative leadership, operational excellence and the efficient development of shale assets. And I'm very much looking forward to applying this knowledge here at EQT.","I'm glad to be back in Marcellus and I'm excited about our future. This company has a world-class acreage position in the heart of the play. And our contiguous footprint is well situated to become the lowest cost, most efficiently develop asset in the entire basin.","I'm pleased to partner with Rob and the rest of our management team here to drive further development, efficiencies and cost reductions. And I believe we will generate significant free cash flow for many years to come.","Also, I look forward to getting on the road to meet with shareholders in the next weeks and months ahead to discuss the future of our company. And I want to thank everyone here at EQT for the warm welcome I received this week.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jimmi Sue.","Jimmi Sue Smith","Thanks, Gary, and good morning. To echo some of Rob's earlier comments, I will begin by highlighting that our continued efforts to improve operations are materializing in our financial results. In the past two quarters EQT has generated approximately $306 million in free cash flow. Our shift to steady state operations, combined with our concerted effort to improve efficiencies resulted in first quarter capital expenditures that were in line with our expectations, which is down 22% with more feet of pay turned in line compared to first quarter of 2018.","We expect to hit our full-year capital expenditure guidance of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. We're excited by this progress and reiterate our adjusted free cash flow guidance of $300 million to $400 million for the full year based on strip pricing as of March 31, as well as our expected $2.9 billion of cumulative adjusted free cash flow through 2023. With successful implementation of our Target 10% initiative, our five year cumulative adjusted free cash flow is still expected to be $3.4 billion.","Now I'd like to provide a little more insight into our 2019 expectations. To reflect our first quarter volumes of 383 Bcfe, which was above our guidance range, we have increased our full-year volume range by 10 Bcfe to 1,480 Bcfe to 1,520 Bcfe. We expect our second quarter volumes to be between 355 Bcfe and 375 Bcfe with modest sequential increases in the third and fourth quarter.","On our last earnings call, I highlighted the cadence of our adjusted free cash flow for the year. In which I guided adjusted free cash flow range of negative $50 million to negative $100 million for both the second and the third quarter. While we continue to guide this range, we expect that adjusted free cash flow will be slightly better than the midpoint for both quarters.","With respect to the cadence of our capital expenditures for the remainder of the year, we expect the second and third quarters will be slightly higher than the first quarter on increased activity during the summer months, especially for our construction crews. Our fourth quarter capital expenditures will be lower, closer to $400 million, reflecting full realization of our cost savings and lower activity as we reduce to our steady state with one fewer drilling rig.","Regarding our detailed guidance, per unit cash expenses may fluctuate each quarter alongside volume, but the full-year guidance is in line with previous expectations. Focusing on the quarter results, EQT reported first quarter 2019 adjusted net income of $212 million or $0.83 per share, compared to $179 million or $0.67 per share in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $171 million, up 92% year-over-year.","As noted in our press release and in accordance with SEC rules, this number is not adjusted for an $8 million litigation reserve and $4 million of proxy related expenses in the quarter, which would have made free cash flow $183 million for the quarter.","Sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs were up approximately $45 million from the first quarter of 2018, primarily on increased sales volume. However, this improvement was offset by a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2019. Our net marketing service revenues were also down as a result of fewer releases of contractual capacity not used to transport our gas and as a result of the divestitures in 2018. This line item is generally not expected to be significant in 2019.","Per unit cash operating expenses decreased by 5% primarily due to increased sales volume. In addition, on a per unit basis, LOE was lower and gathering expense was higher compared to the first quarter of 2018, as a result of the divestitures last year.","As I mentioned at year-end, not only were the divested assets expensive to operate, but the divested volumes did not incur gathering charges because our production group operated the gathering assets and included those costs in LOE.","We did realize personnel cost savings in SG&A as a result of our cost saving initiatives and reduction in force during the first quarter. However, this reduction was offset by a benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2018 related to forfeited incentive compensation awards. Excluding the $8 million litigation reserve recorded in the first quarter of 2019, SG&A would have been flat on a per unit basis compared to the first quarter of 2018.","Before moving to our standard liquidity update, I would like to make a few comments about first quarter pricing dynamics. Our average realized price was lower for the first quarter at $3.16 per Mcfe, compared to $3.33 in the first quarter of 2018. This was primarily due to a lower differential and a decrease in higher price liquid sales as a result of the divestitures in 2018.","Our average differential was down $0.12 compared to the first quarter of 2018 on lowered gas daily pricing during the quarter. In 2018, as during most winters, cold weather resulted in higher gas daily pricing versus the first of the month, especially in the Northeastern United States. We leave a portion of our portfolio open to capture these peaks, which did not materialize in 2019. The lower gas daily pricing also resulted in a lower average differential compared to our guidance for the quarter. As we noted in our release this morning, we still anticipate full year average differential will be a negative $0.45 to a negative $0.25 per Mcfe.","Moving to EQT's cash flow and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with $350 million drawn on our $2.5 billion revolver and $41 million in cash, which is a reduction in net debt of just under $500 million from year-end. At this level, our net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA leverage is just under 2.1 times and when reduced for the value of our investment in Equitrans Midstream is 1.6 times. We continue to target leverage of 1.5 to 2 times and still expect to use proceeds from a future divestiture of our Equitrans stake to reduce leverage.","With that, I will pass the call back to Rob.","Rob McNally","Thank you, Jimmi Sue. Before we open the call up for Q&A, I'd like to reiterate that our strong first quarter results reflect our focus on enhanced operational efficiency. I'm extremely proud of the hard work and dedication displayed throughout the entire organization. Not only do we have a world-class asset base, but we also have a world-class group of employees. With the oversight of an active and engaged Board, we have developed a comprehensive and thoughtful roadmap to maximizing free cash flow, not only in 2019, but for many years to come.","We've successfully reshaped our culture to focus on capital efficiency per share returns through accountability, collaboration and transparency, driving stronger results for our shareholders. Our strong financial and operational performance is just the beginning. And we're excited that our renewed operational focus will deliver significant value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you as we continue to deliver results throughout the rest of 2019.","So at this point, we'll open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Good morning, Robin and team. I wanted to first start off with your thoughts on how some of the operational improvements that you've outlined are impacting? How you're thinking about D&C costs on a per lateral foot basis, I believe if I'm not mistaken, that your guidance was based on, call it 900 to 915 per lateral foot for this year and how are you seeing things today?","Rob McNally","Hi, Arun. Yes. So I would say that the results that we've seen both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2019 are all really positive. Right. I mean, so they will shade us a bit lower on our cost per unit, whether Mcf or per foot. I'm really pleased with the efficiencies that we've seen with drilling, with completions and rollouts, we're making real progress in all fronts. So it's early in the process and our guidance has remained pretty consistent for the rest of the year, but if I had to bias it, I would say that cost would shade further down and not up.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. Second question is, you talked a lot about, at least in the press release the -- some of the success on the lateral -- on pushing lateral lengths. Could you comment, Rob, on what you're seeing on the well productivity front as you're pushing lateral lengths...","Rob McNally","Yes. So, all of the data that we've collected thus far suggests that there is no degradation in productivity with longer laterals, that we're still getting effective fracs way, we do have to make some adjustments on staged lengths, so that we can keep the rate high enough. But everything that we've seen so far suggest that there is no degradation of productivity based on lateral length. So pleased with the well productivity results.","Arun Jayaram","Final question, Gary, for you, obviously, you had a lot of success thinking about being at Continental, a low-cost operator. What is -- some of your thoughts just early on and some of the benefits that you think you could bring to the table as you think about the operating plan on a go-forward basis?","Gary Gould","Sure. I've been fortunate to be on a lot of really strong teams and had a lot of good results. I think what first attracted me to EQT was the strong oil and gas asset position that we have here. We have several years of inventory in the core of the Marcellus. And with that in hand, I think the future looks great. The second thing that impressed me here was, earlier in the year when I met with the Executive Management team, I found them to be just very smart, very energetic and very collaborative in their approach to leadership. And that matches up with my style also. I also found the team to be very focused on maximizing long-term shareholder value, and that's exactly how I approach operations.","And then lastly, I would add that, this week as I continue to meet with my management team and some of the staff, I have found them to also be very smart, very collaborative in their teamwork and with a strong initiative to get operational results. I think that, if you look at my background, whether it be at Continental Resources or Chesapeake or some of the companies before that, we've always run our operations with the bottom line in mind of maximizing shareholder value and we've been successful in doing that in a multitude of plays, whether it be oil plays or gas plays and I look forward to leading operations here to continue to generate operational efficiencies and maximize shareholder value.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Hey. I just wanted to hit the point on some of the efficiencies in the lateral cost per foot there you think you kind of highlighted earlier. I know in your most updated detailed 29 capital plan that you had in your deck. Did you stay at a little higher cost for D&C CapEx for the PA Marcellus? And your tills and spuds are going down, but the budget stays the same. So could you help me kind of square the circle around that?","Rob McNally","Yes, sure. There is a few more moving pieces here. The first thing I'd say is that, the changes in schedule really are a good thing from a capital efficiency point of view. So the tills and lateral drills -- sorry, the spuds and lateral drilled are going down because we were able to drop a couple of rigs earlier than we expected. We had more rigs under contract than what we really needed for this plan that we're just going to build DUC inventory, but we were able to lay down rigs quicker than we thought. So that was a positive.","The next piece is, where it had been more efficient in our frac operations. So we're getting more stages per day done than what we budgeted. And therefore, we're going to frac about 10 or 11 additional wells in 2019 above what was planned using the same number of frac crews. So we'll spend a bit more money there, which largely offsets the reduction in drilling. And that sets us up very well for 2020, because as we come into 2020 we're going to end up -- we are going to till -- I believe it's going to be seven less well than planned in 2019, but those wells will be ready to till early 2020 and require very little capital to get them online. So, overall, the scheduling changes are reflection of getting the steady state a bit quicker than we thought we would and more efficiencies, particularly on the frac side.","Scott Hanold","Okay. And you are seeing cost per lateral foot then. And I know there's -- some of the calculations are difficult to get your arms around because of the changes here. But you are seeing that trending down or fairly consistent with your prior outlook, I guess, when you shake everything out?","Rob McNally","Yes. I mean, all the efficiencies, both drilling and on the frac side those translate into lower cost per Mcfe. So the cost per unit is trending down.","Scott Hanold","Okay. And then, with that shift in activity, did that have an impact on your liquids expectations for the year. I think the liquids expectation came down a little bit for the full year?","Rob McNally","That's not related to scheduling, that's more around Mariner East East as well as the high unit that isn't going to be in service as soon. I think, it got delayed two quarters, I believe. So that's the reason that we have seen ethane volumes come down.","Scott Hanold","Okay, alright. And then finally, so what is your rig count right now. So would -- how many rigs are you able to drop? Would you able to go through from and to with these efficiencies?","Rob McNally","We started the year running 10 rigs and we were planning to get down to seven and then six throughout the year. We just got there faster. We are down at seven rigs right now, seven horizontal rigs. And originally we were intending to be there sometime in the third quarter. So we were able to sublet three of the rigs.","Operator","The next question comes from Gene Transco of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Gene Transco","I will try to ask a question on Mountain Valley Pipeline. Maybe you can give us an update in terms of construction and regulatory process? And if we still should be thinking about the project as 1Q '20 event?","Rob McNally","Yes. Hi, Jane. That's really a better question for the Equitrans management team. I believe that they are reporting next week. And so, we really see what is public information. And so far Equitrans has maintained a year end 2019 in-service date, and that's still what we have baked into our plans.","And from our point of view, we think that this pipe is one that is highly likely to get built, the risks really is more around timing. But from an EQT perspective, if there is a delay, which we certainly don't know that there will be, but if there is, it actually is not incremental to us, it actually is a little bit helpful for 2020 cash flows, because the spreads on that transportation right now are a bit under water. But we do -- I want to be clear that we really do want to see MVP get built, and as a significant shareholder in Equitrans, we still hold our 19.9% stake. It's very important that, that pipe get done, and it's important for the industries takeaway capacity and our own takeaway capacity as we move forward in time that MVP get built.","Gene Transco","Okay, got it. I have a clarification question about changes in the operational plan for 2019. 2020 -- So 2020 numbers did not change, CapEx remained unchanged, then production outlook remained unchanged. So I was just thinking how this changes in 2019 operational plan are going to translate in some sort, maybe lower CapEx or high exit rates for '19?","Rob McNally","Right. That's a good question. And I would point out that we have not updated the five year plan, we've updated the 2019 guidance, but we have not updated the five year plan. When we do, what you will see is, there will be capital efficiency improvements in 2020 and beyond that are not yet reflected in that five year plan. And as we have gained efficiency both on the drilling and the completion side, that will flow through and we'll really start to see the benefits of that in 2020. And a good example is the additional 10 wells that we're going to frac in 2019 that only marginally affect 2019 volumes, will take effect in 2020 and there will be limited capital that has to be spent on those 10 wells in 2020.","Gene Transco","Okay, got it. And if I may, the last question. I would just like to understand the role of Ohio Utica in your asset portfolio and maybe West Virginia and Marcellus as well. I just see that the number of wells drilled there is considerably less than, let's say, in the core acreage. What's the future outlook for the production in Ohio Utica, West Virginia and Marcellus?","Rob McNally","Yes. So, as you rightly point out, we're drilling fewer wells in West Virginia and Ohio than we do in Pennsylvania, which really is the core for us. In Ohio, that Ohio Utica, it -- economically it matches up reasonably well versus the Marcellus. It's not quite as good as core Greene County and Washington County, Marcellus, but it is reasonably good. And it's a nice blocky position where we're able to drill long laterals and it is a little bit different in terms of pipes that we can touch with it. So it does give us some diversification of operations that we like.","In West Virginia, it is more difficult to operate, the land -- the rules and laws around land pooling, et cetera, are more difficult, it's harder to put together long laterals. But it is high quality rock and it has more liquids content. So economically it does compete reasonably well with Pennsylvania, Marcellus. Again, not quite as good as core Greene County and Washington County where we're drilling 12,000 to 14,000 foot laterals. But there is a place in the portfolio for both West Virginia and for Ohio. And as we make -- we make progress on the land position in West Virginia, you'll see us trying to deploy more capital in West Virginia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Holly Stewart of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Holly Stewart","Maybe just an extension on Scott's question. Rob, you mentioned that you guys were ahead of budget on stages per day. Can you just give us kind of what you're doing on that front? And then what you had budgeted for?","Rob McNally","Sure. It's really around -- it's largely around the logistics on the path. So this is being thoughtful about pad layouts, how we get sand and water trucks in and out in a most efficient manner, it's manifold design changes on offloading water, it's measuring KPIs on time to unload, waiting times. So it's just paying attention to all the small details around logistics on the pad and making sure that the frac crews have the water and the sand that they need, when they need it. And it's just kind of optimization of what is a fairly complex logistics problems and we've made real strides on that front by paying attention to the variables that really matter.","Holly Stewart","Okay. And maybe just kind of continuing on the sort of cost savings slide deck. I think, that goes through a lot of reason. And particularly as it relates to water, I know you guys in ETRN have talked a lot about sort of optimization of the gathering system. Can you just make any comments on maybe where that process stands? What that could do with your water needs there? And then how that sort of plays into this longer term well cost reduction?","Rob McNally","Yes. So at this point, we haven't -- there's not much, physically that's changed in terms of how we manage water, other than we're doing a much better job optimizing how we move water with trucks. Ultimately, the real win is to move as much water as possible in pipes, as opposed to trucking it, including impaired water. So we are in discussions with Equitrans on a number of fronts, one of which is, how to better manage water logistics in an area where we have a real concentration of activity.","So that really points you to Greene and Washington Counties in Pennsylvania. There is opportunity to start to move some of our impaired water or maybe even a majority of our impaired water via pipe as opposed to trucks. And that's a significant difference. Right. And when you -- today we move about 75,000 barrels of impaired water a day, about half of that is in our core Green and Washington County areas. If we can pipe the water, we think that it's going to save us something like $5 a barrel in water cost.","And so, when you do the math on that, it's valuable. And this isn't going to happen overnight, it's going to require some infrastructure, but it's something that's in the works. And I think that it is -- it's very doable. I think the other advantage is from our safety and environmental perspective, it is much more desirable to pipe the water as opposed to trucking. Water hauling is one of the most dangerous parts of this business and the fewer trucks that we have on the road the better. We will never get to zero, but as much as we can minimize it, it is an economic safety and an environmental advantage.","Holly Stewart","Perfect. And then maybe one last one if I could, any update around your plans for the June maturity?","Jimmi Sue Smith","Sure. Holly, this is Jimmi Sue. We've said all along that we had -- we intend to sell down the ETRN stake and reduce debt. But we've also said that, that sell down is going to take a year to two years, although I would be surprised if we're still holding it two years from now. So with that and the June maturities coming up, we have plenty of room on the revolver. Remember, it's $2.5 billion to cover those maturities. And so, I would expect to see those taken out with the revolver or something cheaper than the revolver.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Following up on a couple of the earlier questions on the efficiencies that you're seeing translating into free cash flow, you use the phrase capital efficiency improvement a lot. I just kind of wanted to know you down a little. Is the conclusion that the combination of efficiencies that you're seeing, as well as the scheduling and cadence changes will lead to otherwise a greater free cash flow in 2020 and greater free cash flow over the five year -- over the five year program, is that a upside bias, but not necessarily to 2019?","Rob McNally","I think what you said is correct. They would bias us toward better, all else remaining equal, better free cash flow in 2020 and beyond.","Brian Singer","And then my follow-up is for Gary. As you enter and coming back to the Marcellus after having worked actively looking at the oil shales more recently. Do you see more of an opportunity for EQT on the productivity improvement front or the cost efficiency front? And to what degree do you see opportunity to put expertise and apply them from the oil shale plays and apply them to the market?","Gary Gould","Yes. So, this is Gary Gould, and I've been here about three days now and I think it's my fourth day. So it's probably a little early to comment on that. But what I would tell you is that, we will certainly be looking at all of that. We will absolutely be looking at cost, on CapEx, on LOE as far as optimizing costs and generating these operational efficiencies that we've talked about. But we will certainly be looking at the production side also to look at the combination of production and costs for designs associated with completions and designs associated with our production capacity in order to make sure that we are maximizing shareholder value, not just reducing cost, but maximizing shareholder value and therefore optimizing when it comes to production.","And as we look at that, we will be continuing to compare our own performance to ourselves quarter-over-quarter and continuing to look for improvement. I think you already see great results from the first quarter here at EQT and then we will also compare ourselves to others within the basin to make sure that we become the lowest cost producer.","Operator","The next question comes from Sameer Panjwani of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please go ahead.","Sameer Panjwani","Circling back to the midstream side of things for a second, I think previously you've mentioned being optimistic that the constraints could be addressed by the end of this year or early 2020. I'm trying to understand how much lead time is needed to execute on that timeframe in terms of trying to triangulate when an announcement regarding the ongoing negotiations that's need to be made?","Rob McNally","Right. So there is work that's ongoing. And what we have said and what is baked into our plan is that, the midstream constraints are resolved by the end of 2020. Now we do think that we can make progress prior to that, and in fact even in the first quarter we saw throughput on one of our major systems above what we thought we could do. And so we are making some progress with tweaking the Midstream system.","The greater and having -- the greater high pressure, low pressure system will take a bit longer to do, because there are permitting issues that have to be resolved, there is engineering that has to be done and there's some pipe that has to be put in the ground. But we're confident that, that can happen and that work is ongoing and it is well related to the other negotiations with Equitrans, we are not waiting on those to be completed before we -- before we keep that work moving. So we're optimistic about how we fared versus our plan that we will be at least on time or maybe early on that plan. And we'll continue to update you as we make progress.","Sameer Panjwani","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the A&D side of things. We've definitely seen the market start to thaw here a little bit. So wanted to get your updated thoughts and your willingness or ability to maybe prune some of your non-core Marcellus acreage? And also just to get an update on the leasing side of things, what the going rate for kind of leasing in your core areas today?","Rob McNally","Yes. So on the A&D side, our willingness to divest non-core assets. Certainly, we are hoping that we're always open to discussions around value of assets and if it's more valuable to somebody else and they're willing to pay us worth and it's accretive to our shareholders and that's certainly something that we would consider.","I think that realistically there is not much of a market for Tier 2 Marcellus at this point, I think the economics just don't support it. But we're always open to having those discussions if there are people who are interested in either in Tier 2 Marcellus or even stuff that's further back, that's Tier 1 but further back in our drilling program.","On the leasing rates, I'd say that there's not a material change in what we're seeing in leasing. right. It's been fairly consistent. And it varies a bit area by area, but I don't think there's been any major change.","Sameer Panjwani","Okay, great. And then finally to the extent you're able to provide some commentary on the litigation announcement this morning. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts or the Board's rationale around the voting process.","Rob McNally","Yes. So the board is reviewing the Rice nominees, we're preparing our proxy materials, it's all kind of in the normal course of how this process needs to run. And the decisions will get made on the appropriate time line. And we're not going to get pushed to it faster than what the Board is ready to do. And frankly, this is kind of much to do about nothing. And it feels a bit like an attempt to just distract attention from what was really a great operational quarter and real progress for the Company. So that's really where we want to keep our focus.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","Just curious, if you could maybe comment back on the -- just kind of the operational efficiency front. It seems like you're building up a handful of DUC here over the course of the year. How you think about the optimal level of kind of an operational DUC backlog versus the current activity profile? And how would that DUC backlog compare to what you expect to expect to exit the year at as opposed to like -- kind of normal operational backlog might look like? And then, I guess, do any of these changes in efficiency change -- what optimal rig and frac crew counts look like in that five year outlook and that will do for me.","Rob McNally","Sure. Thanks Michael. In terms of the DUC count, it actually going to come down a little bit as we work through the year, it was going to rise some prior to us being able to farm out the three rigs that we talked about earlier. In terms of an optimal DUC count, I'm not sure that really is one, right. We want to make sure that the wells are drilled and ready to be fracked so that we don't have a bottleneck in the process. And there's also some land considerations on holding acreage, so we sometimes need to drill wells and build DUC backlog from a land point of view, but I'm not sure that there's a magic number in terms of number of DUCs. We just want to make sure that the operation is running smoothly and there are bottlenecks in it.","Michael Hall","Okay. And has the view on the needed level of rig count and frac crew counts for the five year outlook change at all with the improvements in efficiency or is that not yet material enough, I guess, to fully change that for the long data view?","Rob McNally","We're only a quarter into this and while we have seen some efficiency gains better than what we -- than what we had planned on. I think we need to let this run forward a little more before we change rig and frac count counts. I think right now we're running seven rigs and five -- actually six frac crews. That neighborhood is going to be the right one in this commodity price environment and maybe if the efficiencies really hold or continued to improve it means it will drop another rig and one more frac crew, but I think this is probably the right neighborhood to think about.","Michael Hall","Okay. And maybe just one follow-up on that. Are you guys seeing any just raw pricing improvements from the services side, as you guys are working with your partners on that end or any movement on that front?","Rob McNally","There's been a little bit of improvement in pricing, but it's single digit, it's not a big number. What I would say though is, our efficiency in working with our frac crews and with our frac providers has gotten much better. Right. We have changed the culture a bit where we are really trying to be good partners with our service providers making longer term commitments and really working hand-in-hand to improve the efficiency of the operations.","That's where we've seen the big gains. I mean, we've gone -- as far as saying you guys tell us what we're doing to slow down the operations and how we're causing problems and we've changed a number of our procedures and processes in that partnership and that has -- we've seen real improvements. So I'm extremely excited about that. I think that's been a big move in the right direction. And it really is much bigger and more important than any pricing changes is the efficiency gains.","Operator","The next question is from Betty Jiang of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Betty Jiang","Maybe a follow-up to, Rob, what you just said earlier. Considering your free cash flow target guidance for this year is based on, I think, around 290 gas price, which is higher than where strip is today. Do you basically see the efficiency gains to date capable of offsetting the impact of lower prices, just based on strip pricing? And then, like weather in a lower price environment is the goal to maintain free cash flow in lieu of activity and production?","Rob McNally","Yes. So, I'd say there's a few competing points here, Betty. Certainly, pricing coming off has a negative impact to free cash flow, but the efficiency gains that we have made do offset that partially. And I would also say that, we've been fairly aggressive in hedging the back part of the year. And so we protected ourselves from the recent -- from at least a portion of the recent price moves. So we still stand by our guidance of $300 million to $400 million of free cash flow in 2019.","Betty Jiang","And then, you alluded to earlier about negotiations with Equitrans. Considering the midstream cost really make up a substantial part of the cash cost structure. What type of measures is possible to potentially push those costs lower?","Rob McNally","Yes. I think that there's a broad -- there's potential for a broad renegotiation with Equitrans over our midstream contracts. Gathering transmission, it includes water. There is a number of areas where we can help Equitrans grow their revenue base with us by providing other services or other areas where they don't currently do the gathering. Water is a great example of a new revenue stream that they could generate.","And then for us Equitrans can help lower our per unit gathering rates. And you're right, that is a big portion of our costs. And so when you think about where we are with G&A and LOE, we're at pretty low levels, but there is big numbers in the gathering and transportation costs where I think we can make real progress with Equitrans. And have it truly be a win-win deal for Equitrans and EQT where Equitrans has the ability to grow their revenue base and we have the ability to lower our per unit costs.","Betty Jiang","Great. I'm going to throw it out there, but in terms of what type of magnitude could we -- are we talking about here?","Rob McNally","Well, when you think about LOE or SG&A, you're talking about pennies or portions of pennies, right, per Mcfe. When you're looking at $1.20 plus of gathering and transportation costs, maybe you're talking about nickels or dimes. And so there is potential for significant improvement that we can't find in other parts of the cost structure.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Rob McNally for closing remarks.","Rob McNally","Okay. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate the time this morning. I look forward to updating you in the second quarter. And as always, if you have follow-on questions please feel free to contact Blake. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Patrick Kane, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Thank you. You may begin.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Christine. Good morning everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's conference call. With me today are Dave Porges, Chief Executive Officer; Steve Schlotterbeck, President of EQT and President of Exploration and Production; Randy Crawford, Senior Vice President of EQT and President of Midstream and Commercial; and Robert McNally, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","This call will be replayed for a seven-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 PM Eastern Time today. The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415. The confirmation code is 13637697. The call will also be replayed for seven days on our website. To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call, if you're interested, is 201-689-7817.","In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's third quarter 2016 results, Dave will discuss his retirement announcement, and finally, Steve will give a brief operational update. Following the prepared remarks, Dave, Steve, Randy, Rob will all be available to answer your questions.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob McNally.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Pat. Before reviewing third quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions. As a reminder on May 6, we completed an approximately $800 million common stock offering. At the time, a portion of the proceeds were used to fund the approximately $412 million Statoil acquisition with remaining proceeds to be used for another acquisition of similar size.","On Tuesday, we announced the acquisition of approximately 60,000 net Marcellus acres, which also includes 39,300 net Utica acres for $683 million. These acquisitions are consistent with the equity raised and will be paid for using those proceeds plus the proceeds from the latest dropdown to EQM.","The signing of the recently announced acquisitions, combined with the Statoil acquisition and a few smaller deals and leasing activity during the year, bring year-to-date committed investment in undeveloped acreage to approximately $1.2 billion and represent the most Marcellus under contract for acquisition by a single producer this year. These investments are consistent with our consolidation strategy and create value through purchasing undeveloped acreage while minimizing the amount paid for flowing production, which tends to be value neutral.","This year alone, for every 1 acre developed, 19 acres have been acquired. Our core Marcellus acreage has increased by 143,000 net acres or 55%. And our undeveloped location inventory has increased to almost 3,700 locations. Much of this acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing development area. Therefore, the lateral lengths of 190 existing EQT locations can now be extended from approximately 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet on average. At a flat $2.50 realized gas price, the IRRs on these wells increased from approximately 9% to 37%.","Effective October 1, EQT completed the final drop of Midstream assets to EQT Midstream Partners for $275 million. The drop included the Allegheny Valley Connector, a transmission and storage system, along with several Marcellus gathering systems. The sale did not include a small gathering system that is currently being evaluated for potential sale, which would bring total proceeds above $300 million.","As a reminder, the Huron gathering system will be folded into EQT Production and Midstream results will solely reflect the results of EQT Midstream Partners, which will still be consolidated into EQT Corporation's results.","I'll now give a brief overview of the quarter. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced third quarter 2016 adjusted loss of $0.26 per diluted share, which represents a $0.06 per share decline from adjusted EPS in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased by $19.3 million to $167.7 million for the quarter.","EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results. EQT recorded $78.1 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the third quarter of 2016. We currently forecast $320 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the full year of 2016, assuming the midpoint of EQM's guidance.","The operational story for the third quarter was strong volume growth in a low commodity price environment. We had another very solid operational quarter, including record produced natural gas sales and record volumes at Midstream. The third quarter was very straightforward so I will keep my remarks fairly brief.","EQT Production continued to grow sales of produced natural gas. Production sales volume of 196 Bcfe, which included 3.5 Bcfe from the Statoil acquisition in the recently completed quarter, was 26% higher than the third quarter of 2015. The lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. The average realized price at EQT Production was $2.20 per Mcfe compared to $2.55 in the third quarter of last year. You'll find the detailed components of the price differences in the table in this morning's press release.","Net marketing service revenues totaled $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, which is relatively flat for the same period last year. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $524.6 million or $49.7 million higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A, gathering, transmission and processing expenses were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth, although production taxes and exploration expenses were lower for the quarter.","Moving on to the Midstream results in the third quarter, operating income was $132.7 million, up 17% over the third quarter of 2015. Operating revenue was $214.3 million, $15.8 million higher than the third quarter of 2015 as a result of higher Marcellus volumes. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $81.6 million, $4 million lower over the same period last year. On a per unit basis, gathering and compression expenses were down 17% as a result of higher volumes.","And finally, our standard liquidity update. We closed the quarter in great shape with zero short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes cash on hand at EQM or EQGP. Pro forma for the acquisitions that I mentioned earlier and for the funds received from the drop to EQM, the cash balance would've been approximately $1.35 billion. We currently forecast approximately $750 million of operating cash flow for 2016 at EQT, which includes about $150 million of distributions from EQGP.","With that, I will turn the call over to Dave.","David L. Porges - EQT Corp.","Great. Thank you, Rob. I only have about one topic in my remarks. I was going to talk about the Cubs but Pat Kane discouraged me from doing so. So my only topic today pertains to my announcement of my intention to retire as CEO early next year and transition at that time to the role of Executive Chairman. It has been my honor to serve as an executive officer of EQT Corporation for nearly 19 years, including being CEO since early 2010.","When my tenure as CEO began, EQT was already a well-run, shareholder-value-focused company. However, it did seem appropriate to elevate the importance of our financial strategy for a period of time, and that was a central focus of my tenure. During these nearly seven years as CEO, we have created additional value via the creation of two new public entities, several transactions between EQT and those entities, sales of non-core assets and acquisitions of assets complementary to our core business.","We also raised sufficient capital to fund our value accretive growth and maintained a strong credit position through a very difficult time in our industry. Along the way, we made a variety of commitments to our investors and I believe that the recently announced Midstream drop in upstream acquisitions honor the commitments that we made. That said, while financial strategy will always be important, it no longer needs to have the outsized role it had during much of my time as CEO. In a sense, therefore, I believe that my work here is done.","On the personal side, as many of you are aware, I do have a variety of other interests so it's my family being first amongst them but various not-for-profit endeavors also being increasingly important to me. Even as we have achieved much of what I set out to accomplish as CEO, these other interests and priorities have exerted an increasing tug on my thoughts and energies as I look to make a difference in other ways. Putting that another way, as much as I have enjoyed the past 19 years and as proud as I am at what we have accomplished at EQT, there are other things that I want to do with my life that are tough to do when one is a full-time executive at a publicly traded company.","So, no matter which way one looks at it, this is a good time to hand over the reins. Steve Schlotterbeck is well-suited to be the Chief Executive Officer. His pairing of strong analytical skills with the nurturing of a culture of innovation are just what the company needs as it moves into its next phase of value creations. These recent value accretive acquisitions are a clear example of his leadership, as are the combination of operational focus and scientific and technological innovation that he has brought to our company-wide focus on creating shareholder value. I am confident he will do well and investors will do well with him at the helm.","Finally, I have actually enjoyed most of my interactions with investors and analysts. Thank you for your support and insights over the years. And with that, I will turn it over to Steve.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying what a great honor it's been to be chosen to succeed Dave as CEO of EQT Corporation, and I'm humbled to be entrusted with the responsibility to lead this great organization forward. EQT's future is bright, thanks to the transformative leadership of Dave Porges. His vision, financial acumen and leadership abilities have fundamentally changed EQT, positioning us at the forefront of energy development and keeping us well positioned to face future challenges and opportunities for years to come.","EQT has endured one of the industry's most challenging periods of cyclical uncertainty, primarily because of our stringent focus on costs, our strong balance sheet and our uniquely integrated business structure. The combination of our outstanding upstream and midstream assets, together with strong financial management and operational nimbleness, will enable us to continue creating and delivering value for EQT shareholders.","Maybe the most important reason I'm so confident in EQT's future is the strong and dedicated leadership of our board and executive team and the continued commitment of the most talented employees in the industry. This is an exciting time to be a part of this company and this industry and I'm excited to be a part of it.","Now let's continue with the review of our recent core Marcellus acreage acquisitions and our current thoughts on our Deep Utica program. Starting with our Marcellus acreage acquisitions, as Rob mentioned, we announced the acquisition of an additional 60,000 core Marcellus acres this week. Year-to-date, we've added 143,000 core acres, including 63,000 from Statoil and 20,000 through smaller and leasing efforts during the year.","More importantly is that since 2013, we've added 230,000 core Marcellus acres. We've completed 477 wells over this same time period, developing 44,000 acres. The net result is an increase in our core undeveloped acreage of 186,000 net acres or roughly 1,950 net incremental locations. We've heard some of the rumors recently about inventory constraints at EQT. Simply put, we are not inventory constrained. We will continue to fill in gaps and look at bolt-on acquisitions but with this week's acquisitions, we have achieved our near-term acreage acquisition goals.","Moving to the Deep Utica, we continue to make progress on our Deep Utica testing efforts. We are becoming more confident that we will achieve a combination of lower costs with higher EURs per foot that will result in similar, if not better, economics to our core Marcellus economics. As we mentioned last quarter, we've already lowered costs down nearly to our target range of $12 million to $13 million per well.","Based on our progress, we think that we'll reach our target range soon. We have also seen an improvement in productivity from changes we've made to our frac design on the last two wells. Given our well cost expectations, we think we need between 3 and 3.5 Bcf per 1,000 feet of pay to achieve returns which are competitive with our Marcellus opportunities. We're not there yet, but we aren't far off, and are certainly encouraged by our progress.","Our current thinking is that you should expect a one rig Deep Utica program in 2017 drilling between six and eight wells. We believe this level of drilling will allow us to achieve our cost and productivity objectives as well as begin delineation of the economic extent of the Deep Utica with the goal of establishing a Deep Utica development program in 2018.","As far as progress reports, we believe it's in our shareholders' best interest not to share specifics of our techniques or results as we are currently the only company investing in the Deep Utica. Before moving into development mode, we need to ensure that we can effectively move the gas, so we've been working closely with our Midstream group on gathering system designs. Based on pressures in the production profile of the Deep Utica, our initial estimate is that per unit gathering costs for Deep Utica would be about half that of the Marcellus.","In summary, we continue to make solid progress on both the cost and recovery efforts and we're encouraged that the Deep Utica can compete with or surpass our core Marcellus economics in the near future. I'll now hand the call over to Pat.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thank you, Steve. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Christine, could we please open the call up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen.","David L. Porges - EQT Corp.","Good morning.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Let me be the first, I guess, to give my shout out to Dave. Dave, very many accomplishments over, I mean, certainly my 12 years in covering this stock. I'm not sure another company has changed in so many ways, so a much deserved retirement.","David L. Porges - EQT Corp.","Thank you.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Maybe starting off, Steve, you were kind of running through that fast. Can you give me the \u2013 you said one rig may be dedicated next year. What was the amount of wells drilled?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Six to eight wells with that one rig.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, great. And then maybe just following up on the three acquisitions that we've talked about for 2016, I know there's some Midstream contracts that you're sort of working through on the Statoil deal, but can you maybe just talk to us about how you're thinking of development there? And maybe priorities in terms of those properties.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah, I think in terms of how we'll develop that, we'll incorporate that acreage into our land process and we will allocate capital based on the best returns available starting in our 2017 plan, which we'll talk about in December. But I will say one of the main drivers behind all these acquisitions is our desire to extend laterals. And part of that then requires us to go re-permit a lot of the existing locations to take advantage of those synergies.","So there is a bit of a delay before we get immediate benefits from the acquisition, so it'll probably be mid-2017 before a significant portion of our development program is incorporating the new acreage. But we don't want to drill short laterals when we can take a few months and go back and re-permit and get the better economics. So you will start to see benefits from the acquisitions next year, but it'll probably be the back half of the year before we really get full speed ahead.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just one last one for me. It looks like this is the first time that you guys have stripped out the ethane volumes. Maybe just a little color here, has there been a shift in strategy on extracting ethane? Or how should we be thinking about that?","Randall L. Crawford - EQT Corp.","Hey, good morning, Holly. This is Randy. As I've said in the past with respect to ethane, we are opportunistic in extracting ethane and, to the extent that the opportunity presents itself that we can extract the ethane and sell it above the methane pricing, we're taking that opportunity and we have 10,000 barrels a day of capacity that will allow us that. So we broke that out to demonstrate that.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, so don't necessarily think about this as sort of a go forward. It's sort of a one-off quarterly opportunity.","Randall L. Crawford - EQT Corp.","Well, no. It's basically on market conditions so as we extract the higher Btu gas, to the extent that it's in EQT's best interest to extract the ethane and sell it into the capacity, we'll do that. Otherwise, we'll sell it for methane prices and the market has, with the improvement in ethane recently, it's been a core part of our business to go ahead and extract the ethane to increase value to the shareholder.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Holly, I would just add that this capacity, the 10,000 barrel capacity Randy mentioned, came on in the second quarter.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Perfect, thank you. Understood. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And, Dave, congrats on your retirement and, Steve, congratulations on your new role here. The press release referenced the transition towards more operational drivers from financial drivers. I'm wanting to see if perhaps in that context, Steve could discuss perspective on the importance of integration and, Steve, how you view leverage versus liquidity versus outspending cash flow at the E&P and midstream level.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yes, I guess first on the integration. At the current time, we think we generate significant benefits from the ability to work \u2013 the two businesses working together. I think we do have a view that over the long term, the benefits received from that versus the benefits of separation might be outweighed by separation. But I think certainly in the short term, we continue to think that the combination of the two businesses makes the most sense for our shareholders.","The second question around leverage and liquidity and outspend, I think as you've seen through this downturn, we appreciate the value of a strong balance sheet. We've historically \u2013 I think it's really a legacy from our utility days but we've been a investment grade-rated company. I think we continued to view that as valuable. So I think you'll see continued focus on keeping our balance sheet strong.","I think we have a number of levers available to us to fund an outspend if we think that's the prudent path forward, particularly our large stake in EQGP is available to us to sell down to fund an outspend. But I would say, generally speaking, to grow at competitive rates does typically require a bit of an outspend. So I would think that's likely in the future but all depends on what we think the economics of our opportunities are. So I think I'll leave it at that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great and very helpful. My second question's also somewhat strategic. You know, a year ago, maybe eight months ago we get a lot of questions on the potential for EQT to expand in Appalachia and you've done a couple of acquisitions that you've referred to here. And I wondered whether you think you're at the asset in size and scope that you think is reasonable going forward or whether we should expect Statoil continue to be active in considering further consolidation opportunities in the basin and, if so, what that market looks like?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, I think there's two ways to answer that. I guess first, as it pertains to size and scope, I think we feel very comfortable where we're at. We have a very deep inventory and the ability to grow at competitive rates for quite some time. So I think we're not going to be driven by a desire just to gain scale.","That said, one of the biggest value-creating opportunities we see in Appalachia is the efficiencies we get from drilling longer laterals. So the acquisitions we've done to date are designed to allow us to drill longer laterals and get those efficiencies and drive the unit cost down. And to the extent that opportunities become available that fit our acreage well and allow us to gain those synergies, I think we'll continue to be interested. Subject to the comments I just made about liquidity and balance sheet strength, we're not going to stick our neck out to do that but if there are opportunities to continue to put large blocks of acreage together that allow us to drill longer laterals, then we would be interested in taking a look.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, gentlemen, and congratulations to you both. I wanted to start off perhaps, Steve, in talking about the acquisitions, obviously, it appears that one of the drivers was just increasing the ability to drill longer laterals, and we did note that this quarter your laterals were, at least on the Marcellus side, were pushing close to 9,000 feet. But from a geological basis, can you talk about the quality of this acreage relative to your current core in terms of gas in place, thoughts on potential EURs and how does this acreage that you've added in this deal, plus the Statoil deal, compare to what you have previously?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Oh, I think, yeah, we're very happy with the quality of the acreage in all three of these deals. Specifically, Statoil and Trans Energy are West Virginia-focused or all in West Virginia focused, or all in West Virginia. All very connected to the acreage we already have in Wetzel and Marion counties and Tyler County, and we think very consistent with the results we've seen down there, specifically because I think I'd seen a question or two about Marion County. I think there's been less drilling there and some of the competitor results may be a little bit less than a little bit further to the west.","I can tell you we turned in line six wells in Marion County in April of this year, and all six are exceeding our type curve for northern West Virginia. So I don't know if that's a result of the acreage we have, and the Trans Energy acreage is directly connected to the acreage where those wells were, or if it's different completion techniques or exactly why, but as a result, we're very encouraged by that portion of Marion County, which I would imagine is probably where, if you were going to speculate on the acreage, that would be where the concerns might be. From the data we have, we're very excited about it.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just from a lease expiration standpoint, could these deals cause you to maybe run faster a little bit just to make sure that you lock up the acreage? Or how does that influence your plans in 2017 and 2018?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, I think in 2017 and 2018, it'll have very little influence. The vast majority of the acreage we got that's not held by production doesn't have expirations until 2019 and beyond, which is one reason we like these. So very little near term expirations. And I would say if it does affect our development plan it won't probably, that factor won't drive the pace. It might drive how we select locations. So we might have a preference for pads that hold acreage versus pads that are already held. I think the pace will driven more by economics and our liquidity position.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. If I could sneak in one more. Just on the Utica program, it sounds like the last two wells that you've completed have maybe improved your bias or your thoughts around the Deep Utica. I think ceramics, we're seeing maybe in the previous calls, may be an enabler. But can you just talk a little bit about what's changed or the improving well productivity, but maybe a little bit about what's improved in terms of the overall Deep Utica program versus a prior call or two?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. As I said, we don't want to give out any specifics on what we're doing since right now I think we're the only company, perhaps one other is investing a little bit into Deep Utica. But the one factor we have talked about in the past that I'll comment on is the type of proppant. We started with ceramics. We had a view that maybe sand would work and at the time would be significantly cheaper than ceramics. We switched over. Those next couple wells were significant underperformers from the Scotts Run. And then we switched back to ceramics for the last couple wells and they were significantly better than the wells with sand. Those two wells have gotten us much closer to the target recoveries that we think we need.","So I think ceramic, it does play a big role. Our current plan is to use ceramics for all wells in the future. And fortunately, we've also been able to cut the cost of the ceramics basically in half from the first well. So that also helped on the economic side. Beyond that, I will say we have been doing a lot of technical work on our drilling completion techniques, the typical stuff you would think about, types of sand, loading schedules, pump rates, targeting in the reservoir, all that kind of stuff. And I think as we drill wells and learn more, just as we saw in the Marcellus, we're seeing continuous improvement.","That's one of the reasons we want to spend the next year basically doing one well at a time so we can try new techniques, learn from them, apply them to the next well and not get too far over our skis. But we do think with another six or eight wells, we'll be in a position where I'm confident we'll have the costs where they need to be. I'm pretty confident that the recoveries will get into that range that we think we need. And hopefully, we'll also have a chance to delineate the extent of the economic area of the Utica.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, think Scott (sic) [Steve].","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Guffey with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys, and thanks and I'll echo my congratulations. I'm just curious, other operators in West Virginia have been touting productivity gains from completion optimizations and have you even discussed elevated type curves? And I guess just wondering if you can talk about how your West Virginia Marcellus completions are evolving and should we expect to see a change in the average per foot productivity or an increase in the type curves across that core area, and if any of these gains could influence your 2017 guidance?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, yes and no. One thing I'll say is we recently adopted a new standard frac design that uses considerably more proppant per foot based on some very early tests and a lot of reservoir modeling. We do expect this new technique to yield a higher MPV per acre and per well. We probably won't increase our type curve until we have sufficient production history from a number of wells to confirm the results. And we just started that in a broader way two or three months ago. So it'll take quite a few more months before we have wells online with production history. So if it plays out the way we expect, we would expect an increase in the type curve, but I don't think that's going to happen in the next couple of quarters.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Is that just in West Virginia, or are you seeing anything in Southwest PA as well?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","That's actually in both areas. Across our whole core position, we're adopting a technique with more sand.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And then it looks like firm transportation volumes are obviously increasing to the Midwest, and it looks like that's going to continue to grow throughout most of 2017. Just curious what types of increase in transportation should we expect to see into 2017?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","I'm sorry, you're talking about how much transportation additional capacity that we have?","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Correct, yeah. It looks like the additional volume is moving into the Midwest.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. With the completion of the OVC, we now have additional access, as you know. So we'll be moving up to about 650 million a day over the next few months and, depending on the market conditions, could move even more going forward.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Should we expect to see a per unit increase in transportation expenses moving forward as those volumes increase?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Those volumes and those capacity commitments are fixed in nature so essentially, you'll see that. But net in terms of realized prices, we should see an increase in our realized price. In fact, from an EQT perspective, we're taking action to ensure we're building the pipelines to get higher realized price. So yes, the transportation costs per unit but net realized prices should be increasing, obviously.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And then one last one on efficiencies. I see you guys are running three top hole rigs and three Marcellus rigs. Just wondering if you can discuss any efficiency gains made over the last year? And then currently, how many wells per year can a single horizontal rig drill with a top hole rig running out of it?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","I guess, first, on the efficiencies, just a couple stats. Year-to-date 2016 versus 2015 actual data, on a dollar per thousand foot of pay, we've seen about an 18% improvement. So from a little over $1,100 per foot to a little over $900 per foot in 2016. Our current thinking is we're starting to put together a business plan for 2017 is that we should expect to see a further reduction in that cost or further improvement in efficiencies. A lot of that will be driven by longer laterals that we expect to be able to drill in 2017. And on the number of wells per rig top set, I actually don't have that number. I would guess it's probably 20. If we top set them we can drill 20 wells with the big rig per year.","Daniel Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for all the color, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning guys and congrats. Say, just one sort of general question here. You know, obviously now when you look at that core sort of rectangle to you guys, always break out when you include now all this additional great acreage you picked up. How much variation do you see in returns? I mean, you have a pretty big swath there, all the way from Allegheny down to Doddridge. And I'm just wondering, kind of in broad terms if you assume somewhat similar D&C techniques? How much do you anticipate the returns that are in there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Neal, we actually see very little variability in the bulk of that rectangle. One little exception, potentially is once you get north of Pittsburgh, you'll see the rectangle goes up there into Southern Butler County and Armstrong County. Those returns are not quite as high and we're not really focused drilling up there. But there is consolidation opportunities potentially with long enough laterals they can be competitive. But with that exception, the returns are pretty equivalent. We get a little of the liquids benefit in the majority of West Virginia that we don't get in Pennsylvania, and that tends to offset a small productivity advantage that Greene County, Pennsylvania has.","Neal D.

Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.","Philip P. Conti - Director, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Pat, and good morning everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.01, which represents a $0.60 per share decrease from adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT also decreased by $202.3 million to $80.7 million for the quarter. Results in the quarter were significantly negatively impacted by lower commodity prices, which I will address in a minute. There were two fairly significant non-cash items that partially offset each other in the adjusted earnings this quarter. First, we recorded non-cash losses on hedges of $25.9 million during the quarter. The second item was a positive $35.7 million benefit based on IRS guidance on the regulatory ratemaking treatment of a like kind exchange associated with the utility sale, which had the effect of favorably distorting the reported effective tax rate for the second quarter.","This tax benefit will reverse either over the life of the assets or upon a taxable disposition such as a future dropdown. Excluding this tax benefit, our year-to-date effective tax rate was 10.5%, which is still abnormally low due to an increase in our earnings attributable to the non-controlling unitholders of EQM and EQGP, which are not tax affected as well as negative production operating income as a result of lower commodity prices.","As Pat mentioned, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corps result. And EQT recorded $58.2 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interests or $0.38 per diluted share in the second quarter 2015. Other than that, the second quarter was fairly straightforward and I will keep my remarks rather brief.","Starting with EQT Production, the story here continues to be growth in sales of produced natural gas, although that growth was overshadowed this period by lower commodity prices. Production sales volume in the recently completed quarter was 34% higher than the second quarter 2014. Despite that volume growth, we recorded a $66.9 million operating loss in the quarter at production, including the non-cash losses on hedges of $25.9 million that I just mentioned and that compared to operating income of $113.7 million last year, excluding the $31 million gain on the asset exchange in the second quarter of 2014. So again, the significantly lower average realized price more than offset the volume growth. Operating revenues were $269.5 million excluding the non-cash loss, $113.5 million lower than last year's second quarter. The realized price at EQT production was $1.41 per Mcf equivalent, compared to $3 per Mcf equivalent last year. And you'll find detailed components of the price differences in the tables in this morning's release.","Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $310.5 million, or $50.7 million higher quarter-over-quarter. DD&A was $37.1 million higher. Transportation and processing expenses were about $11 million higher. And LOE, excluding production taxes, were about $3 million higher, all consistent with the volume growth. Exploration expense including $9.4 million of non-cash lease impairments was $4 million higher quarter-over-quarter.","Moving on to the Midstream business, operating income here was $108.2 million, up 22% over the second quarter of 2014. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission revenue. Gathering net operating revenues increased by 35% to $122.9 million as gathering volumes increased by 35%. Transmission net revenues increased 19% to $61.1 million, as additional firm capacity was added over the past year, mostly in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Storage, marketing and other net operating revenues were down $4.3 million in the quarter. Total operating expenses at Midstream were $81.2 million or $10.6 million higher as a result of our continuing growth. On a per unit basis, however, G&C expense was down 19% as a result of volumes growing faster than expenses.","Just a brief note on liquidity; EQT had about $2 billion in cash on hand at quarter end, excluding the cash on hand at EQM and EQGP as well as full availability under EQT's $1.5 billion credit facility. So we do remain in a great liquidity position to accomplish our goals for the foreseeable future. Our current estimate of 2015 EQT operating cash flow is still $900 million, adjusted to exclude the non-controlling interest portion of EQM and EQGP's cash flow.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Schlotterbeck.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Thank you, Phil. Today I'll give you an update on the two topics of interest to investors over the past few months, upstream M&A and our deep Utica well. On the upstream M&A front, we've not seen many deals getting done. It seems that sellers have not changed their value expectations to reflect a natural gas strip that is significantly lower than a year ago. We continue to believe that there is significant value creation opportunity by consolidating core Marcellus positions into larger more contiguous blocks. This would not only add to our core Marcellus development inventory, but more importantly, it would increase the economic value of our existing leasehold by taking advantage of the significant economies of scale of larger multi-well pads and longer laterals.","We also believe that attractive M&A opportunities may present themselves as the effects of the low price environment become more pronounced for companies that entered this cycle with insufficient liquidity. However, we will be patient to ensure that any M&A activity we pursue will create additional value for our shareholders.","Moving on to our dry gas Utica well. Last week we successfully completed the fracking of this well. The frac was an 18 stage job in a 3,221 foot lateral that utilized ceramic proppant. We were able to successfully place 100% of the planned proppant while maintaining our desired pumping rates.","Last night we concluded a 24 hour deliverability test to sales of this well. During this test, the well averaged 72.9 million cubic feet per day with an average flowing casing pressure of 8,641 psi. This equates to a 24 hour IP per 1,000 foot of lateral of 22.6 million cubic feet per day. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported IP of any Utica well to-date and the per-foot rate is more than double the previous high. As you might expect, we're very pleased with the results of this well.","I want to make note of the fact that we were able to flow this well directly into the sales pipeline without shutting in production from our other wells. This was possible primarily because of the integrated nature of our Upstream and Midstream businesses.","Our Midstream group was able to reconfigure the gathering system to allow this capacity to be available, which likely would not have been possible on a third-party system. Our current plan is to produce this well to choke controlled rate of approximately 24 million cubic feet per day to manage the stress on the proppant and to monitor the pressure decline so we can begin to get an understanding of the decline profile and EUR potential of this well.","Currently the well is producing 26 million cubic feet per day and approximately 2,000 barrels of frac water per day with flowing casing pressure of 9,555 psi. In fact, the flowing pressure is currently climbing as the well continues to clean up.","In addition, we plan to spud another deep Utica test in Wetzel County, West Virginia, in the third quarter of this year. Following that test, we will evaluate our next steps, where we expect to quickly begin focusing on lowering the cost of drilling and completing these wells. Our current estimate is that wells in this area can be drilled at a total cost of approximately $12.5 million for a 5,400 foot lateral, but it will take us several more wells to get fully up the learning curve.","Finally, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all the EQT folks involved in this success. As you've heard me say before, this well was the most technically challenging well we've ever drilled and completed. Our outstanding team was up to the challenge and has delivered a truly phenomenal well while continuing to maintain a safe and environmentally responsible operation.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave Porges for his comments.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve. I'm going to mainly discuss topics related to EQGP. But before doing so, want to convey my congratulations to Steve and his team for the recently completed Utica well. They provided me with daily updates that focused on the issues that we're created by the tremendous reservoir pressures we encountered, but also made clear their excitement about the possibilities and clearly that excitement was more than justified. Great job.","Now, on to EQT GP Holdings LP, or EQGP, which completed its initial public offering of 26.5 million units priced at $27 per unit in mid-May. To remind you of our motivation to take the GP public, we were seeking more midstream value transparency for EQT investors. EQT Corporation owns 90% of EQGP, a value of about $7.6 billion or about $50 per EQT share. This is a pre-tax value and the tax basis is low.","Assuming a 15% cash tax obligation, our stake in EQGP is worth about $6.5 billion. We also still have about $800 million of midstream assets that have yet to be dropped for a total midstream value of $7.3 million. EQT's market cap is $11.1 billion that was based on last night's close, implying a value of EQT production of $3.8 billion. Using consensus 2016 cash flow estimates of $995 million, EQT production is being valued at less than four times cash flow, less than half the multiple of our Marcellus peers. So either we are not getting full value on our stock for our Midstream business or our Production business, or a combination of both. We will focus on our IR effort toward highlighting the value of our company and still anticipate that the transparency provided from a publicly traded GP should start showing up in EQT's stock price.","While the valuation discount creates tension, we think having the two businesses together continues to create significant value for both Midstream and Production, as evidenced by the relative outperformance of EQT and EQM stocks. The MLP has provided a significant source of capital to fund development of our Marcellus and Utica acreage. Those volumes are flowing through the Midstream pipes, generating earnings growth at Midstream.","Furthermore, matching the deductions generated from the capital investments at Production minimizes the cash tax hit from the dropdowns of Midstream assets to EQM. More important strategically is that the combined companies also make projects such as the Ohio Valley Connector and the Mountain Valley Pipeline more viable. This is because the Midstream starts with a significant anchor shipper in the form of EQT Production, and EQT Production gets optimally located pipeline projects. However, we recognize that over time, as EQT Production's growth rate slows and EQM's third-party growth accelerates, the synergies of having the two units together is reduced and the uplift in market value of a separation could exceed the value creation from the synergies.","We are frequently asked about the tax consequences of monetizing our EQGP stake. So I will summarize the tax impact of a few scenarios we get asked about. In the event of future sales of EQGP units by EQT, up to about $1 billion per year, we would be able to use our current year drilling deductions to offset the gain on the sale of units. We would still expect to incur alternative minimum tax obligation of between 10% and 15%. Given our cash balance and planned plan dropdown in the first half of next year, it is unlikely that we would need to access this source of capital for some time, but did want to respond to inquiries about that hypothetical situation.","Given the strong M&A market in the Midstream space, we also get asked what would happen in a hypothetical situation in which we sell the entire EQGP stake. As you likely inferred from my comments on ratable sales, a sale of the entire stake would result in a large gain that would overwhelm our drilling deductions. In that case, the proceeds and excess of the available deductions would be subject to a tax greater than 15%, but well less than the 35% federal tax rate because of carry backs. This would be the worst case from a tax leakage perspective, though the premium that would be required to make that a viable scenario would offset some or even most of the tax leakage.","Clearly in that scenario, we would look for a more tax efficient transaction and would also need to find a way to get that value to EQT shareholders rather than just leave that much cash on the balance sheet.","Finally, a tax efficient separation of Midstream from Production is an alternative. If done properly, a separation would not trigger a tax obligation and to answer questions we have received on that scenario, we continue to do a lot of work to ensure that we would not inadvertently endanger a tax efficient separation. So my purpose in this discussion of EQGP was to discuss value transparency and also answer questions related to tax issues. The Utica results also point toward the need to consider Midstream implications of a potential further shift of the North American natural gas supply mix toward the core Marcellus Utica play.","As Steve alluded to, coordination between Upstream and Midstream is even more important, if these large Utica wells become a norm. In addition, even, or perhaps especially in a low price environment, an environment largely created by Marcellus Utica productivity, the organic opportunity for Midstream investment in this region grows. We will continue to focus on gathering and header projects with EQM's announcement this morning of another large investment for Range Resources being the latest example.","We will also continue to look for the occasional complementary takeaway project, such as OVC and MVP. We are not convinced that these growth prospects are fully reflected in the unit prices of EQM or EQGP, yet the growth prospects for both EQM and EQGP look even greater in the wake of our enormous Utica well and the great results our neighbors have also been getting in their early Utica wells.","The Utica is not exactly a positive for longer term natural gas prices, but it is very much a positive for those of us with core Utica positions and those of us with Midstream assets in this region. We will sort through these Midstream implications in the coming months and share our thoughts with you in future calls.","In conclusion, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by intelligently accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We have a very strong balance sheet which will allow us to continue to be focused on doing what we can to increase the value of your shares. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat Kane.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","Thank you, Dave. This concludes the comments portion of the call. Kyle, can we please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Philip Jungwirth from BMO.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. Can you expand upon the reduction in the 2015 capital budget by $100 million? Is that all E&P that can be attributed to incremental cost deflation because it looks like you spent roughly 60% of the $1.7 billion budget which would imply a second half quarterly run rate of $350 million or so? Or if you're lowering that budget to $1.6 billion, a run rate of about $300 million per quarter.","Philip P. Conti - Director, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, Phil about $25 million to $30 million of that is the E&P, because the \u2013 some, not all the well cost will see the reduction for the full year. The rest is our Midstream projects that are basically slipping into next year on the gathering side.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. And then with the success in the Utica, I mean, EQT is still spending quite a bit of money in the Upper Devonian, which you guys show as a lower return zone. I think 22% of the spuds this year are going to the Upper Devonian. Is there a nat gas price where you would rethink that co-development with the Marcellus? And then also, how would that compete for capital given the success in Utica?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Phil, This is Steve. I think we've already reassessed our Upper Devonian areas based on the lower gas prices, so we'll continue to do that. There are certain areas at the current prices that make sense. And I think relative to the Utica, while this is clearly a phenomenal well, we need to get up the learning curve and get our cost down and get some decline history of this well, so we truly understand what the economics are. I would say the initial data far exceeds our expectation. So I think that's a very positive sign for the economics of the Utica, but we're going to need to drill a few more wells and understand the type curve a lot better before we make any major shifts to our development plan.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. And then, my last question, you highlighted the implied some of the parts multiple for the MP business being roughly half what the publicly traded pure play comps are trading at. In your view what would you attribute this discount to more? Is that the market view that peers have higher returns, greater inventory depth or is it simply a conglomerate discount that won't be unlocked unless there's a full split of the Upstream from Midstream?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On my basic view, this is Dave, I'll let Pat answer too though, an inadequate investor relations effort.","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","I would agree with that.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But Pat, do you \u2013 I haven't actually studied why that would be so I'm happy to...","Patrick J. Kane - Chief Investor Relations Officer","It's very hard to know. If you start with the Midstream value, the Upstream looks cheap. If you start with an Upstream value then the Midstream looks cheap. So it seems to be the conglomerate issue.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. Steve, that, obviously dry gas Utica well came out at a pretty robust rate and it sounds like you guys are trying to manage it around 26 million cubic feet a day and I know it's really early. But based on what you've seen from some of the other wells and what you all know from this one, I guess in the short timeframe that you've had it online, what is your expectation in terms of that mid-20 million cubic feet a day rate? How long could that stay flat and implications on when an EUR, just an early-day EUR could look like?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","I think, Scott, we literally finished the deliverability test last night and the results were quite a bit in excess of our expectation, so I think it's a little premature for us to be predicting EURs and even the length of time at the current rate. We're going to need to study it a little while before we have any reasonable sense of that, but I think given the 24 hours we've seen, it's a very strong well and the pressures seem to be holding up very well. So, in fact it's still cleaning up, so like I mentioned in my comments, the pressure's actually still inclining a bit as the water production declines. So it hasn't even really fully cleaned up yet for us to get a good clean data set. So I think you're going to have to wait a little while for those kinds of predictions.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Can I ask a question on what \u2013 when you look at some of the other dry gas Utica wells that have been drilled and what had been your general expectation? You said it exceeded expectation, but what was your sense of what EURs can be based on the dozen or so wells that have been drilled with some history in the basin?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Well, again, I don't know that I want to comment on EURs of competitors' wells. I think you can refer to what they thought. What I will say is, we had set up to flow this well at 60 million cubic feet a day and to be honest I thought that was a bit insane. I didn't expect that from this short lateral. We had some extra units out there in case of mechanical problems and once we saw what this well was capable of, those backups became primary units. So that we could go above the 60 million cubic feet a day and frankly we were struggling to hold this well back at those rates.","So it definitely was \u2013 we were expecting a good result, setting up for 60 million cubic feet a day and then the see these rates with even higher pressures than we expected, which means lower drawdown, so we didn't have to pull on this well very hard at all to get those rates. That makes us have to go back and reassess what's better about this, what's better about the reservoir than we expected. Do we have the right gas in place numbers or is there more gas in place. So it's premature really to comment on any of that given less than two days of production data on one well.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","In the Wetzel County well that you all will be drilling, what is the relative depth to that compared to what this one was at? Is it (26:30)","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","It's similar.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","It's a similar depth.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","It's similar. It's in that 13,000 foot to 14,000 foot range.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay. And I guess my next line of questioning is, you had a lot of frac stages I guess that weren't online at the end of this quarter. Could you give us a general discussion on why that number was so high at the end of the quarter and what we should expect in the coming I guess quarter or two?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Sure. Same answer I give every call. That's completely driven by timing of multi-well pads and long laterals with lots of stages. What I will tell you that I really haven't provided on future calls is we expect an increase as the year goes on in number of stages we're turning in line per quarter with the fourth quarter of this year being the highest for the year, which will drive production results in early 2016, but it's strictly driven by the timing of rig moves on big pads.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And just so I understand that right, so like if there was a multi-well pad there, you're going to complete a certain amount of those wells, but that pad may not be timed correctly to get it online by the end of the quarter, but it would be, for example, in early July, and so those would come online a little bit later.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Exactly. Yeah.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Understood. Thanks a lot guys.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","You bet.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Holly Stuart from Howard Weil.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Morning.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","So, Dave, I appreciate the comments on the valuation discrepancy. It sounds like as you get Pat working harder, this discrepancy will erode over time.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","He said it was the sell side that had to step up, just so you know.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","You guys have certainly not been ones to sit on your hands. So I guess I'll leave that discussion there. Maybe bigger picture on 2016 thoughts, maybe just kind of thinking similar commodity levels, commodity price levels, how does your activity change maybe from this year to next year?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll have to take a look at that in the normal course of events. We do try to be influenced more, given the lags of the wells, by the longer-term strip, something that will match when the gas is actually getting sold. And of course one of the things that's going on in the basin right now is that supply is outstripping for the time being takeaway capacity. But a number of projects, our projects, I mean EQM projects as well as other midstream companies' projects are coming online over the course of the next couple of years. And that at least will help with that. But clearly we will have to relook at activity level and where we allocate resources.","As Steve mentioned, it's very early with the Utica to figure out what the implications are, but if we keep getting these kinds of results and our peers keep getting these kinds of results, then I do think we have to assume that that's going to shift the supply demand balance again, which will mean that some places probably don't make sense to develop. It will probably mean that the Marcellus Utica though, in future would make up an even higher percentage of the overall mix and we'd have to take that into account, the overall country. The North America's supply mix and we'll have to take that into account also. So clearly, we have to be working all of that in ahead of coming up with a budget for 2016.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Perfect. And then maybe Dave, just one other kind of bigger picture question on the cash. I look back through notes from, I guess, the end of the year and you kind of said financial stress makes you want to keep more cash on the balance sheet and come out stronger on the other side. Assuming things haven't changed in that line of thinking, but any color there would be helpful.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's exactly right. Still, wearing the fired retardant pants so that it doesn't burn a hole in our pockets. But, look, as Steve mentioned, if there's opportunities, especially on the Upstream side to enhance our current acreage position, then that's great. We want to be prepared to take advantage of that. But this is one of those times where I'm, geez, after the last three months, I think just for the whole sector we'd probably say no one would feel bad about having the liquidity position that we've got. And if anything, I think we feel better about it and I'm guessing we will get fewer questions about what we're going to do with all that cash because of this environment. That it just means that we're able to make decisions that we think are the right economic decisions for our shareholders rather than being overly influenced by near-term liquidity matters.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Yep. Perfect. And then just maybe one final minutia question. On the NGL realizations, I'm assuming no change to the barrel there. We're still rejecting ethane?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Yes.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, yeah.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, for years, our view, or at least my view has been getting heat value for ethane is, on a netback basis, not a bad deal versus the alternative. And I got to tell you, nothing's happened in 2015 that would have changed my mind on that.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Yep. Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to come at I guess the Utica question on maybe a little bit different way as it relates to competitiveness within the inventory. What sort of EUR level, given a $12.5 million development cost, would compete with the Marcellus in your thinking?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Again, I'm going to pass on answering that question because it's not just \u2013 it's not based on EURs, it's based on the decline profile of the well and with 24 hours of data, we just don't know. So, it's going to take some time.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Fair enough. Worth a shot. I guess somewhat similar to some of the questions I think that have been asked. But I don't think it's been asked. Are you all curtailing any material amounts of production? You have a lot of wells come on in the quarter, but gas production was relatively flat. Just appears you're curtaining much in the way...","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No operational issues, but...","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah, nothing, nothing in beyond that is just a normal day-to-day operations that's, that's likely due to the fact and a lot of those stages came on late in the quarter and just didn't have time to contribute.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah, that would make sense for the third quarter guidance. Okay, and then, I guess, the netback to EQT production after working through the fixed, more fixed type Midstream costs has fallen quite a bit quarter-on-quarter and obviously year-on-year even more so. How sensitive is the second half program to prices given the fixed cost nature of some of the cost structure?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There was a second half of the program isn't really sensitive to near term spot prices.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We always, again, evaluate based on what the strip is going to be, because there's nothing we will do in the second half that would result in revenues in 2015. Really at this point probably there's nothing we do going forward that's going to result in much in the way of revenues before the second half of 2016, just because of the lags involved. So that's really more what we follow, is what's happening. And we do recognize the strip has declined. But the other issues on the seasonality with basis has been probably a bigger deal and that's going to be \u2013 so we do time some of these activities to when takeaway projects are going to be coming online.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah, I guess that's what I was getting at, was more the strip level and if the strip falls more materially...","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you could always, absolutely always re-access what the economics look like, absolutely.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And then as I think about the G&P, the EQT Midstream cost as well as the G&P to third parties, how should we, just from a high level modeling standpoint, think about those on a per-unit basis, call it over the next 18 months? Are there any general pressures one way or the other that we ought to keep in mind?","Philip P. Conti - Director, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, they're pretty \u2013 been pretty steady. They move a little bit, Michael. Later today we'll put out updated guidance for the rest of 2015 and you'll see that the second quarter numbers are consistent with that.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Sounds great. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Say, great well. Say, Steve, I'm just wondering on the 400, I think on the slide it shows that 400,000 potential dry gas Utica acres. What's your thought as far as fully delineating that or will you just sort of stick to this, call it \u2013 I don't want to call a core yet, because you don't really know yet where the core is, but we stick to a concentrated area.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah, I think our plan will be to drill the Wetzel County, West Virginia well later this year, and that, we believe both our current well and that well geologically should be very similar, so we think that. And we think between those two wells and the acreage that they will delineate, we will have delineated plenty given what these wells will produce. And then we'll likely, rather than focus on delineating the extent of the play, we'll be focused more on cost reductions and efficiencies on the drilling and completion side and probably let our competitors do a little more of defining the limits of the play. So I think you'll see most of our drilling concentrated in that southwestern PA, northern West Virginia corridor where we think we have some really excellent Utica rock.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Steve, with just the two wells (37:54) on the slide deck, I think in your last update you mentioned maybe about five or so dry Utica wells this year. The plan just for the two this year now?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. I think there's a chance we will spud a third late in the year. We'll have to see on timing. I think our plan is since \u2013 the real economic key at this point appears to not be the reservoir. It appears to be the cost to drill and complete. So we don't want to go too fast so that we have the opportunity to learn lessons from each well we drill. So for the meantime, we'll probably be drilling one well sequentially rather than doubling up rigs and so that we can get full benefit from what we learn on each well. So a well in the third quarter depending on timing of that we may \u2013 around the end of the year would probably be another well. Maybe it'll be late this year or early next year. And then depending on how we progress up that learning curve and what the economics look like and the decline curves look like, that's when we'll know when it's time to accelerate or really what the plan is.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","It was just first one, or just this latest one. I shouldn't say first, was 100% ceramic used on it?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Well, we used some 100 mesh sand in the first part of each stage, but for all of the large size proppant, was 100% ceramic.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then you think you'll be able to, on the same pad, do Marcellus and Utica? And maybe probably too early to ask about stacked laterals, but just will you be able to put them on the same pad do you think?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. That's our intent. Yeah, this well is on a existing Marcellus pad.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then just last overall question maybe for Dave, just ,now you continue to have this massive Midstream obviously value that you were talking about there. Does that encourage you to maybe increase the speed at which you do some dropdowns or really that doesn't change your thought process today about how quickly you continue to drop some of the those things down? Again, you certainly have a phenomenally large position and even now with EQM with the news out this morning, new pipe there, are lot of things going on over there as well, just your thoughts on the size and maybe the speed of the dropdowns.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think we've kind of moved a little bit past where it's mainly a dropdown story. I see EQM as being more of an organic growth story and I agree with you, the agreement to build out that system for that \u2013 pretty sizable system for Range Resources is a good example of that. And that is happening all at the EQM level. We haven't updated our guidance or even our thought process yet about whether we've got one more or a couple of more drops and we've alluded to how much value, cash flow, et cetera we have remaining at EQT and we do continue to invest a little bit at the EQT level in some of that.","But generally speaking, you should be thinking about this as being organic growth at EQM and incidentally, I'll volunteer that, from an economics perspective, since we are into the high splits, it winds up being most value accretive all the way around to focus on organic projects, rather than, say, acquisitions or things like that. And that includes with the dropdown. So we will drop what remains, but the focus at EQM is to create value through pursuing these organic opportunities and again, that's, as you're seeing, we're going to \u2013 we're trying to grow our market share. That's what that Range Resources deal shows, to provide services to other producers. And I think the Utica's going to open up even more opportunities for EQM.","Neal D. Dingmann - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's \u2013 I'd agree with you. Thanks guys.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Sameer Uplenchwar with GMP Securities.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","Good morning, gentlemen. My question relates to service costs and operating efficiencies. Since the start of 2015, you've already seen like 16%. That's what I think Pat said on the call, 16% deflation in cost and that is, I'm guessing, is both high grading of the fleet and labor, and also drilling core acreage. I'm just trying to figure out on a long-term basis, how much of this do you think is sustainable where you can hold onto some of these lower costs and hold onto the labor and the fleets.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Well, I think actually that 16% is driven strictly by renegotiated service contracts, so there's no drilling efficiencies or any other factors in that 16%. Any of those factors would be over and above that. I think the reality of service cost reductions is they're not very sticky. If gas prices ramp back up, which I'm not expecting any time soon, but if they would, I think we'd likely be faced with service cost increases. So they tend to move with gas prices and operating levels.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","Got it. Thanks. And on the cash side of the equation, I know you have answered all the questions pretty well. What I'm trying to understand is, you want to hold onto that cash as a dry powder safety net, but how long do you want to do that? At what point in time do you decide that we could do a buyback, we could do a dividend growth or something along those lines if the bid-ask spreads continues to remain wide?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We continue to \u2013 we reassess that I'd say periodically. So that'll also factor in with drop schedules and the capital budget and things like that as we look later in the year. So the next time we take a real serious look at that, and this is really kind of starting now, is that they'll run up to the capital budget, the annual plan and capital budget for the coming year. So that'll cause a pretty deep dive on some of those things.","Sameer Uplenchwar - GMP Securities LP","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could give us a little more color on the Utica well cost for that first well.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah, Drew. It was \u2013 we don't have the final numbers yet, but it's going to be right around $30 million and if you recall we had some pretty significant issues dealing with the extremely high reservoir pressure. So it was pretty expensive.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. So you cited this $12.5 million target. What are the primary cost items that you're trying to reduce? Is this just rig time, with the rig outside or completion time? Anything else that's a big component?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","A lot of all of that. So the rig time was long, the completion time was long. There's lots of opportunity for improvement, which is why there's such a big gap between the cost of this first well and what we think these should be able to be drilled for. So like anything new, there's a learning curve. I think we'll be able to get up it pretty quick. Just I would expect our next well would be substantially less expensive than this first well. But it's probably going to take several wells for us to approach that $12.5 million number.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then you said you probably will split another two or three wells this year? Did I have that right?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","No. One more I'd say for sure and the possibility of a third very late in the year. It might hit this year, might hit next year.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Would you think we'd have results from that Wetzel County well this year?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Oh, no. I doubt it.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You doubt it? Okay. And then so the plan for drilling in 2016 is really predicated on results from your next couple wells. Is that fair?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Yeah, probably as much predicated on how this current well performs. So we'll be watching it for the next few months. That'll start to give us a first read on decline rates in EURs. At this point, all we really know is the productivity of the well, or the deliverability, which again was exceptionally high, but we need to see how it holds up to really understand the economics and what this really means.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","But it's a good place to start.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, that was a very impressive well. And then I was thinking about the spending plan for next year. I know it's too early for guidance probably (46:47), but have you guys run some sensitivities on what kind of spending you think would be reasonable if the strip proves to be about right for next year, or any (46:56) you could throw out?","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We actually look at that as we get into the autumn. So this is the time of the year we're probably least likely to do that type of back of the envelope sensitivity, because we're into the normal run up to our typical process and we will \u2013 you'll be doing that in some depth as we move into through third quarter into the beginning of the fourth quarter.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And Dave, as you mentioned potentially splitting, or at least hypothetically splitting the production segment for the Midstream segment. Is this something you're looking at doing in the near-term future? Because I think we probably hear a lot of the same frustration that your investors communicate to you, that they really see a lot of value in both pieces and they don't feel like it's fairly reflected in the stock price.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd just say that we are always focused and I think, over the course of the time that I've been here, this company has prided itself, and I think it's reasonably so, on being focused on creating shareholder value. So, I just leave it at that, that we just want to figure out the best way to create shareholder value over time.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough, Dave. Thank you.","David L. Porges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Daniel Guffey with Stifel.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. On your second Wetzel County, or on your first Wetzel County well, second Utica well, first was around 3,200 feet on the lateral. What's the length of your second well? And do you have an AFE on that yet?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","I don't know. Well, we don't have an AFE on it yet. I don't know the projected lateral length. I'm sure we will try to drill it longer than the 3,100 feet or 3,200 feet, but I don't know the exact length.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, you made a comment after drilling the Wetzel County well, you'll have plenty of acreage that's the de-risked. Care to throw an initial estimate on how much you think will be delineated after that second well?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","Well, maybe not that, but I will say that this first well gives us a high level of geologic and deliverability certainly around at least 50,000 acres. So there's 50,000 acres we think looks identical to this without getting too far away from this. We think Wetzel County looks similar, but that's getting pretty distant and is not included in that number. But that gives you sort of an estimate of, I'd say our certainty level has gone way up on at least 50,000 acres, just with this first well.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then final one from me, 16% decline in cost since year end and you gave some detail in terms of those potentially not being sticky, but I'm curious as we head into the second half this year, how much capacity do you think you have for further cost reductions?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - Executive VP, President-Exploration & Production","That's always hard to project. In April, I think when we announced our first set of cost reductions, we had gone through all of our suppliers and gotten what we thought we could at the time, but continued to work at it and now have announced another 5%. I don't know if there's another 5% or not, but I can tell you we're going to continue to keep working at it. So a lot depends on what happens in the market, what gas prices do, what activity levels do, but we're going to keep trying to squeeze a little bit more.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fantastic. Thanks for all the color, guys.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Pat Kane for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick J.

Kane - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Christine. Good morning everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's conference call. With me today are David Porges, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob McNally, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer; David Schlosser, Senior VP and President of Exploration and Production; Jerry Ashcroft, Senior VP and President of Midstream; Blue Jenkins, Chief Commercial Officer; and Nate Tetlow, Director of Investor Relations.","The replay for today's call will be available for a seven-day period beginning this evening. The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415 with the confirmation code of 13674484. The call will also be replayed for seven days on our website. To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, EQGP and Rice Midstream Partners are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there's a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. EQM and EQGP will have a joint earnings call at 11:30 today, which requires us to take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is 201-689-7817.","In a moment, Dave, Rob and David will present their prepared remarks. Following these remarks, Dave, Rob, David, Jerry, Blue and Nate will all be available to answer your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed EQM-RMP merger, EQM will file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC that will include a preliminary proxy statement\/prospectus regarding the proposed transaction.","The proxy statement\/prospectus, when filed, and other documents filed by EQT, EQGP, EQM and RMP with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. You should review materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction, including information about the parties and their respective directors, executive officers and employees that may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect to the proposed transaction and a description of the direct and indirect interest by security holdings or otherwise.","I'd also like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under risk factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are also on file with the SEC and available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations of the most comparable GAAP financial measures. I'd now like to turn the call over to Dave Porges.","David L. Porges - EQT Corp.","Great. Thank you, Pat. And I'm certainly happy that you were able to get through all those required disclosures before we have to end the call. The only topic that I would like to discuss today pertains to my new role as interim CEO.","Approximately one year ago, I retired as CEO and transitioned to the role of Executive Chairman. As you know, my replacement resigned in mid-March and I assumed the role of CEO to give the board a chance to decide upon a replacement. That search has begun and we expect to have a new CEO in place by the time of separation, which is still scheduled for the third quarter.","If you have any input you would like to provide, please let Pat Kane or me know. Just as I have committed to relay investor input about board composition and other governance matters to the full board, I also commit to you that I'll ensure that the whole board receives any input on this topic that you wish to provide.","Until our next CEO is hired, I will be spending most of my time overseeing the separation. We are fortunate that the upstream and midstream businesses have strong leaders. And as you can see in the first quarter results, the operations of both units are solid. The separation process is well underway.","At the board level, we are determining which board members will go with each company. As the board works towards completing that task, we are also evaluating each company's board composition to determine if we need to add members, and if so, what expertise those new people should have.","On the management side, we are identifying who would fill the various key roles at each company. And in a couple of cases, external searches have begun. We have also identified the nature of transition service agreements that might be needed to assure a smooth operational transition for both companies. As you can imagine, while we would prefer to not have any transition service agreements, we cannot allow the lack of certain personnel or fully functioning systems at one or the other entity to get in the way of separation timing, hence, the preparation of TSAs.","On the finance side, we announced the terms of the midstream streamlining transactions and have started to prepare the required SEC filings, which Rob will speak to in a minute. I am pleased that Rob and his team were able to craft agreements that appear to be value-accretive for all four entities. In my view, that was a noteworthy accomplishment.","In short, we are on schedule with all aspects of the separation. I thank you for your continued support as shareholders. And with that, I would turn the call over to Rob.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Before reviewing the first quarter results, I would like to give a brief update on several items that appeared in this morning's press releases. This morning, EQM, EQGP and RMP announced in a separate news release a streamlining transaction.","This transaction includes the sale of EQT's Ohio gathering assets acquired in the Rice Energy transaction to EQM for approximately $1.5 billion in cash and EQM common units. EQM will also purchase Gulfport Energy's 25% ownership in the Strike Force Gathering System for $175 million in cash.","Second, the merger of EQM and RMP in a unit-for-unit transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.3319, which implies a transaction value of about $2.4 billion, including approximately $325 million of assumed RMP debt.","And third, the sale of RMP's IDRs to EQGP for approximately $940 million in EQGP common units. The transactions are immediately accretive to both EQM and EQGP's distributable cash flow per unit. Relative to EQT, the cash proceeds from the sale of the Ohio gathering assets bring the E&P company's leverage closer to the target of 1.5% net debt to EBITDA.","EQM and EQGP have provided a forecast for 2020 and based on this forecast we expect NewCo cash flows of approximately $540 million in 2019 and approximately $670 million in 2020. During the same period, we expect cash taxes to be between 0 and 3% of these cash flows.","Regarding the announced separation, we're pleased with the progress that we've made and remain on track with our time line of a separation by September 30. EQM intends to file the S-4 related to the EQM-RMP merger in mid-May and we anticipate that the Form 10 for the separation will be filed in July.","Now moving on to the quarterly results, during the quarter we ran a process to sell our noncore Permian asset and this morning announced the sale of those assets for $64 million. Because of this divestiture, we are adjusting our full year production guidance to 1.52 Tcfe to 1.55 Tcfe.","Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $2.3 billion associated with noncore proved and unproved properties and related pipeline assets in the Huron and Permian Plays in the first quarter.","Adjusting for this impairment and other items, EQT announced adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.01 compared to $0.44 in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating cash attributable to EQT was $718.4 million for the quarter compared to $332.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners, EQT GP Holdings and Rice Midstream Partners are consolidated into EQT Corporation's results.","EQT recorded $141 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interest in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $86.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The $54.3 million increase was primarily a result of increased income at EQM and the inclusion of RMP and Strike Force Midstream LLC.","Now we move on to the segment results. Starting with EQT Production, first quarter production sales volumes of 357 Bcfe were 88% higher than the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the Rice merger and fell within the stated guidance range of 350 to 360 Bcfe. The average realized price, including cash-settled derivatives, was $3.33 per Mcfe, a 5% decrease compared to the first quarter of last year. Average differential for the quarter came in 85% better than the first quarter of 2017 but was below our guidance range of positive $0.15 to $0.25. When we gave differential guidance for the first quarter it was the coldest point in the winter and the forward curve was at its highest. The actual price settlements were lower resulting in a lower-than-forecasted average differential.","Operating revenues totaled $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2018, $520 million higher than the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased production associated with the Rice merger.","Total operating expenses excluding the $2.3 billion of asset impairments and $10.4 million of amortization were $903 million or 58% higher year-over-year. DD&A, gathering, transmission, processing and lease operating expenses were all higher year-over-year consistent with increases in production volumes due to the Rice merger. Importantly, cash operating cost per Mcfe were 26% lower than last year.","And moving on to Midstream results. EQM Gathering income for the first quarter was $99 million, $25 million higher than the first quarter of 2017. Operating revenues were $24 million higher than the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher contracted capacity and increased gathering volumes. Operating expenses for EQM Gathering were $27 million, $1.6 million lower than the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower SG&A costs.","EQM Transmission income for the first quarter was $79 million, $8 million higher than the first quarter of 2017. Operating revenues were $9 million higher than the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses for EQM Gathering were $27 million, $1.3 million higher than the first quarter of 2017. And briefly moving on to RMP Gathering and RMP Water. RMP Gathering reported an operating income of $44.1 million while RMP Water reported an operating income of $11.4 million.","To conclude, I'd like to discuss our cash flow and liquidity position. As of March 31, 2018, EQT had $1.3 billion of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the $2.5 billion credit facility. We closed the quarter with approximately $155 million of cash on the balance sheet excluding EQM, EQGP and RMP. We anticipate the drop will add approximately $1.2 billion of cash to EQT's balance sheet, further improving our liquidity position. We currently forecast $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion of adjusted operating cash flow for 2018 at EQT, which includes approximately $350 million to $400 million from EQT's interest in EQM, EQGP and RMP. With our forecasted adjusted operating cash flow and cash on hand, we expect to fully fund our forecasted 2018 capital expenditure plan of $2.4 billion.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David.","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Rob, and good morning everyone. Let me start by providing a quick update on 2018 sales volume. As Rob mentioned, Q1 volume was at the high end of guidance at 357 Bcfe. We still expect sequential quarterly growth for the remainder of the year and are guiding a moderate increase for Q2 at 360 to 370 Bcfe, followed by a larger increase in Q3 as new midstream infrastructure comes online in Pennsylvania this summer.","Moving on to operations. During the last year, our drilling engineering group has been developing an idea to manage our horizontal drilling operations in real-time from our offices at EQT Plaza, located in Downtown Pittsburgh. The thought behind this project was to improve collaboration amongst our technical teams, provide more consistent well results and improve our drilling efficiency. The team tested this idea in the second half of 2017, and we have now fully implemented the process.","All of our directional drilling, geosteering and drilling engineering is now done at our real-time operations center, or RTOC in Pittsburgh. Although in its early stages of implementation, this concept is already showing significant returns. Since implementing the RTOC, we have seen a 14% increase in lateral feet drilled per day, and we have increased our percent of formation drilled in target from 93% to 97%. We have also set EQT records for 48-hour footage drilled in a world record bottom hole assembly run. In addition, on April 12, we set a new record for the longest lateral drilled to date in the Marcellus on our Harvison H10 (15:44) well in Washington County, PA. This lateral will have a completed length of 18,670 feet and is scheduled for completion in May.","Based on the success of the RTOC for drilling, we have also implemented real-time centers for gas operations and water hauling and will pilot real-time centers for completions, construction and field logistics later this year. These real-time control centers are a great example of EQT's manufacturing operating model that we believe will result in efficiency gains and cost reductions by streamlining our processes.","And lastly, I want to provide a little color on well performance as it relates to these ultra-long laterals. Currently, our longest producing lateral is the Haywood H19 well located in Washington County, PA. This well has a completed lateral length of 17,400 feet and was fracked with 97 stages. The well has been online for 120 days, has produced over 4.6 Bcfe and is currently producing at our standard type curve of 2.4 Bcfe per 1,000 feet of lateral. Our expectation for this well is an ultimate recovery of close to 42 Bcfe. Based on drilling, completion and production results to date, our current estimate of the lateral length technical limit in the Marcellus is approximately 20,000 feet.","I will now turn the call over to Pat.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thank you, David. This completes the comments portion of the call. Christine, can you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Maybe I'll start with regards to the synergies that you'd announced with regards to the Rice transaction. So that's definitely noted on the G&A side, but maybe you could just run us through how that is progressing and the key milestones that you're looking for and we should be looking for over the next year.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Brian. This is Rob. So, on the G&A side, it's pretty straightforward. You can look at the G&A numbers that are reported, and what we had estimated prior to the merger was that the present value of the next 10 years worth of G&A savings would be worth $600 million. We now think we're going to exceed that number by maybe as much as $100 million. So that's gone well.","And as a proxy for the capital savings on drilling and completion, probably the best proxy is lateral lengths. And what we thought when we announced the transaction was that we could see lateral lengths improve from approximately 8,000 foot in Greene and Washington Counties to 12,000. Now our current estimates are that we'll be at 13,600 feet for 2018 and it will improve beyond that. And so we expect that we're going to exceed the $1.9 billion of capital PV synergies by a reasonable amount, several hundred million dollars. So I'd say that we're well on track to deliver and exceed those synergies.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is actually just two small questions. One related to the restructuring, which is the EQM shares that EQT would be taking on, what is the long-term view on the sustainability of keeping EQM as part of the EQT structure?","And then if I could just follow up on a comment you made with regards the 20,000-foot technical limit on lateral lengths in the Marcellus. Can you just refresh us on any ongoing acreage acquisition spending that you think you would need to be able to increase the number of those types of wells in the portfolio?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So as to your first question on the EQM shares, our plan is that we will take all of our midstream assets, EQM and EQGP units, and that will be under NewCo or SpinCo. And that's what will be spun out by September 30. And then at that point, EQT would no longer own any of the midstream interest.","In terms of the spending on acreage, the guidance that we've previously given still stands. We think that we're going to spend somewhere between $100 million and $200 million a year for fill-ins and blocking up acreage and protecting leases.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Just wondering if you could maybe just elaborate a little bit on the streamlining transactions that you've articulated this morning. Why did you choose this structure? And could this be step one of two? And I guess, my follow-up, is just thinking about at some point, are you contemplating a GP\/LP simplification down the road?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So, Arun, the next step is going to be the spin of NewCo, and when we spin NewCo, it will still have this structure. We'll have EQGP with EQM underneath and the IDR still in place. So the ultimate decision on what happens with the IDR simplification and it will be up to the NewCo board of directors and management team. I would give you my opinion that that structure is probably not viable long-term in this market and so I think it's something that we'll start putting our minds to. But again, I would emphasize that it's going to be a NewCo Board and management decision on the timing of any potential simplification.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect.","David L. Porges - EQT Corp.","This is Dave. Back to what Rob had to say, I completely agree. I think in Rob's earlier comments he's talked about a shelf life of IDRs, and that's going to be one of our first priorities with NewCo and the management team and board to see what that timing is.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, great. And just to follow-up. Just as you guys continue to push the technical limits of these lateral lengths, I was just wondering about as you think about the types of completions that you're using and how are you thinking about spacing between laterals, especially as you push on beyond 18,000 foot, does it change your spacing assumptions between wells?","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","This is David. I don't think going longer changes our spacing assumptions, but I just think, in general, we're leaning towards increasing spacing over time because that's where the technology is pointing. I think we're becoming more efficient with our fracturing technique, and we sort of know the boundaries of them. And I think over time you'll see our spacing probably increasing, which we think will ultimately result in lower development cost. So that's why we'd do it or development cost per Mcf. So that will be forefront on our thinking on that.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you just give us a little bit more color around that? Are you going from five wells per section to four or just a little bit of color around how that thinking is progressing.","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","I wish we had sections here, but we don't have them unfortunately. I would say that we are in the 750 to 800-foot spacing range right now. I think you'll see the industry and us going more in the 1,000-foot range over time.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Just hoping you can maybe just talk through any potential changes to timing of that pretty material free cash flow inflection and priorities of use of free cash flow post the spin?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yes. So I think that our prior guidance still stands. We expect it will have, with a low-teens growth rate we can generate $2.3 billion to $2.8 billion of free cash flow over the next five years. But just to maybe add a little clarity to that. If you think about our 2018 production level, the maintenance CapEx to keep production flat at this level, on average over the next five years, would cost about $1.2 billion. And so that leaves significant cash flow. I mean, when you think about EBITDA being in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, that leaves significant cash flow to grow production and to return cash to shareholders or reduce debt. So just to give you a little bit of color on that.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Rob, and does that include the ongoing acreage spend you would have?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yes.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That is actually a pretty good number. Could you just refresh us on priorities for use of free cash flow?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Well I mean, so in the immediate future, with the separation, we're going to realign the balance sheets of both EQT and EQM. We have moderated growth projections, but in the projections that you guys have seen over the past six months from upper teens and the low 20s now to low teens. But that, I think that is subject to move based on what the market does, what gas pricing does, what transportation does out of the industry. And then clearly, returning cash to shareholders is a priority. So I think it's going to be a mix of moderate growth and returning cash to shareholders once we have used some of the proceeds from these streamlining transactions to realign the balance sheets.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just one follow-up on that, Rob.","David E. Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Drew, the bias is always to return money to shareholders. Everything else is going to be viewed against that standard. Any type of the growth, et cetera, it's always going to be viewed against the possibility of giving, returning capital to shareholders.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very clear. Okay. Thanks. One last one, just to follow-up on the comment about aligning the balance sheets. Do you think there's the potential for any debt that's currently recoursed to the parent to go to EQM? You guys talked about, I think, the RMP debt will be transferred over and be recoursed now to EQM. Is there any additional potential debt that would go to the midstream?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Well, no. The RMP debt is a revolver that we will take out. So it won't become recoursed to EQM, but EQM will just take that out. We are taking about $1.2 billion up to EQT in the drop transaction, and that cash will be used to pay down the EQT revolver. There are not bonds at EQT that will become recourse at EQM, but we do have some relatively near-term maturities, some in 2019. And so we will use additional funds to pay down some of that debt. But effectively, we will move well over $1 billion of debt that was at the EQT level to EQM, which will put us more in line with both EQT and EQM's leverage targets, so somewhere below two times at EQT and moving towards 1.5 times. And for EQM in that three to four times range, which will leave both businesses comfortably investment grade and I think fits their cash flow profile very well.","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's all very clear, guys. Thank you.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Okay, thanks, Drew.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Panjwani with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Quick question on the drop-down. I think you guys had previously talked about $130 million of EBITDA. It looks like, quickly going through numbers that the EBITDA near term kind of implied is closer to $150 million. So can you provide some color on what's driving the difference there?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yes. So I think that the $130 million number that was guidance that we gave about a year ago or at the time of the Rice merger. And so the 2018 number is bigger. I can't remember if the $130 million was next 12 months or it was a 2017 number, but it was one of the two. The $150 million, $160 million is a good number for 2018. And then you're pushing on towards $250 million to $260 million in 2019. So the growth profile is pretty steep, but that's what allowed the valuation that we are able to negotiate for that asset.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. And then looks like you guys sold your Permian assets. And I think the Huron is really the only remaining non-core assets left at the upstream level, so any thoughts on monetizing that? Any other non-core assets we should be aware of?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Sameer, we're not going to comment on any M&A or divestitures or acquisitions. We just as a matter of course don't do it.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Thank you. Welcome back, Dave.","David L. Porges - EQT Corp.","She says gingerly.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Maybe just a macro and a micro. First on the hedges, it looks like you've added a fair amount of swaps in 2019. Is there anything maybe structurally or how we should think about the hedge book here kind of on a go-forward basis?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","I think, we were fairly light on our 2019 hedge book compared to where we historically would be given the proximity of 2019 to where we are. So it's just normal course. Don't read anything more than that into it.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, great. And then maybe just kind of think through that the lower strip, I mean we're in backwardation it seems like forever. Is there \u2013 you talk about sort of a moderate growth rate and then returning cash to shareholders. Is there any thought with kind of the lower strip in the out years moderating that growth rate even further, which I think you guys have outlined as sort of lower teen level?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","It's certainly a consideration. It's something that we think about here internally and talk to the board about and will obviously be ongoing.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, that's clear. Thank you, guys.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Okay, thanks, Holly.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Patrick J.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Patrick Kane, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Thank you, Mr. Kane. You may begin.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's conference call. With me today are Steve Schlotterbeck, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob McNally, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Schlosser, Senior Vice President and President of Exploration & Production; and Lisa Hyland, Senior Vice President and President of Midstream. The replay for this call will be available this evening for seven days. The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415. The confirmation code is 13650782. The call will also be replayed for seven days on our website.","First a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued our second quarter earnings release and posted a slide presentation. Both are available on our website at www.eqt.com and include, among other things, comments regarding EQT's pending acquisition of Rice Energy. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval.","In connection with the proposed transaction, EQT expects to file with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement later today. These and other documents filed by EQT and Rice with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at EQT's website, www.eqt.com, or Rice's website, www.riceenergy.com, as applicable, or at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. You should review such materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the proposed transaction.","To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM, and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is 201-689-7817.","In a moment, Rob and Dave will summarize EQT's second quarter results and Steve will give a brief update on the Rice acquisition. Following the prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Lisa will be available to answer your questions.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements listed in today's press release and under Risk Factors in EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the SEC and available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob McNally.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Before reviewing the second quarter results, I do want to briefly give you an update on the Rice Energy acquisition. As a reminder, on June 19, we announced our intent to acquire Rice for 0.37 EQT shares plus $5.30 per Rice share. As Pat mentioned, the Proxy Statement will be filed later today and will be available on our website, Rice's website or the SEC website. Steve is going to have further comments on the transaction in a few minutes.","Okay. I'll provide an overview of the second quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.06 compared to a $0.38 loss in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $223 million as compared to $105 million for the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $118 million. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results.","Moving to Production, Production sales volume of 198 Bcfe for the second quarter was 7% higher than the second quarter of 2016 and was slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter of last year.","Operating revenue for the production company totaled $631 million for the second quarter of 2017, which was $554 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $578 million or 10% higher quarter-over-quarter, consistent with volume growth. Transmission expenses were almost $38 million higher due to volumes transported on the Rockies Express Pipeline and the Ohio Valley Connector.","As mentioned on our first quarter call, we were paying for some Rex capacity last year. But since we're unable to physically move our produced gas to Rex in the second quarter of 2016, we'll use that capacity for marketing. When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense.","Processing expenses were $17.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes, primarily related to our recent acreage acquisitions. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Production taxes were $1.8 million higher as a result of higher impact fees due to increased drilling activity in Pennsylvania and better pricing.","Lease operating expenses, excluding production taxes, were $3.3 million lower. Excluding the impact of prior year pension settlement and legal expenses, SG&A was slightly favorable for the quarter, as we reduced our Kentucky cost structure when we integrated the Kentucky gathering operations into production in 2016.","During the quarter, our liquid story was strong, reflected by an increase in volumes and a higher pricing environment. NGL sales volume and realized price were significantly higher. Regarding pricing, the average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $2.86 per Mcfe, a 36% increase compared to the $2.11 per Mcfe in the second quarter of last year.","The average differential for the quarter, which was a negative $0.64 per Mcfe, was within the stated guidance range for the quarter. This is a $0.51 decrease from the first quarter of 2017, but a $0.15 improvement from the second quarter of 2016. Approximately 80% of our local basis exposure for the balance of 2017 is locked in and is reflected in our differential guidance.","The minimal effects of declined local pricing highlight the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provide significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. We continued to expect improvement in our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the Mountain Valley Pipeline project, which will provide access to the premium Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets.","Now moving to Midstream results, EQT Gathering operating income was $83.3 million, $10.1 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Operating revenue was $112.1 million, a $12 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. This was slightly offset by increased operating expenses, which totaled $28.8 million for the quarter, a $1.9 million increase over the same period last year.","Looking at EQT Transmission, second quarter operating income was $57.8 million, $1.9 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. Firm reservation fee revenue was $79.5 million, $19.2 million higher than the second quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of EQT contracting for additional firm capacity on the OBC. Operating revenues were $86.8 million, an $8.9 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, while operating expenses were $29 million, a $7 million increase over the second quarter of 2016, with approximately $5 million of the $7 million increase being DD&A.","I'll close my remarks by providing you with our liquidity update. We closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with zero net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $561 million of cash on the balance sheet, which excludes EQM. We're forecasting $1.2 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. We're fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, which excludes EQM and land acquisitions, with the expected operating cash flow and the current cash that we have on hand.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to David.","David Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As Rob mentioned, our sales volume for the second quarter was 198 Bcfe, which exceeded the high-end of guidance by 3 Bcfe. Operationally, we now have seven frac crews secured and expect to operate at this pace for the remainder of the year.","With these crews in pace, we anticipate approximately 55 Marcellus and Upper Devonian wells to be turned in line in the third quarter and 58 in the fourth quarter. This is approximately three times the pace of the first six month of this year, during which we had 19 wells turned in line in the first quarter and 17 wells in the second quarter.","As you would expect, the production impact of this increased completion activity will be weighted to the fourth quarter and is reflected in our current guidance. Additionally, with the success of our ongoing consolidation efforts, we now expect our 2017 drilling program to have an average lateral length of 8,400 feet, which is 11% higher than our 2016 average.","Now, let's move onto our Deep Utica test program. As we've mentioned during previous calls, our capital is allocated to projects that we expect will deliver the best returns. And as we continue to lengthen laterals and improve efficiency in the Marcellus, the hurdle rate for other investments continues to increase.","As an example, given the contiguous acreage position of the pending Rice transaction, we expect Marcellus wells in Greene and Washington counties to average at least 12,000 feet. Based on recent Utica results and current development costs, we estimate a Utica well will need to achieve at least 4 Bcf per 1,000 feet to be competitive with a 12,000 foot Marcellus well. And so far, we believe there are only two Deep Utica wells that meet or exceed that threshold. In short, we have multiple years of long lateral inventory in the Marcellus. And when comparing the two plays, it is difficult for the Utica to compete.","For these reasons, we have made the decision to suspend our Utica test program and focus our efforts on Marcellus development as we integrate the assets we've acquired over the past year and a half. This year's Utica program was planned to contribute 18 Bcfe to our annual volume. Therefore, the suspension will impact our production guidance which is now adjusted to be 205 Bcfe to 210 Bcfe for the third quarter and 825 Bcfe to 840 Bcfe for the full year.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everybody. As you're aware, the big news of the quarter was the June 19 announcement that we entered into an agreement to acquire Rice Energy. Rice is an outstanding strategic and operational fit for us and we anticipate the combined entities will capture significant operating efficiencies, improve overall well economics and deliver stronger returns to our shareholders.","We also believe this transaction will enhance our options to address EQT's sum-of-the-parts discount, which we have previously discussed. We have spoken with many of our shareholders and other industry experts since the announcement and we are pleased with the positive, enthusiastic feedback received. In discussing this compelling transaction, we received questions on our ability to address the sum-of-the-parts discount and around our synergies estimates for the merger. I will address both of these topics today.","First, on addressing the sum-of-the-parts, the Rice acquisition does not impact the timing of addressing our sum-of-the-parts discount. In fact, we believe this transaction will enhance our options to address the sum-of-the-parts discount which we have previously discussed. Addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount is a priority for the board and we will develop a plan by the end of 2018 that we believe is in the best interest of EQT and all shareholders.","These options could include splitting the companies, selling one of the businesses, collapsing EQM and EQGP to support a buyback program, as well as several other scenarios. Our analysis will be a comprehensive one, which not only evaluates all feasible alternatives for addressing the discount, but will also include a full analysis of the potential tax implications of the current tax reform effort in Washington. As you can appreciate, this is a longer-term development and we do not have additional details to share.","The second most common question has been around synergies. We're confident that the PV of the synergies are in excess of the $2.5 billion laid out in the deal announcement. As you will see in our updated slide deck, which was posted to our website and filed with the SEC this morning, the $2.5 billion only covers categories of synergies, $1.9 billion of which are efficiencies driven by longer laterals, high grading the drilling program to drill longer laterals first and lower surface costs, including fewer roads, pads, water pits and well lines.","Those savings are in our control and we're forecasting $200 million in 2018 and $350 million per year for the following nine years. The other $600 million is from a reduction of $100 million of G&A per year discounted for 10 years. Given the overlap of the businesses and after careful evaluation, we believe the $2.5 billion is a conservative estimate and are confident in our ability to achieve these targets.","In addition to the quantified synergies, there are significant synergies that are harder to quantify. We listed them in our presentation this morning along with ranges of potential value. If you took the high end of the ranges of each category, the additional synergies are well in excess of the $2.5 billion that we've already quantified. A few examples are increasing well recoveries by combining EQT and Rice's best drilling and completion techniques is worth $500 million for every 1% increase in EUR per foot.","Increased leverage in acquiring drilling and fracking services is worth $300 million for every 1% improvement in service costs. And G&A savings beyond the 10 years is worth approximately $500 million. There are several other additional synergies discussed in our updated IR deck. And I would encourage you to review our new deck for the full slate of additional synergies.","I think you'll also conclude that our original estimate of $2.5 billion in synergies is very conservative and we expect to be able to exceed that amount by a fair margin. We continue to make strong progress towards completing the transaction and recently received antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission, one of the customary closing conditions of the transaction. Rice is an outstanding, strategic and operational fit for us and we're excited to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pat for Q&A.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Steve. That concludes the comments portion of the call. Doug, can we please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Scott.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, a question on \u2013 with the reduced activity in the Utica Shale, is some of that being reallocated to the Marcellus and \u2013 with the capital that was spent there? And...","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. Scott, some of that capital is being reallocated to completion of some DUCs that we acquired in the West Virginia acquisitions over the past year. So, not to new grassroots wells, but to the completion of a suite of DUCs.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay. Understood. And then, yeah, because that \u2013 I guess the completion pace you all have in the second half of the year, I mean, is significantly higher than obviously what you experienced in the front half of year. And I was kind of curious on why \u2013 and I don't know what the best way to look at this thing, but even relative to the frac crews you had, it seems a lot faster. So, I was just wondering what's some color on that.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I think we now have the frac crews in place and they're getting to work. And so the pace of completed wells is going to be higher, but DUCs as well will also \u2013 since we don't have to drill those wells, they're already drilled \u2013 will help us increase that pace quite a bit in the second half of the year.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. So the implied obviously growth into the fourth quarter that you all have is in excess of a sequential 10%. Then I would expect the exit rate should be pretty robust. I mean have you \u2013 do you have a sense of what that might look like?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","I don't think we've quoted that, but definitely the fourth quarter and heading into 2018 will \u2013 the growth rate will be significantly higher than it has been the last couple quarters.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. And then one last quick one. It looks like there is some reports that Rice acquired this LOLA Energy. Do you all have any comments on that and why would be taken place during this process?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, we don't have comments on that. I would defer you to Rice and\/or LOLA for questions on that. I guess my only comment would be we're very familiar with LOLA and the assets that they have and they fit very nicely in the core backyard of Greene and Washington counties. So they are definitely high quality assets, but questions regarding any potential transaction should be directed to those companies.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Hi, Drew.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Steve, I was hoping you can talk about the steps you might need to take to realize some of the upside to synergies that you identified like the marketing optimization or the longer laterals in West Virginia or any of the other ones that you think are relevant to speak to.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. So, maybe I should describe a few of those that probably aren't obvious. So the West Virginia laterals one, that's a \u2013 if you assume that we could increase the average lateral in West Virginia by 2,000 feet, at the same time, delaying a significant amount of the West Virginia development because we'll be more focused on Pennsylvania, so all that's incorporated into this number.","But the reason that we think that might be possible or at least the portion of that is possible is we've clearly found that time equals more length, especially in West Virginia, because of the, frankly, antiquated oil and gas regulations they have. It takes a lot of time to piece together longer laterals. And as a result of the Rice acquisition and shifting our focus to Pennsylvania, that will buy us a lot more time to work the existing locations in West Virginia. And, ultimately, they will be longer when we drill them than they otherwise would have been. So that's what is behind that.","And I would stress on the sheet in our IR presentation. Those are ranges of values. We're not necessarily saying that we expect to achieve 100% of all of those, but I would expect that we will achieve some amount of probably all of them or nearly all of them. And that's one. So, we picked 2,000 feet because we think that's plausible. But it will be hard to quantify and hard to measure and will occur somewhat down the road.","On the \u2013 I think the buying power is self-explanatory. That's just having more leverage because of our scale and negotiating service contracts. And\/or if that's not possible having enough scale and enough certainty with our drilling programs, if it made sense we could ourselves get into the service business \u2013 if that made more sense to make sure we got some synergies there, although I think more likely would be \u2013 that we're just able to negotiate better contracts.","The marketing optimization is again because of the scale and the amount of gas that we will have available to sell in our commercial group, that they will be able to negotiate better sales contracts. And that one is a $0.05 improvement in realized price. We deal $1.4 billion in value. I can't guarantee you will get $0.05, but we should be able to negotiate better sales contracts. So there should be some value there, for sure.","LOE optimization is again \u2013 we haven't built that into our synergies. But clearly because of the operational overlap of the two companies, we would fully expect to realize some unit LOE improvements. And we've quoted a $0.03 improvement in yields, $800 million in additional value. We talked about the G&A. We've only discounted that for 10 years. If you assume that that continues in perpetuity it's another $0.5 billion, but we tend to be more conservative on our estimate.","And, finally, the MVP expansion \u2013 because of the extra or the increased production that we'll have, it's possible that that expansion opportunity could be accelerated by up to three years which pulls forward that value and has a PV of about $200 million. And the biggest one is the thought that between the two companies we've got a lot of data on completion practices in this core area of the Marcellus and both companies have independently done a lot of science and analysis and gathered tremendous amounts of data.","And we put those two databases together and can explore the best techniques in various areas. Almost certainly we will be able to come up with best practices going both ways that improve the returns of our wells. Hard to predict how much that will be. But, for example, if we increased the EURs by 5%, that's an additional $2.5 billion of synergy. So that's a particularly powerful one and one that I fully expect to capture some if not all of that amount of synergy. That may be a little more long-winded than you wanted.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No. That's great. All the color really helps actually. So, just to follow-up on the West Virginia piece, with that \u2013 seeing as laterals involved swaps or some unitization or something, is that partly of what factor into how successful that upside is?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yes. It would frankly be doing more of what we're already doing, but having more time to do it. So, swaps for sure. We have a lot of acreage that overlaps with one of our big competitors down there. But swaps are particularly difficult to work out. You have different acreage dedications to different midstream companies. You have different net revenue interest, different terms in the leases. So, it takes a lot of effort to get the swaps done.","It also gives us more time to work on the joint development and co-tenancy legislation in West Virginia that we still feel needs to happen in West Virginia. And we still remain cautiously optimistic that with more time we will get that legislation through. That would be a big improvement for West Virginia lateral lengths and economics will make West Virginia more competitive in certain areas with our Pennsylvania opportunity. So, having more time to work on that before we drill the wells is certainly a big advantage.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Steve. I appreciate that. And just one follow-up just on kind of the macro within Appalachia. It seems like there's still a number of these smaller operators or even, let's just say, assets that are in the market that might make sense to consolidate whether by you or someone else. Do you see a lot of those still out there? Are there areas where there's a lot of disparate acreage that could be consolidated by someone or do you see other willing sellers out there, in addition to Rice?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Drew, I think, with the acquisitions we've done in West Virginia and now with the Rice transaction, our appetite for additional significant acquisitions is satisfied, I think. I think, with the Rice transaction, our position is extremely well consolidated. There were still be holes. And I think we've estimated and told you all that we would expect you should be modeling about $200 million a year for fill-in opportunities to fill in those holes. But in terms of any more significant transactions to consolidate, I think, the Rice transaction accomplishes what we set out to achieve. And we're going to be focused on delivering on the results that we've been talking about.","So, but that said, I think, there are still lots of operators out there, lots of companies still trying to rationalize their positions and I think, ultimately, trying to do what we have just done and build contiguous acreage positions too, so they can improve their capital returns and their margins. So, I would expect you'll see continued activity, but I think except for the small little pieces and parts that we'll need to pick up to fill in some holes, I think, we're good for now.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It's all very clear, Steve. Thanks.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to get into one of those synergies maybe in a little more detail, the completion designs between the two organizations. Can you kind of maybe compare and contrast what you know about the two different completion designs and where you think there might be some room for some beneficial improvement from combination?","David Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Yeah, Michael. This is David. First, I'll say that \u2013 I'll congratulate Rice. They've done a lot of good testing and they've documented it very well and so have we. So I'm just really confident that when we marry the two organizations together, there is going to be things that offset each other and improve EURs. Some areas that we're looking at now are \u2013 they do some interesting things in targeting their wells that we haven't experimented with and even what they're calling engineering completions by trying to pick better parts of the rock based on log (30:00) properties instead of perforating every 40 feet like most companies do. So there is a couple things that jump out where they've tested those concepts and we haven't tested them as much. So when we get that data in and absorb it, we're confident we can make some tweaks.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Makes sense. And then on the completions pace that you guys detailed for the second half, that's helpful. I'm just curious, would the expectation be that you maintain those seven crews through the first half of 2018 and that sort of quarterly pace in completions is sustainable? How should we think about that going in the second half?","David Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Yes. This is David again. Yeah. That's what I would \u2013 I think that's a good assumption, that we'd be somewhere in that range for the first half of 2018.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. And then last one on my end was just on the...","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Sorry, just one clarification on that piece. That would just be for the EQT run rate. There would be additional crews because of the Rice acquisition. So we would be at a higher number than 7 in 2018.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Understood. That's what I was getting at. I appreciate the clarification. Yeah. And then I guess the last one on my end is just \u2013 I was just curious on the tax side of things in the context with the sum-of-the-parts paths that you laid out. I understand there is some uncertainty on tax treatment and perhaps a little limited on what you can disclose. But maybe can you just provide a little bit of color on each of those paths, like how the different tax treatments might vary and just how important you view the tax impacts relative to the path of addressing the sum-of-the-parts?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","As Steve said, we're committed to addressing the sum-of-the-parts issues in 2018. I'm not going to comment on any particular path forward. But we don't believe that taxes will be the deciding factor in whatever it is that we decide to do, or importantly, with regard to the timing of when we're able to do it.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Clear enough. Thank you very much.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","You bet.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen. Steve, I don't want to belabor the synergies, but it's such a positive important part. I just want to make sure I'm clear on that slide 14. Generally, timing on \u2013 you walked pretty detailed through the $2.5 billion. Just wondering that additional $5 billion. I mean is that a year or so after Rice closes too? I'm just trying to get a very general sense of how you kind of envision the timing of those other $5 billion?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. Well, if you look at the slide 14, it's actually an additional $7.5 billion of potential. So I do want to be clear. The numbers that are shown on that page are all the numbers at the high-end of the ranges. And I think it's probably a bit optimistic to assume that we could capture all of that. So I don't want anyone to take away from this that we're saying we're going to get another $7.5 billion on the top of the $2.5 billion.","I do fully expect we will get some amount probably from each of those categories. And it's probably a good time to mention this. One of the reasons that we didn't provide these upfront is these \u2013 to your question, Neal, these are far more difficult to prove and to do a look back on and demonstrate that we captured it and to quantify how much we got and when we got it, because of the nature of them versus the two categories of synergies that we talked about initially, which, A, we have extremely high confidence we will get at least that much, and, 2, We will easily be able to demonstrate how we performed versus those estimates. These will be much more difficult to demonstrate how much we were able to get.","So, with that caveat, these were all \u2013 so the ones that are related to a development program, so like incremental EUR improvements, that was to get to the $2.5 billion, I'd assume 5% of every well point forward. So, that assumes starting day one, so that's probably frankly a bit aggressive. It will take a little time to study the \u2013 to get the data in, have the engineers look at it, implement new practices, but that applies to several thousand wells. So if we missed a first few dozen, it probably doesn't change the value that much. And most of them are similar. It assumes applying that improvement on the pro forma development plan.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great detail, Steve, and just one follow-up, looking to slide 11, maybe for you or David. You've always talked about and been pretty clear about that rectangle and I get even the Rice piece and the Utica to the west of that. But you have a bit of a piece kind of call it to the Northeast of your acreage up in Armstrong and then you have a pretty good size piece down in West Virginia as well. I'd call it \u2013 that's southern acreage just outside of that. How do you view that acreage that is just outside of that block? Is that something you would let expire or because it's so close to the block you still \u2013 view it still pretty positively?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, in terms of expiring most of that acreages held by production, so it won't expire. We don't view it as favorably as the Greene, Washington county core, for two reasons. One, the geology is not quite as good. The rock is just not as good. It's not pad but it's not as good. And because of the consolidation efforts we've done in Greene, Washington and Northern West Virginia. That's where we're going to be able to drill the long laterals and that's where the capital efficiency is going to be dramatically improved. So, from a competition for capital standpoint, those corners of the box just won't compete for our capital but might be attractive to someone else, but you won't see a lot of activity from EQT in the corners of the box.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great detail, Steve. Thanks so much.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Steve, slide 16 suggests that you're not just kind of playing lip service to addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount with plans to have something by the end of 2018. I did want to see if you could give your thoughts on the activist letter that you did receive in the early part of July and thoughts on that.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I will certainly say it's not lip service and I'm trying to be as clear as I can that you have my personal commitment that we are going to address the sum-of-the-parts and we're going to do it in a way that we think is most beneficial to our shareholders. So, that's about as clear I know how to be. But I mean what I say. So, there is a strong commitment there.","Yeah. Regarding the JANA letter, I think, we met with them shortly after the letter came out. So they are a significant shareholder and we're trying to reach out to all of them. And we discussed the merits of the transaction and we discussed the merits and the opportunities to address the sum-of-the-parts. And I think I'll leave it at that that just like all of our shareholders we communicate with them. We don't always agree on everything. But we made our case and we still continue to feel very strongly that this Rice transaction creates significant value for our shareholders and is the best and most appropriate next step in EQT strategy.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's very helpful. I have two quick others. One, as you talk about closing the transaction in the fourth quarter, just given the lag between permits and drilling and completing kind of the 12,000 foot wells, when, Steve, do you anticipate that you could start drilling or producing, I guess, the 12,000 foot laterals in the core of the Marcellus? What is the approximate timing on that as we think about 2018, 2019?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","That's a good question because you're right. We will have to re-permit and we can't begin that process until closing. So, there will be a time period where we're re-permitting wells. Hopefully that moves fairly quickly. But as you may be aware, Pennsylvania in particular right now is \u2013 the DEP is a little bit slow on permit. So there will be a few months to get that done. And then because of the timing on these large pads with long laterals, that's typically about a year from spud to on average TIL. So I would say it will be late 2019 at the earliest and early 2020 before you really see the production from the longer laterals hitting our income statement.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I mean, are you going to get some before the whole program gets into that 12,000 foot mode or it'd be later in 2019?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. That's where you really start to see it in full development mode. Some will certainly come sooner. And even absent the Rice transaction, on the EQT side, we currently have plans to drill quite a few wells that are north of 12,000 feet where our own acreage allows it. So you will see some longer laterals coming even before the Rice transaction closes or before we start to get the benefits from it. But by the end of \u2013 by early 2019 is when you will see the full forced effect of the combined company.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just my final question, Steve, on the Rice merger call, you made some interesting comments about Phase 2 of shale and talking about better balancing growth with buybacks and dividends and I guess your expectations pro forma to reach a free cash flow surplus in 2019, I believe, under the $3 gas. So, wondering how shareholders have responded to that and how \u2013 if this is something that you're committed to as well as you think about on a go forward basis.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yes. That's another great question. First of all, the shareholder response, I think, has been \u2013 it's been extremely well received. And I've been very pleased at that because I wasn't quite sure how it will be received even though I think it is clearly the most prudent strategy for companies in the natural gas business. And you're hearing more companies start to talk about that, which I think is also a very positive development. I will say \u2013 that's another, so I'm going to go back to the Rice transaction.","Another reason, I think, this transaction is so transformative for our shareholders is not only is it accretive immediately to EQT shareholders, not only does it give us an industry-leading cost structure and capital efficiencies in a very competitive commodity market, it will allow the strategy of prudent and profitable growth with return of cash to shareholders to really happen. Absent those cost improvements and the capital efficiencies, it's much harder to adopt that strategy and be able to sustain it and do it in a way that really moves the needle. But with our ability to drill these long laterals and the lower cost structure, I think, it really makes that strategy extremely compelling. So, yes, that is what we are headed toward. And I think you really start to see the benefits of it probably in 2020, when we are growing we think in the mid-teens and substantially less than our cash flow.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Hi, Holly.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Holly.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Yeah. Maybe first for Steve or David, just kind of thinking through that 2018 development plan. You note the co-development this year and average well pad of 14 wells. I guess, any thought on this and kind of 2018 and beyond, I guess meaning both the size of the well pads as well as the co-development?","David Schlosser - EQT Corp.","By co-development, you mean Upper Devonian or...","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Yes.","David Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Yes. Well, first on the well pad, yes, 14 is our 2017 average. I expect that number to be increasing every year until it reaches \u2013 hopefully if we get to our range of 20 or so, which we think is the maximum size for a pad now. So you should see that continue to increase over the next few years. As far as co-development, I think, we're going to continue to do the Upper Devonian where it makes sense. We understand it. We know the performance of it now. We know where it works. And so where it works, we intend to still develop it.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","And I would add, on the Upper Devonian, it's really about the use it or lose it proposition, which makes it different than the Utica in terms of the Utica now can't compete with the longer laterals. The Upper Devonian laterals can also get longer. And the Utica isn't going away. So if that opportunity gets proved up by someone else any time soon, we have that opportunity and can restart activity there quickly without losing anything. In those certain areas of the Upper Devonian, we do strongly believe that you lose that opportunity.","But I think what you will see, Holly, is going forward a diminishing share of Upper Devonian relative to Marcellus. So we have even more compelling Marcellus opportunities now that Upper Devonian will have to compete with. And you may see us avoid those areas of Upper Devonian for now, so we don't lose it, but we will be drilling long Marcellus wells outside of that Upper Devonian co-development area. So I do think you will continue to see some Upper Devonian capital deployed. But as a proportion of our total capital, I think, you will see a steady decline and probably a fairly dramatic decline.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Great. And then maybe one just on the midstream side. You highlight the MVP expansion and kind of your upside to synergies. I would imagine there is some thought around OVC as well, but also within the presentation, you kind of note higher returns to EQM and lower cost to EQT. So I'm just curious if you could provide a little bit of color just around maybe the cost structure on midstream and how the synergies create sort of a lower cost midstream business?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Holly. It's Rob. I think that when you look around at where we overlap with Rice, that we overlap both on the upstream and the midstream side. And so it's going to require less capital to deploy the midstream solution for whatever drilling that we do. And some of that may accrue to the midstream business and some of that may accrue to the upstream business, but there clearly will be less capital required to gather the volumes that get drilled.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Great. And then maybe just one final quick one. Is there an update to the Permian sale?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Nothing at this point.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","David Schlosser - EQT Corp.","Hi, Brian.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Hi, Brian.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A little bit of a theoretical question on the Utica. To what degree is the decision to reduce activity in the Utica a function of the Utica no longer meeting return thresholds versus the potential for the synergies that are driving the opportunities, if Rice closes? I.e., would you have made the same decision on reducing activity in the Utica had the Rice transaction not been on the horizon?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Yeah. Brian, I think, the truthful answer is I don't know. The Rice transaction made it an easy decision given that the hurdle for the Utica to be better than our Marcellus opportunities went up significantly. So it was pretty obvious decision because of the Rice transaction. Absent the Rice transaction, I think, we were probably still in test mode with the thought that we could get there. One thing we have learned over the past six months is while, in a lot of cases, we can drill wells in that $12 million to $14 million range, still occasionally, you have a troublesome well and the costs go well above that.","And when you average that in, the learning curve was going to be probably a little longer than we thought. So we would have \u2013 absent the Rice transaction, we would have been incorporating that and trying to figure out, well, how confident are we that the average will be in that range and we probably need to get the results of a few more wells. So my guess would be we'd probably drill a few more wells to get the data and then make a decision and it could have gone either way. But with the Rice transaction, it's a no-brainer. We just don't think our Utica opportunities are likely to be able to compete with our new Marcellus opportunities.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","So, just one clarification on that, Brian, that I don't think we've said today. When we're talking about the Utica, we're only talking about the Deep Utica in Pennsylvania. We're not referring to the Ohio Utica that comes with the Rice transaction. Economically that competes much better with the Marcellus.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Great. And my follow-up is actually a follow-up to Holly's question earlier on the Upper Devonian. My take, and maybe I misunderstood it is that you may develop the core Upper Devonian a little bit more slowly because of better rate of return opportunities elsewhere post the transaction. But looking on the map on page 20, it would seem that the core Upper Devonian does overlap with a lot of the Rice \u2013 some of the Rice acres in the Marcellus. Can you just comment or maybe clarify?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Well, it does overlap with some of it and that's why I said you shouldn't expect Upper Devonian to go to zero. But a lot of the Rice opportunity lies outside of that and on the fringes of that. We may make the decision that the cost-benefit is more marginal. But certainly within \u2013 in the heart of that block, if we were going to drill, I think, we still feel strongly that we create value for our shareholders by taking the Upper Devonian versus forgoing that opportunity forever.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Right.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","But it's not all the Rice produce. These maps are kind of cartoonish, so you have to be careful about them.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And is there some quick...","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is there some quick and easy way of thinking based on your economics or your views on how much of a higher gas price you feel you need for the Upper Devonian economics to be equal to the Marcellus economics?","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Never.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Never.","Steven Schlotterbeck - EQT Corp.","Because if gas prices go up, the Marcellus economics go up. I don't think the Upper Devonian \u2013 the one thing that can equalize Upper Devonian with Marcellus in certain areas in certain circumstances, probably not even areas, circumstances is if the Upper Devonian has not been drilled, but the Marcellus has. And we have the opportunity to drill, say \u2013 I won't get the numbers quite right, but 16,000 foot Upper Devonian is probably economically equivalent to a 12,000 foot Marcellus. And, again, we'd have to check the numbers, but it's something like that.","And if the Marcellus is drilled, because the two companies have drilled wells say toe-to-toe, but the Upper Devonian hasn't been drilled, so the combined acreage allows a 16,000 foot Upper Devonian. The return on that investment is probably identical to a 12,000 foot Marcellus well that we would drill. So there will be certain circumstances where extra-long Upper Devonians are just as good as your average Marcellus.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.

And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Patrick Kane, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Christine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in EQT Corporation's conference call. With me today are Steve Schlotterbeck, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob McNally, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Schlosser, Senior Vice President and President of Exploration and Production; and Lisa Hyland, Senior Vice President and President of Midstream.","This call will be replayed for a seven-day period beginning at approximately 1:30 P.M. Eastern Time today. The telephone number for the replay is 201-612-7415, with the confirmation code of 13650780. The call will also be replayed for seven days on our website.","To remind you, the results of EQT Midstream Partners, ticker EQM and EQT GP Holdings, ticker EQGP, are consolidated in the EQT's results. Earlier this morning, there was a separate joint press release issued by EQM and EQGP. The partnerships will have a joint earnings conference call at 11:30 A.M. today, which requires that we take the last question at 11:20. The dial-in number for that call is 201-689-7817.","In a moment, Rob will summarize EQT's first quarter 2017 results, and Dave will give a brief operational update, followed by comments by Steve. Following their prepared remarks, Steve, Rob, Dave and Lisa will be available to answer your questions.","I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release, under Risk Factors in the EQT's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website.","Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob McNally.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everybody. Before reviewing first quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed two acquisitions, adding 67,400 core Marcellus acres for $652 million funded with cash on hand. We've been very active consolidating our acreage position in our Marcellus core, increasing our position by over 222,000 net acres, which represents the most Marcellus acres acquired by a single producer since 2015.","On the pricing side, we have seen significant improvement throughout our various markets. The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 realized in the first quarter of last year. This stronger pricing environment was also reflected in our average differential for the quarter, which was negative $0.13 per M. This is a $0.54 improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016 and a $0.09 improvement from the first quarter of 2016.","The improved pricing also highlights the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets. During the quarter, additional contracted capacity and higher utilization of this capacity to move our gas to these markets resulted in both higher realized price and higher transportation costs for the quarter compared to our guidance. We expect continued improvement to our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the MVP pipeline, which will provide access to the premium Southeast market. As you will see in our updated slide deck, we expect our basis to improve from negative $0.25 in 2017 to negative $0.13 in 2019, based on forward pricing at our markets.","I'll now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.43 compared to $0.05 in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $322 million as compared to $217 million in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners' and EQT GP Holdings' results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results.","EQT recorded $86.7 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $82.7 million in the first quarter of 2016.","Starting with Production results. Production sales volume of 190 Bcfe for the first quarter was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2016, which was on the low end of our guidance, as we completed fewer wells than we had planned for the first quarter. As discussed, the realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 in the first quarter of last year.","Operating revenues totaled $828.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, which was $345 million higher than the first quarter of 2016. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $571.2 million, or 17% higher quarter over quarter.","Transmission expenses were $43.4 million higher due to volumes moved on Rockies Express Pipeline and the Ohio Valley Connector. We were paying for some Rex capacity last year, but since we were unable to physically move our produced gas to Rex in the first quarter of 2016, we used that capacity for marketing.","When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized. The cost of the pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense. The increased transportation expense this quarter was largely due to us using more of our own transportation capacity to move our gas, driving higher transportation costs and higher realized prices.","Processing expenses were $16.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes. Production taxes were $6.2 million higher as a result of better pricing. Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth. Excluding a legal charge of $5 million, SG&A was essentially flat, while lease operating expense, excluding production taxes, were $1.6 million lower.","Moving on to midstream, EQT Gathering income was $73.6 million, $1 million higher than the first quarter of 2016 on increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $28.7 million, or $3.3 million than 2016.","Looking at EQT Transmission, operating income was $71.5 million, 11% higher than the first quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $13.3 million higher over first quarter 2016, primarily due to EQT's firm commitment on the OVC, or Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service in October 1, 2016.","Operating expenses were $29.6 million or $6.3 million higher than the same quarter of 2016. And then finally, our standard liquidity update, we closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with zero net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $857 million of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes EQM.","We currently forecast about $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP. So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, excluding EQM and EQGP, with that expected operating cash flow, as well as the current cash that we have on hand.","Okay. With that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. For those of you that I have not met, I am David Schlosser, and I was appointed President of EQT's Production business unit in March of this year. I have been with EQT for 10 years and have been employed in the oil and gas industry for about 29 years, with the majority of my time spent on the operations side. I most recently managed the engineering, geology and planning functions for EQT Production, and I have been involved with the growth and expansion of EQT's Marcellus and Utica development program since inception.","I will now make some comments about the quarter. As Rob mentioned, our sales volume for the first quarter was at the low end of guidance at 190 Bcfe. This was primarily driven by completing fewer wells than planned as we did not add frac crews as quickly as anticipated due to the tighter than expected market. We are, however, reiterating our full-year guidance and have additional frac crews scheduled to come on at the beginning of June, at which time, we expect to quickly get back on track with our 2017 turn in line schedule.","Our business plan also anticipated sales volumes to be flat Q2 versus Q1. We are now projecting Q2 sales volume between 190 and 195 Bcfe. Our 2017 growth will be back-end loaded as we expected, and we will exit 2017 at approximately 2.6 Bcf per day.","As you saw in today's news release, we recently increased our EUR estimates for our core Marcellus by 14% to 2.4 Bcfe per 1,000 foot. This reflects enhancements to our standard frac design, which among other things, increased the sand and water per foot of pay.","We continue to experiment with even larger frac jobs, which we expect will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the fracs. At this point, however, it is too early to know if the economics will be improved, because as you may expect, with bigger jobs come higher costs, as well as impacts to lateral spacing. We are confident in our technologies and methodology and we'll provide updates as our progress continues.","On the last call, Michael Hall asked about our well results in the dry Marcellus window in West Virginia. We currently have only 10 wells producing in Marion and eastern Wetzel County, but our preliminary EUR estimate for this area is 2.4 Bcfe per 1,000 foot, which is consistent with our average EUR for our core development area. We are very encouraged by this productivity.","Finally, an update on our Utica program. As we've indicated during previous calls, we continue to work in understanding the reservoir and improving costs and have decided to not share individual well results as we move along. We have completed the Big 177 well in Wetzel County, West Virginia, and it is online. Our 2017 plan calls for drilling seven wells and we are currently drilling the Moore well in Greene County, PA, and should have that well online in the second quarter. After we TD the Moore, we will move the rig to Armstrong County, Pennsylvania to drill the next Utica well. With these test wells, we are getting a better understanding of the production mechanisms, recoveries, and the economics of Utica, which was our overall goal of the 2017 program.","With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With this being my first call as CEO, I want to take a few minutes to comment on my strategy for EQT. I've been on the Management team for many years and have been an active participant in shaping and implementing our strategy, so in many ways it is a continuation of the strategy that EQT has been successfully executing.","The one thing I am most proud of as a member of the management team is EQT's history of focusing on creating shareholder value. From a large share buyback program in the early 2000s, the sale of our LDC business in 2013, to our creation of EQM and EQGP, and our current consolidation efforts, EQT has always focused on creating long term shareholder value. I assure you that I will continue to focus on doing what is best for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.","We are blessed to have an outstanding set of assets in one of the largest and most economic natural gas basins in the world. We are already the largest gas producer in the Marcellus, and the fourth largest in the U.S. We also have the largest midstream business in the Appalachian Basin. There are tremendous synergies between the two businesses that we have leveraged for the benefit of EQT, EQM and EQGP investors.","As you probably know, I believe there are significant benefits to consolidation in our core development areas. Over the past decade, we've made tremendous advances in operating efficiencies by focusing on finding ways to improve how we drill and complete our wells. These improvements have dramatically lowered the per unit cost of the gas we develop.","Unfortunately, these improved techniques are easily transferred between producers, and the advantages gained are short-lived as other producers adopt the same best practices. So while our development operating costs have improved dramatically, the economic value added has not increased in concert, as the supply of gas increase, pushing gas prices down.","The next wave of efficiencies will come from consolidation of the scattered acreage positions in Appalachia. This consolidation will drive longer laterals, more wells per pad, improved water and operating logistics and more efficient gathering and transmission pipelines. These advantages will be more difficult to replicate and the consolidators will hold a competitive advantage that will yield higher returns for their shareholders. I think further consolidation within the Marcellus core is the best path to creating a sustained competitive advantage, increasing shareholder value.","To date, we've been very successful implementing this strategy, and we are beginning to see the value creation from it. We've added over 220,000 core Marcellus acres since the beginning of 2016. Our focus is on adjacent acreage to what we already own and has facilitated an increase in average lateral length of our Marcellus wells from 5,900 feet in 2015 to over 8,000 feet in 2017. As you can see on our slides, at a constant $2.50 local gas price, adding 2,000 lateral feet increases returns from 39% to 52%. As we continue to consolidate, I think it is realistic for us to get to a point where we are drilling 10,000 foot laterals, increasing returns at the same gas price to 62%.","Our midstream business also benefits from our consolidation efforts. By increasing our inventory, the runway for midstream investments supporting production gets longer. This opens the door to build gathering systems, and makes MVP expansion and interstate pipes further south more likely. As we implement initiatives to strategically expand our footprint and drive stronger returns, we remain squarely focused on innovation throughout our operations. I am proud of our culture of innovation at EQT, and we are focused on leveraging that to continue to improve safety, reduce operating costs and improve returns on our investments. In my opinion, the commodities price cycles are here to stay, and we need to be profitable throughout the cycle. A continued focus on innovation will enable us to achieve these objectives.","I thank you for your continued support as shareholders of EQT, and I'll now hand the call over to Pat Kane.","Patrick J. Kane - EQT Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Christine, you could open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Phillip Jungwirth with BMO. Please proceed with your question.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Good morning.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Morning.","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Morning.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","How dependent is the 15% to 20% growth target through 2018 to 2020 on the targeted in-service date for Mountain Valley? And realizing you're still on schedule today, but if timing were to slip by say six months, would this alter growth plans at all? Or would you just anticipate selling more gas at M2 and having lower realizations and transportation costs?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Yes, Phillip, I don't think the timing of MVP, although I will reiterate we still expect to be on target for an end of 2018 turn in line. But if delays would happen, I wouldn't expect it would affect our growth rate at all. I think you nailed it. It would affect our netbacks in that time period from end of 2018 until turn in line, a little bit, we would sell more gas locally, but shouldn't affect our growth rates at all.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then just following up on that, the Mountain Valley delivery point, as you guys note, is trading at NYMEX or really a premium to NYMEX. Wondering if you have any expectation for basis once Mountain Valley comes online and an additional 2 Bcf a day of gas is sold there?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Yes, Phil, I think, so we obviously expect there to be an impact once we deliver that kind of gas to that point. And there are a range of estimates from various services that are out there. I think our best view is something close to parity with NYMEX is what we're expecting, perhaps a few cents below NYMEX. But there are some services that I think it could continue to trade at a premium, so I think we're trying to take a bit of a pessimistic view and hope it ends up better than we expect.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And then, one of your Appalachia peers recently entered into a processing joint venture as it looks to expand its wet gas capacity, and then almost half of your undeveloped Marcellus locations are wet gas. So two questions, one, if you could just speak to your current processing capacity and utilization, and then, two, would you look to expand this, and is a joint venture an option?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Yes, so if I think \u2013 so we saw that announcement, and I thought that was actually a pretty brilliant move on their part. With our recent consolidation efforts focused on, not necessarily focused on, but ended up being more wet gas and as we reconfigure our future development plans to take advantage of those acquisitions, we are now forecasting to be wetter than we otherwise were. And I think as a result, now as we look out in the future, we think we probably have enough scale to consider opportunities like that, probably not necessarily going into it on our own, but something maybe similar to the deal that you described where we enter into a joint venture to provide some investment opportunities for EQM.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks a lot.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the frac crews, and just it sounds like you had some challenges in getting some start-ups. So maybe just give us a sense of how many crews do you have deployed today. And what will happen as we think about the back half? I think you cited maybe getting some additional crews around mid-year.","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Yes. This is David. So the story is, I think, as you know, we had reduced activity in 2016. As we began to ramp up in late 2016 and early 2017, we just got \u2013 we chose to be selective about who our service providers would be, and we were trying to pair the right mix of quality and price, and the market tightened up, I think as everybody knows, quicker than we expected, driven a lot by Permian activity, but \u2013 so we've been running two to three crews in the first quarter. We think by June, we'll be at six, ramping up to seven sometime in the third and fourth quarter, and that's how we'll finish out the year. But like I said, we made a conscious decision not just to jump at the first deal that was out there, and we're a little bit selective, and we'll be ramping up by mid-year.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","And, Arun, one more bit of color on that. Our contracts with our frac suppliers had penalty clauses that if they decided to leave, they would owe us some money, similar to the kind of contracts we've had with drilling companies where during the downturn, we elected to pay the penalties and release the rigs. A couple of our frac contractors decided to pay us the penalties to take their frac crews to jobs that were more profitable. So we will get some penalty fees, but that obviously is far less than the value of having the wells fracked on the schedule that we would have liked. But that said, I think we feel good that by the beginning of June we will have enough frac crews running to confidently tell you that we're going to make our full-year guidance, which obviously then projects a pretty dramatic increase in production in the second half of 2017.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And you guys cited, is it a 2.6 Bcfe per day kind of exit rate? Is that what you're calling for the year end exit rate? Or more of a fourth quarter kind of average?","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Yes, it's pretty much the fourth quarter average.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","2.6 Bcfe?","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Yes.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And just going back to the addition of the frac crews, can you comment on any greater inflationary pressure that you're seeing as you are ramping on in what looks to be a much tighter services kind of environment?","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Yes. Well, certainly, we did see inflation and we've built that into our numbers. I think when we issued the new IR presentation, we've built in a 15% service price increase. So we've built in what we think we are seeing, and what we're going to see for the remainder of the year. So it's in our numbers now and hopefully, we are past the worst of it.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","This is Rob. Arun, I think that the frac pricing is probably going to be up more than that 15%, but that's offset some by actually declines on the drilling side, because we had some older rig contracts that were at high prices that rolled off. So that's kind of a blended number across all the services.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. And my final question. Just looking at the cost structure, on a cash cost per unit basis, you did kind of raise the guide by about $0.07. A lot of that was kind of on the third-party gathering and processing side. Could you just talk about what drove that? And maybe some opportunities on a go-forward basis to take those costs down over time?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah. I think a big part of that is the processing costs, because of the acquisitions that we've done and the mix of wet and dry gas has gotten a bit wetter for us. And so, the processing costs go up, but then so do realizations. And some of it is also due to transportation where we're using more of our capacity to transport our gas as opposed to using it for marketing purposes which again also, it increases transportation costs, but also increases realizations.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thanks, gents.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Morning, gentlemen.","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Hi, Holly.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Hi, Holly.","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Morning.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Steve, maybe big picture, you talked quite a bit about this consolidation being the strategy. How should we be thinking about this kind of second half of the year and then maybe thinking through the funding of that?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Yes. Holly, I think we expect to continue to do similar types of deals as we've been doing, so the small to medium size asset deals are by far the most likely and most available. And I think we continue to be pretty optimistic that there will be a deal flow throughout the year, so attractive asset packages that fit very well with our strategy. And I think for now, the bulk of that could be paid for with cash on hand.","When you look at the maps, there are some obvious kind of merger type \u2013 not necessarily opportunities, but things where you put bigger packages together and really kind of change the landscape. Those obviously are much more difficult to do, much more unlikely, and if something like that were to come about, we'd have to take a hard look at how we would finance something like that. But I think for now, the strategy in the short term is to focus on the asset deals, because we think we can get some of those done, and we can finance those with available cash.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Perfect. And then maybe more of a micro question. And I think you've answered it with the frac crews, but just trying to bridge the gap between the 2Q production guide, and then you guys had a pretty good DUC number at the end of 1Q, so I'm assuming that that's just timing of these frac crews coming back online or coming back. And then maybe kind of thinking about the 1Q DUC number this year versus the 1Q 2016 DUC number, can you break down kind of the acquisition wells that you had in there versus kind of pure EQT?","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Yeah. Holly, this is David. I don't know if I have the Q1 off the top of my head, but I know in the Q, the current quarter, there's 35 DUCs in there from the latest acquisition. So of the 183, 35 of those are Stone DUCs.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. And then just the 2Q production guide to the DUC count, I'm assuming that's just kind of related to the timing of the frac crews.","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Yes, certainly is.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Two questions. Steve, the first one is just when you look at the co-development of both the Marcellus and Upper Devonian, I mean again, I know you've had some really nice slides out earlier that basically just shows how that increases on a per acre basis. Could you address that? I mean, for the quarter, I think you had 28 Marcellus, 19 Upper Devonian. Is that a split that we should continue to see? And are you sort of sticking by that because of this upside with the co-development? If you could just talk about that perhaps for the remainder of the year and into 2018.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Hey, Neal. Certainly, we continue to feel very strongly about the economics of co-development in that particular area of Upper Devonian that we specify in our investor presentation, where because of the geology and the results that we have in that area, it's pretty clear to us that it is the right economic decision. Outside of that box, it doesn't make sense to co-develop, even though in some of the areas, there is good Upper Devonian potential. It's just okay to wait to drill those wells until much later.","Regarding the current balance, it's a hard question to answer, Neal, because of the consolidation we've done. We are currently kind of incorporating the new acreage and redoing our development plans to focus on making the best investments we can. So that's shifting around our focus a little bit from certain areas into other areas, and we haven't really finished that. So it's a bit tough to answer that.","And I'll just mention that, maybe I'm getting a little off track here, but one other factor that's ongoing that can affect how we allocate capital between our development areas is around something called joint development and co-tenancy in West Virginia. We've talked about it a few times over the years. It's some legislative fixes to the old antiquated oil and gas laws in West Virginia that we in the industry have been trying to get updated for quite a while now. It remains in flux. We're hopeful there'll be a special session this summer where it gets brought up again. And the outcome of that could potentially have impacts on how we allocate our capital across that development area. So that's a long-winded answer to tell you that it's in flux and I can't give you a good number right now.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","No, that makes \u2013 go ahead.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","One thing to keep in mind on that is, we've only got Upper Devonian that we want to develop on about 20% of the core Marcellus acreage.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","So in the long run, that's probably a ratio that you would see. But in any short period of time, the mix can be meaningfully different.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, guys \u2013 go ahead, Steve. I'm sorry.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Just real quick, I don't want to beat this one to death, but the other part is, we're still playing a bit of catch-up from the cutback in early 2016, where we had cut back some of the co-development potential Upper Devonian wells that now the clock is ticking on those because of the nature of the co-development. So right now, we're in a bit of a catch-up mode, but that should be concluding here pretty quickly.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just one last one, Steve, on the consolidation. I remember speaking to you before, you mentioned about having to re-permit or doing some additional permitting on that versus what maybe had already been done with the previous owners. Is that still the case? How is that coming along? Anything you could mention on that?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Yeah, no, that is still the case, and that will continue to be the case as we bring in new acreage, because the whole reason for the acquisitions is to extend the laterals. And if we have the opportunity to do that, even if we permitted a well shorter, we want to go back and re-permit it to get the economic advantages. So that does build in a bit of a delay in some cases, but that's something that we plan for. And really, the delay this quarter is driven far more by the frac crew availability than any issues around that. We had properly planned and accounted for having to re-permit as we added acreage.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. That's where I was going with that. Thanks so much, Steve.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","David Schlosser - EQT Corporation","Hi, Brian.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Good morning.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Going back to the op cost point with, looking at the first quarter relative to annual guidance, it would appear the first quarter came in above where you've raised annual guidance to. Can you just give us a little bit more color? I know you don't have the quarterly guidance, but a little bit more sense of the moving pieces and the trajectory as we go through the year?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yeah, I think big picture, what you see is that the volumes are going to increase significantly in the second half of the year. And so, the per unit cost on a number of items will start to come down. I think that's the big picture answer to what we'd expect to see on a per unit basis.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Which would mean that essentially then if you're flat in the second quarter, you'd see the bulk of those decreases coming in the second half, if you're flat production wise.","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Yes. That's correct.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then going back to the M&A point, two questions there. You mentioned earlier you could do what you think might be available with cash on hand. While the cash may be there, what's your tolerance for higher leverage that would likely result? And then, do you see any relationship between scale and the ability to retain frac crews, lower services costs, et cetera?","Robert J. McNally - EQT Corp.","Maybe I'll answer the first part of that question and I'll let Steve or Dave answer the second part. It is important to us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet. There's a number of reasons that we've articulated in the past. And so, we will be cognizant of that when we think about how we would fund any future acquisitions. But we do have both debt capacity and equity markets available. And so, if the acquisitions make sense, we will be able to fund them and we'll manage the debt-to-equity mix to keep \u2013 to be sure that we stay on the right side of the rating agencies.","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Yeah. And, Brian, could you repeat the second part of your question?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. I guess I'm trying to see, and there probably isn't, if there's any read across from the, not necessarily getting the frac crews to stay in the area to some of the scale that you're looking for. Do you see the ability to further lower costs and increase efficiencies and retain frac crews from the type of scale and the M&A that you're looking to do?","Steven T. Schlotterbeck - EQT Corporation","Yes, I think \u2013 so I think the issue around the frac crews is a temporary phenomenon. A lot of equipment, a lot of crews were shut down during the downturn, and this rebound is happening fairly quickly, and as you know, really quickly in the Permian. A lot of the equipment and crews are fungible between basins. So we're seeing a lot of that. But I think over time, and I think fairly quickly, the service companies will recommission a lot of equipment and rehire a lot of the hands that were let go.","So I think there's a time period here where the demand is outstripping the supply, but that will equalize going forward. So I think I don't see any real long-term concerns around that, and certainly, not related to our consolidation efforts. I think consolidation only improves the efficiency of all of that activity means we can get more done with less crews as we consolidate.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.
