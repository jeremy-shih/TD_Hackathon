And good morning everyone. This morning we announced our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, sales increased 6.3% to $5.32 billion. Our same-store sales increased 3.2% by segment comp sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 5% and for the Family Dollar banner comp sales increased 1.5%.

Earnings per share increased 40.3% to $1.01. I\u2019m really pleased with the terrific third quarter our team delivered with the performance of each of our business segments, the Dollar Tree banner delivered a 5% comp, it\u2019s best quarterly comp since Q4 of 2014 along with 20 basis point improvement in its sector leading operating margin. ","The Family Dollar banner delivered positive same store sales of 1.5% and 190 basis point improvement in operating margin as we continue to gain traction in the business. Our Dollar Tree Canada team delivered another solid quarter of strong sales coupled with improved margins and expense control and our Dollar Tree direct business while a small portion of our business delivered low double-digit comp increases in both sales and visits to the sites. ","Dollar Tree highlights for the quarter include, our top performing categories for the quarter were snacks and beverage, food, household products, healthcare and stationary. Sales performance was led by discretionary as we delivered one of our best seasonal quarters in years, both consumables and discretionary comp did better than 4% for the quarter. ","All three months comp positively in the quarter, September was the strongest month in the quarter and geographically Dollar Tree same store sales growth was strongest in the Southwest, Northeast and Midwest and all of our zones delivered positive comps greater than 3%. ","Elements of Dollar Tree strong seasonal performance included Halloween as we delivered strong comp sales and improved seasonal inventory sell through greater than prior year\u2019s quarter, Fall Harvest also delivered solid comps during the quarter and inventory was well positioned as we entered the fourth quarter. Back-to-school was our best season in several years, and Christmas while it represents a small portion of Q3 as we received early inventory of our Christmas craft in early Day Core items. Our initial results were very encouraging. ","Dollar Tree continues to be strong, consistent and growing, this represent our 39th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales and operating margin continues to lead the value sector. Our third quarter performance again validates the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand, customers love our fixed price concept and continue to shop for value and convenience. ","We are very pleased with the traffic and sales results, our merchandize assortment and flow of inventory. Our business model continues to focus on customers wants and needs and it is a different shopping experience from the rest of retail. ","For the Family Dollar segment, the highlight for the quarter include top performing categories were snacks and beverage, refrigerated product, school and office supplies, and bedding. Our comp performance was driven by consumables. And sales cadence for the quarter were relatively balanced -- the quarter -- were balanced throughout the quarter with each month above 1% comp. September was the strongest comp of the quarter.","Geographically, Family Dollar same-store sales growth for the quarter was strongest in our West, Mid Atlantic and Northeast zones. Importantly, all eight major geographic zones delivered positive same-store sales for the quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress at Family Dollar around the key foundational elements that will drive enhanced performance, improving the store table stakes, focusing on merchandising value for the customer, and consolidating of shared services.","Evidence of our progress can be seen in our third quarter results, positive 1.5% same-store sales, 130 basis point improvement in gross margin, and 60 basis point SG&A leverage, and a total of a 190-basis point increase in operating margin. Feedback we are receiving from our Family Dollar shoppers indicate they are seeing cleaner stores, greater values on the items our customers buy most often, improving product assortments, more consistent in-stocks, and better customer service in our stores. We want to be the neighbourhood store of choice for the fill-in shopping needs of our Family Dollar customers that typically live, work, and shop near our stores. ","During the third quarter, we completed another 191 Family Dollar store innovations as part of our renovation initiative. We continue to be very pleased with the initial results we are seeing in these stores and especially about the feedback we are receiving from our customers and store teams.","Our target for fiscal 2017 is 350 stores and we will continue to renovate hundreds of older Family Dollar stores as we improve the business. Elements of the improved store layout include better adjacencies and more productive end caps, expanded beverage and snack, including immediate consumption coolers near checkout, headed assortment of food and coolers and freezers, updated air care assortments, expanded adult beverage in some stores, our shopper-friendly power alley to promote Dollar well items, and a faster checkout process for our customers.","Additionally, we continue to make progress as planned with elevating our private brand assortment in stores. These private brands are being developed to provide national brand comparable quality and terrific values to support the compare and save component of our smart ways to save program.","Each of our brands will contain a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. These brand improvements are taking place across the store and are already impacting performance in household products, candy, snack and beverage, hardware, vitamins and others. Examples of some of the new private brand labels you will see in Family Dollar, include Catawba Candy, Beats, [plus], Chestnut Hill in our food selection, Nature's Measure and Family Wellness in our health and beauty category, Home Line and Driver's Choice in our household products and Tool Bench in our home assortment.","Highlights for the quarter at Dollar Tree Canada included the fact that our stores are delivering better day-in day-out standards resulting in sales across all departments with encouraging growth on the discretionary side of the business.

","We opened two new stores in Canada bringing our total Canadian stores to 226. For Dollar Tree direct, the digital division of Dollar Tree is providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores. ","A few highlights of our Dollar Tree Direct business. We had another productive and profitable quarter as we experienced low double-digit increases in sales and traffic.

Overall, we were really pleased with our results through the business and are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead of us. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on the third quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. Kevin?","Kevin Wampler","Thanks, Gary and good morning. Total sales for the third quarter grew 6.3% to $5.32 billion, Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.8% to $2.69 million and Family Dollar segment total sales increased 3.8% to $2.63 billion. ","Enterprise same store sales increased 3.2% on a constant currency basis or 3.3% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations. On a segment basis, same store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 5% or 5.2% when adjusted for currency fluctuations and the Family Dollar banner increased 1.5%. ","Gross profit for the combined organization increased 9.6% to $1.67 billion for the third quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year's quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin improved 90 basis points to 31.3% versus 30.4% in the prior year's quarter.","Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 35.1% for the third quarter, a 30-basis point improvement compared with prior year\u2019s third quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance during the quarter included lower occupancy cost due to the leverage from the comp sales gain and lower merchandise costs based on improved markdowns. ","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 27.5% during the third quarter compared with 26.2% in the comparable prior year period. The 130-basis point improvement was primarily due to lower merchandise cost, lower markdowns, and distribution costs. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter improved 30 basis points to 23.3% from 23.6% in the same quarter last year.","Third quarter SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points to 23.3%, compared to the prior year's quarter of 23.2%. Higher store payroll cost, incentive compensation, and lower other income were mostly offset by lower utilities and depreciation as a percentage of sales. ","SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 23.4% compared to 24% in the prior year's quarter. The 60-basis point improvement was a result of lower depreciation cost, lower workers\u2019 compensation cost, lower payroll cost related to the harmonization of vacation policies and lower health insurance, utilities and debit and credit card fees, partially offset by higher expenses primarily related to incentive comp, repairs and maintenance, store supplies, advertising and legal fees. ","Operating income for the enterprise increased to $425.2 million compared with $342.4 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin improved 120 basis points to 8% for the quarter from 6.8% in last year\u2019s third quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 20 basis points to 11.8% when compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. ","Operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $51.5 million to $107.9 million, a 190-basis point improvement as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year's quarter.","Non-operating expenses for the quarter totalled $70.1 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.4% compared to 25.5% in the prior year's quarter. ","The prior year\u2019s third quarter included a one-time tax benefit of $21.4 million or $0.09 per share related to a 1% decrease in North Carolina\u2019s state tax rate, which decreased the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible assets.","For the third quarter, the company had net income of $239.9 million or $1.01 per diluted share compared to the reported net income of $171.6 million or $0.72 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. As a reminder, last year\u2019s Q3 reported earnings of $0.72 per share included both a $0.09 benefit related to the tax rates I just mentioned and a $0.09 charge related to debt refinancing costs. ","Looking at the balance sheet, combined cash and cash equivalence at quarter end totalled $400.1 million compared to $866.4 million at the end of fiscal 2016. Our outstanding debt is approximately $5.8 billion a decrease of $1.4 billion from the end of the third quarter of 2016. Company continues to focus on its stated goal of returning to investment grade with step rating, we expect our rent adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio to be below 3.5 times at fiscal yearend. ","Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end decreased 2% from the same time last year while square footage increased 4.6%. Inventory for selling square foot decreased 6.3%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter. ","Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end increased 9.2% from the same period last year and increased 6.9% on a selling square foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we\u2019re seeing in our in-stock levels on key items, we are continuing to review merchandize assortments and we believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter. ","Capital expenditures were $177.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 versus $95.6 million in the third quarter of last year. For fiscal 2017, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $680 million to $700 million. ","Capital expenditure will be focused on new stores and remodels along with the renovation of 350 Family Dollar stores. The company now expects to complete approximately 1,080 store projects in fiscal 2017 an increase of 65 for the beginning of the year. The increase is driven by approximately 100 additional Family Dollar renovations, net of approximately 30 less new Dollar Tree stores in 2017. ","In addition, CapEx includes the addition of frozen refrigerated capability to a total 400 new and existing Dollar Tree stores, expansion of frozen and refrigerated for 300 Family Dollar stores. IT system enhancement and integration projects and the initial phases of construction of a new Dollar Tree banner distribution center in Warrensburg Missouri and our store -- our Chesapeake store support center expansion. ","Depreciation and amortization totalled $149.4 million for the third quarter, depreciation and amortization expense was $157.6 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2017, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $610 million to $620 million. ","Our updated outlook for fiscal 2017 includes the following assumptions. Fiscal 2017 includes a 53 week, the extra week in the fourth quarter is expected to add $400 million to $430 million to sales and $0.19 to $0.22 to earnings per diluted share both of which are included in guidance. We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on state's increasing minimum wages and general average hourly rate increases. We have budgeted higher import freight cost and diesel cost than a year ago. ","Net interest expense will be approximately $74 million in our 14-week Q4. For Q4, non-operating income will include $7.4 million or $0.02 per share of asset for recognition of the completion of all the requirements for the forgettable promissory note issued by the State of Connecticut for the construction of our winter Connecticut distribution center in 2012. ","Our guidance does not include any share repurchases, we cannot predict future currency fluctuations, we\u2019ve not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36.2% for the fourth quarter and 34.7% for fiscal 2017. ","Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 238.1 million shares for Q4 and 237.7 million shares for the full year. For the fourth quarter, which includes one extra week, we are forecasting total sales to range from $6.32 billion to $6.43 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.80 to $1.89. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.7%.","For fiscal 2017, we\u2019re now forecasting total sales to range between $22.2 billion and $22.31 billion, compared to the company's previously expected range of $22.07 billion to $22.28 billion. The company now anticipates diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 will range between $4.64 and $4.73, which includes $53.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share of receivable impairment charges. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and 3.7% square footage growth, and inclusive of benefit of the 53rd week occurring in Q4 of fiscal 2017.","I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Kevin. We are very proud of the results that our teams delivered across our nearly 15,000 stores. Our merchants have teed up an exciting holiday experience at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Our supply chain teams have worked hard to deliver holiday goods with two major hurricanes affecting our normal business routines. And our store operators are now prepared for the biggest most exciting six weeks in our retail year. ","The retail environment ever changing provides both banners opportunities to take advantage of our customers\u2019 wants and needs and our management team has demonstrated over the years ability to be nimble and delivering results when challenged by the external environment. ","At each of our business segments we are focused to deliver on our customers\u2019 needs, our initiatives at both banners have helped to deliver on sales, margins, expense control and ultimately customer satisfaction. We are proud of what we have achieved and look forward to energy [ph] around the remaining major holidays ahead of us.","Before we turn the call over to Q&A I would like to share a few comments on the recent. As you all know late August throughout September states of Texas, Louisiana, Florida were hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Many of our store associates and customers were personally affected by these storms. Our efforts have been to help our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar associates and help the impacted communities through our partnership with the Red Cross. ","I want to give a special shot on and thanks to the thousands of associates at both Dollar Tree and our Family Dollar banners who worked tirelessly to have their stores open and serve their customers and preparation for and recovery from these devastating weather events. Across both banners we saw great team work, passion, dedication throughout our organization. ","My personal thanks for all of the efforts made in the stores, distribution centers and support centers and our many vendor partners that enabled us to get the impacted stores up and running in the hours and days after the storms impact.","Operator, we are now ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","So, can you speak to gross margins drivers at the Family Dollar banner? Obviously, a great quarter, but specifically can you talk to customer reception to the recent rollout of some of your private brands there. And just how would you rank forward gross margin drivers at FDL?","Gary Philbin","Well, I\u2019d it\u2019s a lot of the elements that we\u2019ve been talking about Matt from the beginning at core, some of it\u2019s the initial steps on synergy between the banners both on direct consumer items. The smart way is the save program that we\u2019ve implemented from the beginning has given the ability to drive business across each of those metrics. So, [with our dollar well] which certainly gives us some ability to drive higher margin items and we know how to do that from another banner. ","The compare and save on the private brands has really been, I would say just at the beginning stages of that now you\u2019re starting to see some of those brands out there in each of the categories. ","I mentioned some of them but I would say at this point the primary impact has been across consumables both in food and some of our household products. And where we\u2019re introducing those and getting critical mass, we\u2019re seeing additional penetration growth on the consumable side of the label change. ","I think it just gives our customers greater confidence in the packaging, marketing of the brands itself is more geared towards each of the categories that we operate in whether it\u2019s center of the store food or beverage or household products and it gives our customers I think the confidence to buy what are great values on the shelf compared to national brand. And this isn\u2019t either\/or we want to do both and so our opportunity to enhance the packaging has been a big piece of that. ","I would tell you there has also been just the nuts and bolts of us getting our pricing in line we\u2019re more competitive than two years ago. Our customers have greater confidence on the retails on the shelf, it still means that we have promotion on the items that we buy most often. And I would say our smart way to save element of our Family Dollar business also now has been well received and during the quarter we did start a new app, Family Dollar that gives our customers easy access to some of the great savings. ","And while we're at the beginning stages of getting our customer base there, what it allows us to do is really touch the customers who buy week-in and week-out most often and provide them savings on the items they buy most often. ","And so, it\u2019s the combination of all those things that have been driving margin and the continued emphasis on private label, driving discretionary, driving more imports, all those things that we\u2019ve talked about from day one are all the pieces that continue to drive progress at the Family Dollar level, both on sales and margin. ","Matthew Boss","That\u2019s great. And then just a follow up Gary and more higher level. How would you speak to the health at the low end? We seem to be seeing some laterals even outside of the Dollar store segments and judging by the trends that you\u2019re seeing in discretionary and I think you decided the best in the long time there. Are you starting to see any signs of some wallet openings? Just best way to characterize what you\u2019re seeing out there with your core customer and do you think it\u2019s sustainable? ","Gary Philbin","I think I would answer it two ways, Matt. I think on one side it\u2019s just us executing better. And that speaks to first of the month and getting our stores ready and in-store execution on all the store table stakes. So, at a very high level lets go get our fair share. And I think I\u2019ve mentioned before we have seen the increase of EBT benefits at Family Dollar even though across country they are down, small portion of our center type but still I think it speaks to just having the confidence when our customers come in at the most important time of the month, and that\u2019s at the beginning. ","I would say I think there\u2019s a customer that\u2019s still is under pressure. Rents continue to rise. Healthcare continues to rise. We have to be right on when they have money in their pocket we call it thrive and survive. So certainly, at the beginning of the month for our most needy customers we need to be ready in store with the basics. ","And at the end of month, given the right choices on the items that continue to give them a reason to come and shop at the end of the month when they are trying to stretch their budget. ","So, we got to stay focused on that customer who might have a little more jingle in their pocket but we have got to be grounded on everyday great retails and they got to have confidence that we are in stock with them in store. So, it\u2019s a combination of doing both those things.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will now move to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Gary, first question regarding the Dollar Tree segment. Can you discuss kind of comp sales benefits you\u2019re now getting from the re-banners at Family Dollar and Deals stores? And then further with operating margin for the Dollar Tree segment now at lifetime high, what kind of headwind for improvement remains given this is a discount and not a specialty retailer?","Gary Philbin","I am honoured to be considered as specialty retailer but I think it\u2019s two pieces I think are driving the results for us Dan. Upside on operating margin, we are very proud of the results. I would say it\u2019s driven right now because of just the ability for us to get smarter across each of our store clusters. Our merchants have done a terrific job on the values. I\u2019m not speaking to anything that\u2019s new to this business but our ability for our merchant teams to create value has always been the focus. That has to be worth more than the Dollar. And when we really hit it right we shared it across all of our stores and all customer types that come into the stores. And I think we\u2019re most proud of our ability to do that day-in day-out. But when you get to the holidays, that\u2019s really our time to shine. And so, there\u2019s always upside. We are never completely satisfied how we go through all the seasons. We see the ability to do a little bit more as we do the post mortems on each of the holidays and I think our opportunity to just continue do a little bit better as we drive our initiatives around -- some are around sales, some are around margin, some of course are always around SG&A, I think those are the buildings blocks for us to say how do we continue to drive incremental margin.","And give me a repeat on the first question Dan? The re-banner, yes.","Dan Wewer","The same-store sales benefit from the re-banners.","Gary Philbin","Because I think in the background of our comp store sales we\u2019ve had 300 Family Dollar re-bannered to Dollar Tree, we\u2019ve had over 200 deals get re-bannered really from 2015 and 2016 on both those, along the way we\u2019ve had 200 more Dollar Tree re-lows [ph]. And initially the impact is one of cannibalization and we\u2019re pleased with the comps we\u2019re getting now and it\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. Just getting store managers in the seats that go through our holiday seasons, because it is different and you have to know how it\u2019s going to flow from season-to-season. And so, our focus is more granted there, it also allowed our real estate teams to figure out on our pipeline, where should the next store go, because we were putting some stores in some geography that we already had plans for. ","So, we\u2019re pleased with what that\u2019s doing for us both on the Family Dollar side and deals side, it\u2019s fixed to both customers also by the way we had $11 or deal stores convert to Family Dollar which while not as big also are producing nice comps for us in the Family Dollar side. So, there is certainly both an engine for us right now as we go through comps in 2017. ","Dan Wewer","Also, I just had a really quick follow up for Kevin. You noted that your net debt EBITDA rate drops to 3.5 by year-end. Do you think that will be sufficient for the company to regain and investment grade rating? And if so what would be the benefits for your operations and financials from regaining the investment rating?","Kevin Wampler","Yeah. I mean from day one, the day we announced this acquisition we\u2019ve stated the fact that our goal is to get back to investment grade. And as always, we think about it from a flexibility standpoint as being investment grade gives us more flexibility in the financing world at the end of the day. ","Obviously, we\u2019re on that track, we obviously will work with the rating agencies, we\u2019ll provide updates to them [Audio Gap] whether they decide to upgrade or not, but I think we\u2019re doing our part of the equation so to speak. So, we\u2019ll continue for with that, but obviously the flexibility in the marketplace and the potential to see lower interest rates as investment grade as opposed to speculative [ph]. So, those are things we look at. ","Operator","Next, you\u2019ll hear from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. ","Alan Rifkin","Okay. Yes, I\u2019ll add my congratulations as well. On the Family Dollar side, certainly your gross margin gains are very admirable. But going forward, would you sacrifice some of the gross margins gains for a higher comp?","Gary Philbin","Well, we try to do both with everything we know going into the quarter and it\u2019s a combination of really understanding where we are in the marketplace and the competitive sets. We obviously like everyone else understand what\u2019s going on with pricing out in each of the markets that we operate in. We do have our own pricing strategy and competitive set on our promotional activity. We can always do more Alan and I would say even with the 1.5 that we produced, we certainly saw opportunities during the quarter that we could better. ","Everything that we know right now baked into the forecast the magic here is continuing to drive improvement across all those. It\u2019s not just comp store sales. It\u2019s not just gross margin improvement. It\u2019s not just SG&A. We talk about each of them and we get down to the details. So, when there\u2019s an opportunity for us to drive business, we try to take advantage of it. We try to back that up with how do deliver margin and SG&A. ","What I am pleased with the Family Dollar team, we\u2019ve really had a great growth on just the opportunity to really focus on what our Family Dollar customer and what they buy most often. Shows up in the ads of course but it\u2019s also showing up on our everyday retails on the shelf and it also shows up with our Family Dollar app. So, if it\u2019s a mom who buys diapers, we can deliver something above and beyond to them. And that speaks to us getting to know that Family Dollar customer better. ","We have more stores in urban America than anyone else. I think it speaks to us knowing our customer better than anyone else in the arenas that we compete in. And executing on the store level is the other side of that. And so, it\u2019s all those things that go into driving that comp combined with how do we deliver bottom -- and bottom-line Alan.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. Thank you very much. And a follow-up if I may, was there any benefit or impact both to revenues or operating margins with respect to the FLSA implementation or the SNAP implementation or inflation or deflation within commodity products?","Gary Philbin","Well the FLSA of course started off and then stopped last year in December so about this time last year we were talking about it and then it was pushed off to front burner. And SNAP benefits, I think across the country there's less households participating in it. But as I said before I think our opportunity at Family Dollar is getting our fair share of that and I am pleased that we\u2019ve been able to increase our penetration on the quarter year-over-year and that just speaks to our ability to do more around for some month again ready for it. ","And what was the third point? Your -- we\u2019re cycling some of the commodity I would say in our world you see some of it in diary, probably eggs is the biggest one right now where we\u2019ve had a boom bust cycle now on eggs going back and forth. But we\u2019re not a grocery store, we\u2019re not in the same arena as that. And so, it doesn\u2019t impact us as much as the folks in that sector. ","And again, for us going into this fourth quarter our opportunity is now for both banners, is around the discretionary side. But we\u2019ve really got some great values both on the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar side to drive our business for Q4. ","So, teams have done a nice job getting focused on that and delivering it into the stores and we got the five to six biggest weeks ahead of us now to deliver on that.","Operator","And we will now go to Chris Prykull with Goldman Sachs.","Chris Prykull","Just wanted to talk about the free cash flow generation of the business a little bit, particularly as we continue to progress further through the Family Dollar integration. How should we think about CapEx in fiscal \u201818 and beyond and how are you thinking about the timing for potential resumption of the share buyback program?","Kevin Wampler","Yeah, Chris as we look obviously we\u2019re rolling into our budget planning for 2018. Obviously, we\u2019ll give full view of guidance and CapEx next quarter, with the next quarter report. But I would tell you that CapEx we\u2019re going to continue to grow, we\u2019ll have some various from the store standpoint and infrastructure standpoint. So, I would not expect CapEx to be less than it is this year and in fact it\u2019s probably going to grow a little bit as we sit here today and again we\u2019ll give you more color on that as we go forward. ","But I think free cash flow is important, obviously it ties into everything we\u2019re doing as far as paying back our debt. And as we look at our longer-term once we get back to investment grade and that gives us stability to relook at our capital structure and consider other things that have been important pieces of the way to look to using cash in our past. So, as we go forward, I think we\u2019ll continue to generate significant free cash flow, puts us in a very good flexible place going forward. ","Chris Prykull","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then one follows up as you look sort of past the Family Dollar integration longer-term. How should we think about the core earnings growth algorithm for the business at that point in time? Is it fair to think about it in a similar fashion to what you all used to deliver before the acquisition?","Kevin Wampler","I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever had any algorithm that we\u2019ve referred to in regards I mean the main thing is we\u2019ve put our guidance together, we\u2019re always looking to improve our business. We\u2019re always looking to grow sales, grow comp sales, grow our store base, grows our profitability which has been one of the hallmarks of the Dollar Tree brand continuing to work to increase that operating margin. ","And again, each and every year provides a different set of circumstances and as we\u2019ve went through the year, we\u2019ve faced different things sometime there is inflation or deflation in the product cost that can be increases and decreases in fuel and obviously labour is a component that we continue grow forward and look at the that the labour markets. So, all those things play in to it and so our view point is -- our job as management is to come with a plan that will continue to improve our business as we go forward. But things that are really increasing, we have to determine ways that we can become more efficient, we have to improve our processes, we have to improve the way we go to market, everything we do, the way we supply our stores. So, all those are always in the back of our mind and we build initiatives around them to move our business forward each and every year. ","So, I don\u2019t know that there is an algorithm other than the expectations for growth and as we go forward that\u2019s the way we think about it. ","Gary Philbin","And Chris I would just add my color to it. I think both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar we are a company that\u2019s going to grow hundreds of stores each year when other retailers are potentially pulling back, I think it\u2019s still a great opportunity for us to deliver value and convenience in this value sector, which I think is the place to be for both of our brands and the initiatives that we have around driving productivity by store, by category will remain foundational elements of us. And we will be something different long-term than we are now with additional categories that come into the store and create excitement. We\u2019ve always done that over the years from what we\u2019re small boxes in the malls to something that delivers on both basics and at one\u2019s end needs for our customers at Dollar Tree and we\u2019re at the beginning stages of that at Family Dollar with renovations, improving productivity, changing the shopping experience. So those are just some of the elements that I think will continue to drive upward momentum on our sales as we look into future.","Operator","And we do have time for a few more questions. Next, we will go to Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Ciccarelli","So, we know you guys had to make some sizable investments as part of the acquisition of Family Dollar both in the CapEx side as well as the expense side. Can you help us better understand kind of where you stand today in that investment spending process and may be quantify how much more spending still needs to happen, now that we\u2019re two years through the integration process?","Kevin Wampler","Yes, Scott I think as we look at it we talked about synergies, we\u2019ve talked about the cost to achieve synergies and the fact that we have -- we originally said approximately $300 million of cost to achieve synergies and we\u2019ve said that there\u2019s been over 50% of those costs have been CapEx, and a lot of that\u2019s related to the re-bannering of stores as well as the looking at systems and making changes and so forth. So, most of that is behind us. There will be some continued systems work as we go forward. ","The other big area that we continue to invest in is in regards to deferred maintenance especially within the red banner. And I think practically every quarter since the close of the acquisition you\u2019ve probably heard me say that one of the SG&A items at the top is repairs and maintenance. We continue to look at that. We still believe we have things that we want to continue to do to improve the Family Dollar stores from a repair and maintenance standpoint. ","Again, it\u2019s part of our table stakes that goes hand-in-hand. So, there will be continued investment but I don\u2019t -- it's always built into our guidance as we go forward for those expenses. And from a capital side, that would be within our guidance as well. ","So, I don\u2019t see it as being out of the normal, it's somewhat part of the run rate as we go forward. And I don\u2019t see a big blip on the go forward map so to speak, it's going to be surprise investment there. But there will be continued investment going forward.","Scott Ciccarelli","Okay. And what else would be kind of follow-on to that, operating expense that may still need to kind of flow through the P&L. Is there anything notable in there?","Kevin Wampler","Other things there could be some consulting dollars as we -- especially as we work through some of the system type things, sometimes we need to bring in some consulting help and those type of initiatives. So that\u2019s probably one of the main areas.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","It\u2019s on the remodel Family Dollar stores. What sort of productivity and profit lift are you seeing in the remodels that you have done initially?","Gary Philbin","Hey Michael it\u2019s Gary. We are pleased with that. We have not called it out as the circle continues to see grow and the number of stores we are going to affect up to 350 this year. I think the primary elements of the revalue or renovation that you heard me talk about, really speak to what the customers sees and part of that is just adjacencies of product, it\u2019s introducing more dollar well, it\u2019s adding some more items that they need especially in frozen food assortment, it\u2019s similar to surprise and delight of the power alley and well. It\u2019s more Dollar items throughout the store. And it\u2019s really giving our customers. I think a fantastic shopping experience and one that invites them to spend more in the store just because some of the items and one of the basics we have diapers, next to our kids' new born infant toddler where and the synergy of having a mom shop both of those is obvious. ","So, those are some of the things that store ought to deliver for us. As we continue to do more renovations, we\u2019re looking at some of the older stores in the fleet what we would call traditional stores and opportunity to bring them up to a brand standard and the expectation is that we can drive a pay back on this that meets all of our internal requirements on it. So, we like where we\u2019re at, we\u2019re going to plan to do the remaining of the stores in January to get it up to 350 for this year and we\u2019re going to certainly be doing hundreds of them next year to continue to drive the progress forward. So, more to come on it, we like what we see and it\u2019s a great opportunity for our customers to see really a new Family Dollar inside the four walls and invite them in to see a new shopping experience.","Michael Lasser","And as part of the remodels that you\u2019re doing you\u2019re adding more coolers and freezers, so presumably that's adding more customer trips and more sales volume is that right?","Gary Philbin","We like that, now not every store has exactly the same number of coolers and freezers and some get more than others, some have the right configuration, but you\u2019re exactly right especially in frozen food, our customer can store that in a two-by-three section at home of the refrigerator and freezer. It does invite more trips, it also I think gives them some of the basics that they need every day so it does we think drive traffic, we certainly saw it on the Dollar Tree side as our expanded frozen food years ago and continue to. And I think it speaks to category that our customer needs.","Michael Lasser","And then my follow up question is on the fourth quarter guidance. The 3.3% out of price comp in 3Q presumably under your nomenclature that\u2019s a low to mid-single-digit comp and that you\u2019re guiding for low single-digit comp in 4Q. Is there any reason to believe why the business should flow in 4Q versus 3Q?","Kevin Wampler","Michael, out of store put our guidance together what the other thing we know we\u2019re obviously early in the quarter we\u2019re three weeks in of a 14-week quarter, we got the six biggest weeks ahead of us. It doesn\u2019t mean we believe it\u2019s going to flow and we\u2019re very encouraged with our business in the third quarter was very encouraging. We feel very good about our inventory position where we\u2019re at and the flow of our goods as we look at the fourth quarter. So, like those are all very, very encouraging things. And we still got to go out and execute it at the end of the day and so we put what we know and what we believe in and we can hit, we hope to hit basically in the fourth quarter and then go forward from there. And obviously our goal is always to overachieve and that\u2019s what we work to do.","Gary Philbin","And I would just add the -- against that backdrop is really just the merchandise energy because when it comes right down to it, we\u2019ve got to get the right product to the right stores. But it also has to speak to the values that our customers will see in store. I always think what the merchant teams have done on both banners to drive the surprise and delight that you need sprinkled under both banners this time of the year is in place. And our store teams have worked hard. But to Kevin\u2019s point, we are ahead of even Thanksgiving this week. So, the most exciting six weeks in retail are in stores called Dollar Tree and Family Dollar I think. We are geared up and ready for it. And now we have to go execute.","Operator","And our next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","Could you just go back to Family Dollar for a minute here? So, the margins obviously were great. The progress on the top-line continues to be I guess I would characterize it as slow. Could you may be just provide a little bit more color on what you see as the key hurdles at this point to driving better comps there, the initiatives that you\u2019ve got to get over those hurdles and as we sort of think about progressing forward, not just Q4 but even into next year, what type of progress are you looking for internally to tell you that you\u2019re getting traction?","Gary Philbin","I am pleased with the results to say we can always do better as what we are all about so it\u2019s just part of our nature. Yes, we think we can do better. I would just call out though in Q3 we\u2019re living [ph] some of the echo from the boom of our clearance event back in Q3 of 2015 where we really cleared out the old merchandise at Family Dollar, drove lots of footsteps in sales in the quarter.","And so, it was may be a bit of aberration because of the spending we did to clean up the stores of old merchandise and resonated well with our customers. So, part of our comp last year was obviously going against that. So, year-over-year if you take a look at the two-year stack but then take a look at the three year, I think it might tell a better story, at least it does to us internally as we view the business. ","Nevertheless, we continue to work on at Family Dollar is driving a consistent comp top-line. We think it\u2019s there. But we think it\u2019s there by doing the things we\u2019ve been talking about. The tables stakes we\u2019ll continue to address what our customer sees primarily around in-stocks and customer service, getting ready for first of month, having the right item at the right time. All the things we have been doing on private label to drive the value of the items, the renovations. We need those. We\u2019ve got a couple hundred a day, we will get to 350 by year end. But addresses the stores that are I think to some degree our biggest opportunity to drive comps and most at risk if we don\u2019t just because then tend to be order and the adjacencies aren\u2019t right. ","So, it\u2019s never one thing. It\u2019s all these foundational elements that we\u2019ve been working on from the beginning that start to show up in comp store sales. That\u2019s what Duncan and team, merchants, operators at Family Dollar are focused on every day. And so, over the long-term this will be something that we continue to work on, address, and deliver top-line and bottom line results on. ","Operator","And we do have time for one final question. We will hear from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. I wanted to touch on a number of factors that are impacting margins both this past quarter and how we should think about it moving forward. If you can just detail a bit the pricing and promotional environment as well as payroll and labour cost. And then Kevin you also mentioned I believe incremental hurdles to be faced on diesel and freight. If you can just touch on each of those factors both in terms of third quarter and going forward. Thanks.","Gary Philbin","I\u2019d like Kevin take a start and I\u2019ll do the follow up Paul.","A \u2013Kevin Wampler","Yeah. So obviously if you look at labour we\u2019ve said from the beginning of the year that we expect that there to be pressure on our store labour and to no surprise given the various states that have now set their own specific minimum wages as well as just the general pressure from an increase in average hourly rate probably the we\u2019re seeing the largest increase probably since pre-the great recession basically at this point in time. But, so obviously we expected that and built that into our model as we entered the year. And again, we look at the labour markets and we are competitive and the individual market demand we look at them in that direction. And feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at overall and but again it will continue to be a pressure as we go forward and it\u2019s built into our guidance. ","Obviously, diesel is roughly I want to say about $0.50 higher per gallon than it was a year ago at this point in time. I think for the third quarter itself it was closer to maybe a $0.30 to $0.40 average higher, so there is a little bit of headwind there as well as from ocean freight as we talked about with the contract started in May, as freight rates came up a little bit. So, that\u2019s been in our guidance all the year as we go forward, we\u2019ll have to see how we look at that one as we go into the next year that may continue to be a little bit of put pressure there as there have been some additional consolidation in the ocean freight carriers and there has been even some consolidation obviously in domestic freight carriers as well. So, we\u2019ll continue to look at those things. ","But again, we always look at on Paul as things that we know we see them coming, we have to react accordingly and determine how we can offset them in some way shape or form whether it\u2019s a changes in how we operate or finding other line items where we can offset those costs increases if they happen to be cost increases. So that hasn\u2019t changed as part of our DNA so where we think about things as we go forward. But again, all the things are built into our guidance as we go forward.","Gary Philbin","And I would just add as we enter the holiday season here, really on the pricing and promotional piece, I\u2019m pleased to where we are on our everyday values on the shelf across all of Smart Ways to Save that we offer our customer. I think our opportunity as we look forward into the holiday, we have some great promotional activity plan that Family Dollar at Dollar Tree, everything is a dollar, but the values are better than ever come and get it. But at Family Dollar, I think we\u2019re going to have a great holiday season based on what we see in the marketplace today. The values that we have out there, the assortment and offering we have out there I think is going to resonate with our customers. And I think we are geared up at Family Dollar to have a great fourth quarter. ","Dollar Tree, our seasonal, our store teams, our merchants have teed up everything to get us to this point in the season. It really sorts of kicks off this week with Thanksgiving and then on to Christmas. But we really feel good about where we are with inventory assortment and getting our stores propped. ","Paul Trussell","Thanks for the color. And then lastly. Just nine months into the year in terms of reported results, has there been any change at all to the ultimate opportunity to Family -- for Family Dollar\u2019s margins or any changes to the thought process around the pace of the expansion of ultimate time table to achieve the goals?","Gary Philbin","I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s changed. I think the elements that drive it are the things that we work on just from the standpoint of most everything we talked about. But I would say on the import side which is always one of the levers that has driven success at Dollar Tree and is an integral part of what we are doing at Family Dollar. You got to remember we bought Christmas [price] basically almost a year ago right after the Christmas holiday. And so, you take all your learnings, you go over, you find the next best values, you make your strategic reviews and go buy it. We\u2019ll learn something again this year. But that\u2019s an iterative process on each holiday and each buying trip we go over. That\u2019s the one that probably takes you a little bit longer to go to the seasons and have merchants in the seats to understand what\u2019s working the way they thought, where is the bigger opportunity, what needs to get fixed as you look forward.","The rest of it, we continue to do the blocking and tackling, that\u2019s finding opportunity to sell our customers private brand and drive great selling end caps in our stores that have new and exciting product out there. So, I think we like where we are at. We see the opportunity ahead of us and focused on building a plan for \u201818 that reflects all of that as well.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now turn the call back over the Mr. Guiler for any additional and closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Great. Thank you, Matt.

Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Reid","Thank you, Jim.  Good morning and welcome to the Dollar Tree conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.  Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in our business.  Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2012.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Bob?","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Tim.  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us.  This morning we announced our sales and earnings for the second quarter of 2012.  Comparable store sales increased 4.5%.  This increase was on top of a 4.7% comp in the second quarter last year and it was driven principally by increases in traffic.  Total sales for the quarter grew 10.5% to $1.705 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance.  Earnings for the second quarter were $0.51 per diluted share.  This represents a 30.8% increase over last year\u2019s $0.39 per share.  Operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, an increase of 80 basis points over the second quarter last year and another record quarter.  Just to note, this is our highest second quarter operating margin ever as a public company.  Operating income was $184.4 million, an increase of $30.9 million or 20.1% over last year, and net income rose 25.6% to $119.2 million.  ","For the first half of 2012 compared with last year, sales were 3.43 billion, an increase of 11%, and comp store sales increased 5.1%.  First half 2012 earnings per share were $1.01, an increase of 27.8% compared with $0.79 per share in the first half last year.  Operating income increased by $57.2 million, operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with the first half of 2011, and net income rose 20.1% to $235.3 million.","I\u2019m pleased with our performance in the second quarter.  Both top line sales and earnings exceeded the upper end of guidance.  Most importantly, we provided value to our customers and brought a record level of second quarter earnings to the bottom line.  I\u2019m particularly pleased by the productivity of our new stores.  Our location planning is improving.  The value of our merchandise has never been better, and customers are responding enthusiastically.","In our current economy with customer struggling to balance their family budgets in the face of persistently high unemployment and now unpredictable fuel prices, many people are finding Dollar Tree to be a destination for high value consumer products.  We plan to meet our customers\u2019 demand by providing these frequently purchased products consistently and at the highest value possible.  It\u2019s another reason to shop at Dollar Tree, and when customers are in the store shopping for the basics, we plan to give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high value and high margin variety merchandise.  Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree you still splurge \u2013 everything is still a dollar.","Sales increases in the second quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories with basic consumable categories growing at a slightly faster pace.  Our top performing categories included housewares and home products, food and beverages, healthcare supplies, and toys.  I\u2019m extremely pleased with the continued increase in inventory productivity.  Inventory turns increased once again in the second quarter, as they have consistently for the past seven years.","Our growth strategy remains consistent.  It is to open more stores, to open more productive stores, and to develop and expand new formats, new markets and new channels.  In regard to more stores, during the second quarter this year we opened 77 new stores and relocated and expanded another 21 stores.  Through the first half, we have added 187 new stores and expanded or relocated 65 stores.  Selling square footage increased 7.1% relative to the same time last year.  We ended the quarter with 4,523 stores and we\u2019re on track with our plan for the full year 2012, which includes 315 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions, for a total of 390 projects across the U.S. and Canada.","In order to achieve consistent and profitable growth, our practice has been to add infrastructure and distribution capacity to support our growth ahead of the need.  In that regard, in July we broke ground on DC10, a new distribution in Windsor, Connecticut.  The new distribution center will be 1 million square feet.  It will be automated and highly efficient, providing capacity and cost-effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the northeast.  ","Along with opening new stores, we are focused with operating more productive stores.  Efforts have been concentrated on improved site selection, on right-sizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improved staffing, building the bench of qualified store management, and on opening new stores earlier in the year.  Average new store productivity has increased in each of the past six years, and the trend has continued through the second quarter of 2012.  ","Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues.  We installed freezers and coolers in 60 additional stores in the second quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated product at 2,403 stores.  We intend to roll this product out to 138 additional stores by year-end for a total of approximately 325 installations for the full year.  This important category serves the current needs of our customers and it drives traffic into our stores more frequently, which promotes incremental sales across all categories.  Our overall comp sales increase has been the result of growth in both needs-based consumer products and in higher margin discretionary variety merchandise.","The elements of our strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout our stores.  Seasonal presentations are more powerful, we\u2019re emphasizing more effective customer engagement, and we\u2019re working to drive more related sales through cross-merchandising.  In addition, we\u2019re expanding our assortments in many categories, including candy, stationery, health and beauty care, and home and household products, which was our fastest growing category in the second quarter.","Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and expansion of our geographic reach.  Our Deals format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential.  Deals delivers low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product.  By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deals, we\u2019re able to serve more customers with more products at value prices every day.","Customers are responding favorably to the strategy.  Customer awareness of the Deals brand is growing and the concept is building momentum.  In the second quarter, Deals had strong sales across a wide variety of merchandise categories.  To give you an idea, in May we broke our Summer Fun promotion, featuring the most relevant products for the summer season.  This included snacks, beverage, picnic supplies, as well as lawn and garden and patio products.  Deals outdoor products were very popular, led by lawn and garden, patio solar lights, decorations and lawn ornaments.  As temperatures soared sometimes into the triple digits, Deals\u2019 selection of summer hats, shoes, beach bags, beach towels, and summer toys sold particularly well, and our selection of electric fans were a great value and a big hit.","Overall in the second quarter, as in the past several quarters, traffic, average ticket and average unit retail all continued to increase at our Deals stores.  Comp store sales in our Deals stores have led the Company in recent quarters.  We\u2019re excited about the growth potential of Deals and particularly the opportunity that it provides to grow profitably in the higher cost of operation urban markets.  We ended the quarter with a total of 190 Deals stores.","Our Canadian integration and expansion continues.  As a reminder, we initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010.  Our primary focus in the first year in 2011 was to install and train Dollar Tree retail systems, to integrate processes, to align merchandise assortments and store teams, and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market.  This year, we\u2019re working to make use of the new systems, build history, and to leverage the investment.  Our focus is on developing efficiency in store operations, improving the flow of product to the stores, and the continued building and training of our store teams.  We\u2019re working very hard to increase the service level and in-stock positions of basic products while improving the shopping experience through a more powerful seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. ","Our goal over time is to be the largest retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we\u2019ve done in the U.S. at the $1 price.  We began the year with a plan to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand, and we will likely exceed this plan by 10 or 12 stores.  We opened 10 stores in the second quarter, 18 stores year-to-date, and we ended the quarter with 117 Canadian stores.","We have a lot of room to grow at Dollar Tree.  As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores.  This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deals format.","Dollar Tree Direct, our online business, continues to expand and develop.  DTD is providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores.  Dollar Tree Direct now offers more than 2,500 items online.  Traffic exceeded 4 million visitors in the second quarter, a 14% increase over the second quarter last year.  Of special note, we now have more than half a million friends on Facebook and more than 1 million customers logged on via their smartphones.  We\u2019re gaining customers every quarter and I\u2019m pleased with the progress.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance.","Kevin Wampler","Thanks Bob.  As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 30.8% in the second quarter to $0.51.  The increase resulted from our strong sales and expense controls which drove an 80 basis point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the second quarter last year.  Our gross profit margin was 35.2% during the second quarter, consistent with the 35.2% reported in the second quarter last year.  Several factors contributed to this performance.","We leveraged occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 4.5% comp store sales growth.  Second, IMU on many categories increased in the second quarter, reflecting continued improvements in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model.  Third, we achieved small reductions in shrink and markdowns compared with the second quarter of 2011.  These factors were offset principally by two items:  our product mix continued to shift in the second quarter but to a lesser degree than we have seen in several years.  Basic consumable products increased by 45 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter.  Also we have previously disclosed, in the second quarter last year we recorded a favorable inventory adjustment related to immaterial corrections to prior periods, which benefited gross profit last year.  ","SG&A expenses were 24.4% of sales for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement from the second quarter last year.  Payroll related expenses declined by 60 basis points, driven by leverage on payroll and lower expenses for stock compensation, incentive compensation, and workers\u2019 compensation.  Health insurance benefit expenses increased relative to the second quarter last year.  Operating expenses declined by about 20 basis points due to lower costs for utilities, repairs and maintenance, as well as leverage on sales.  ","Operating income increased $31 million compared to the second quarter last year.  Our operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, an 80 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter last year.  ","The tax rate for the quarter was 35% compared to 37.7% in the second quarter last year.  The lower rate is primarily a result of statute expirations in the settlement of a state tax audit.  The lower tax rate represented about a $0.025 per share benefit to second quarter earnings per share.","Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, our cash and investments at quarter end totaled $379.8 million versus $545.4 million at the end of the second quarter 2011.  Cash net of debt was $115.5 million at the end of the second quarter.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of Dollar Tree stock for $80.9 million.  At quarter end, we had $1.1 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization.  The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter was 232.6 million.","We continue to view share repurchase as good use of capital.  Over the past four quarters, we have invested $634.6 million for share repurchase.  We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur.","Also during the second quarter, we entered into a new $750 million unsecured credit agreement.  The previous $550 million credit agreement was terminated concurrent with entering into the new agreement.  The Company has drawn $250 million under the new revolving credit line.  This amount is reflected as long-term debt on the balance sheet.","Our consolidated inventory at quarter-end was 9.6% greater than it was at the same time last year.  Selling square footage increased 7.1%.  Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 2.3%.  The increase reflects an increase in goods on the water and in the distribution centers at the end of the second quarter as we continue to execute our smoothing of inventory flow throughout our logistics network.  Inventory turns increased in the second quarter and we expect this trend to continue for the full year 2012, as it has for the past seven years.  ","Capital expenditures were $74.7 million in the second quarter of 2012 versus $63 million in the second quarter last year.  For the full year, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of 320 to $330 million.  Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT system enhancements, and approximately $70 million towards a new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut.  The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $100 million.","Depreciation and amortization was $43 million compared to $39.6 million in the second quarter last year.  We expect depreciation expense of 170 to $180 million for the year.","Our guidance for the second half of 2012 includes several assumptions:  first, Halloween shifts two days deeper into the fourth quarter this year from the first Monday of the quarter last year to the first Wednesday this year.  We believe that this will shift approximately $5 million of sales from the third quarter into the fourth quarter compared to last year.  Second, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks.  This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million in incremental sales and $0.07 to $0.08 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year.  ","Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 38.2% for the third quarter and 37.6% for the full year.  Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 231.7 million shares for the third quarter and 232.2 million shares for the full year.  As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.","With this in mind, for the third quarter of 2012 we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.71 billion to $1.75 billion based on a low to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.51, an increase of 9.3% to 18.6%.  ","For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are raising our guidance.  We are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.36 billion to $7.45 billion based on a low to mid-single digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.2% square footage growth.  Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.54, representing an increase of between 21.9% and 26.4%, over our record earnings per share of $2.01 in fiscal 2011; and it does take into account the 53rd week that will be included in the fourth quarter of 2012.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks Kevin.  As I said in May at our last call, we entered this year with goals to drive more customer traffic, to thrill our customers with surprising values on merchandise they need and want, to improve our shopping experience, and to build market share.  We continue to make progress toward accomplishing all of these goals.  First half sales grew 11% to a record $3.43 billion.  Comp store sales increased 5.1% on top of a 5.9% comp last year, driven by increased customer traffic.  Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever.  Our turns increased again in the first half, and we entered third quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand.","Our operating margin increased by 70 basis points to 10.9%, the all-time highest first half operating margin in our history.  Net income grew 20.1% to $235.3 million, and earnings per share increased by 27.8% to $1.01 per share.  In addition, we opened 187 new stores across the U.S. and Canada, and so far the productivity of the new store class has been performing ahead of last year.  ","Looking forward, I believe that we\u2019re positioned to do even better in the future.  The focus is on our customer and our stores and our product.  They are strategically located to serve middle America, they are bright, convenient and fun to shop.  Our business model is powerful and flexible \u2013 we can adapt to a changing environment.  This has been tested by time and validated over the Company\u2019s 26-year history.  Our balanced mix of high-value consumer basics and our unique assortment of fun and compelling discretionary product positions us to be relevant to customers in all economic circumstances.  Dollar Tree has a solid and scalable infrastructure that we\u2019re expanding and leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain logistics, more productive store and crisper execution overall.  The Deals brand is gaining traction.  Both traffic and average ticket are growing.  Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach, and we are working diligently to build and expand our Canadian business.  ","We have plenty of opportunities to grow our business, a vision of where we want to go, and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen.  We continue to generate substantial free cash and we use our capital for the long-term benefit of shareholders.  ","It\u2019s real exciting to be at Dollar Tree.  We had a great first half.  Our merchandise values are better than ever, and our future has never been brighter.  As we enter the third quarter, our shelves are full of the right product, our stockrooms are in great shape, and our values have never been higher.","We are now ready for your questions.  So that we can accommodate as many callers as time permits, we ask that you limit your questions to two.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","And we\u2019ll take our first question from Matt Boss with JP Morgan.","Matt Boss \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey, good morning.  So your SG&A flow-through in the quarter was the best we\u2019ve seen since 4Q of \u201908.  Can you speak to some of the investment spending around your Canadian operations and how we should think about expense control in the second half of the year, potential opportunities to look forward to?","Kevin Wampler","Yeah, Matt.  I would tell you in general as we look at the second quarter, you\u2019re right \u2013 I think our SG&A grew about 6.8%, and I would tell you that where we saw the biggest benefits, as we called out, was through the payroll line items.  As you well know, our biggest SG&A line item is our store payroll and our field payroll for those teams, and they did a very, very good job in the quarter of being efficient, and we leveraged those costs very, very well.  So as you think about it, I\u2019ve spoken a lot over the last couple of years about the idea of flowing inventory in a much more efficient manner through our system, and obviously this is one of the aspects of it in effecting labor.  So this year, we\u2019ll basically have about 300 million cases of product flow through our distribution centers which ultimately get to our stores.  The average store would get about 70,000 cases.  Obviously we have many stores that do well above average sales; they\u2019re handling a lot more cases.","So a lot of work has been done, as we\u2019ve spoken, in regards to how we\u2019re flowing these goods, so the logistics folks\u2014you know, it starts with the buy and how it then flows through the distribution centers and then to the stores, and we do believe that we\u2019re making gains there.  At the same time, we do believe there is more to be gained in the long run as we continue to go down that path.","As far as Canadian SG&A, obviously we did a lot of work last year with infrastructure, and so we haven\u2019t seen the same leverage there and we don\u2019t necessarily expect to see the same leverage in the near term as we continue to build out our teams.  The other thing we have going on up there is relaying these stores that are in the Ontario province, relaying them and re-bannering them as Dollar Tree stores, so there is extra labor that goes into that.  So we have not\u2014at this point, we have not seen that.  Obviously longer term we do believe that there will be benefits from the infrastructure from the changes that we\u2019re making, as well as productivity in the stores.","Matt Boss \u2013 JP Morgan","Great.  And second, can you talk to the monthly cadence of comps in the quarter \u2013 any surprises in the quarter from a category perspective, and then any thoughts on traffic trends thus far in August?","Bob Sasser","Well the quarter was fairly consistent.  It started off May was a little better than June, and July sort of rebounded back from May a little bit, so there was that sort of a cadence in the quarter.  But throughout the quarter, it was consistent with our expectations.  Matt, we don\u2019t talk about upcoming quarters, so I can\u2019t give you any remarks on that; but cadence throughout second quarter was as I expected and really no surprises there.","Matt Boss \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, great.  Thanks.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Meredith Adler from Barclays.  ","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays","Hey, thanks very much.  I would like to kind of follow up on the question about sales.  You said it was in line with expectations.  Do you think that the weather had any impact at all on your sales?  Could you look at geographic data and say that in places where the weather was normally hot or not so hot, sales were good; and then there was any kind of a slowdown in places like the midwest or the northeast where it was particularly hot?","Bob Sasser","Meredith, I really can\u2019t say that there\u2019s any correlation there to weather, really.  We saw no real impact by the weather.  If you look at the regions and the areas of the country, our best comp growth was in the mid-Atlantic and in the midwest, but it was really overall across the country a fairly tight range.  You always have as you look closer with a microscope, you always have a little market here and a little market there that either overachieves or underachieves, and we saw some of that; but that\u2019s the usual.","Overall, it was fairly consistent with expectations, with our expectations this quarter, whether you look at it geographically or by period of time.  It was really hot; I don\u2019t know that that had any\u2014you know, I can\u2019t tell you that I can see in the numbers where that had any effect.  In our Deals stores, we sold a lot of fans.  We sold a lot of water.  We sold a lot of things that you need when it\u2019s really hot, so it may have even helped us in some places.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays","Great.  And then you made a comment in your first prepared remarks \u2013 I\u2019m not sure I can quote you exactly, but something about how important basics are to the consumers and that you want to have them there for them when they want them.  I didn\u2019t know whether that implied some change in sort of philosophy about replenishment of more categories, I won\u2019t say plan-o-gramming but maybe more consistency in the offering.","Bob Sasser","Meredith, I\u2019ll tell you what I was speaking to.  We get a lot of questions about the penetration of consumer products to our overall mix, and of course consumer products are really important to our traffic because customers buy them more frequently.  Everybody needs them, they shop more frequently for them, so it helps increase our traffic, but there\u2019s always a balance.  They\u2019re a little lower margin.  Higher turns, little bit lower margin, so there\u2019s always a balance between that and what we call our variety merchandise, which is the fun and the seasonal and all the things that the surprising values that you find at Dollar Tree.  Discretionary product, higher margin-type product.  So we\u2019re always talking about the balance, and if you look at the past several quarters, there\u2019s been an increase in the consumer products as a percent of our total driven by the down economy, the dire straits that a lot of people are in with high unemployment, with uncertainty on fuel prices, with any uncertainty that there is out there. ","So that was really all I was speaking to.  We\u2019re not really changing our distribution strategy, just speaking to the fact that we still see continued penetration from the consumer products driven by the customers\u2019 need, and our intent is to continue to serve our customers.  Sometimes I\u2019m asked questions about, well, how far do you think that is?  Well, we\u2019re really following our customers\u2019 lead, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that.","If you look at second quarter, it was really a very good balance.  I think the penetration of consumer products increased about 45 basis points, which gave us a little bit, about a 22 basis point headwind on gross profit during the quarter, and we still ended up with gross profit flat to last year.  So we\u2019re really pleased with the performance in that regard.  That\u2019s what I was speaking to that was the mix.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Wewer from Raymond James.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Hey, good morning Bob.","Bob Sasser","Good morning.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","So over the last five or seven years, there\u2019s always been questions about inflationary pressures in China and whether or not Dollar Tree would be able to maintain its gross margin rate, given your adherence to a single price point strategy, and obviously the Company\u2019s performance has been stellar but now we\u2019re looking at a little bit of a different environment where the inflationary pressures in China may be abating.  Do you think that there is an opportunity for Dollar Tree\u2019s initial markups, which have been improving, to perhaps increase at an accelerating rate because of this change?","Bob Sasser","You know, as I\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s all about the mix.  If you look at our gross profit\u2014I\u2019ll one-up you, here.  Go look at the last 10 years, and our gross profit has been in a really tight range.  The high was a 36.4; the low in the past 10 years was 34.2, and Q2 of this year was 35.2.  So we always manage within a very tight range, and a lot of that\u2014all of that, much of that is due to our flexible strategy.  We\u2019ve always said we\u2019re in charge, we\u2019re in control of our gross margin, and I will tell you that we still are.  As prices go up, we change the product, not the retail price.  We strive to get the best cost, the best value for the customer at a dollar and at a price that fits our gross margin.  And as prices can\u2014maybe pressure is a little bit down, we tend to invest more in the product.  We get better product for the same dollar price because we\u2019re still striving to get the customer the most value for one dollar and at a cost that fits our budget.","So that\u2019s our strategy.  It has been, it\u2019s worked for us, that\u2019s why we\u2019re still in that tight range there over the past 10 years, and I expect we\u2019ll continue to be there.  There may be categories or items or times where we on judgment decide to invest more or less in the product, but I wouldn\u2019t expect you to see that in the numbers.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","And just as a follow-up question, the last few quarters Deals\u2019 same store sales have bee exceeding Dollar Tree.  You\u2019ve told in the past that profitability for Deals is still not at the same level, but given the higher sales productivity, could you update us as to\u2014you know, in some qualitative terms how much of a gap exists in either operating margin or return on capital, and with the better sales trends at Deals, are you now incentivized to grow that brand at a faster rate than you have been?","Bob Sasser","","Yeah, that\u2019s a fair question.  You know, we don\u2019t break it out and I can\u2019t give you any solid metrics there.  I can tell you just speaking about it anecdotally, I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in Deals.  Our customers are accepting it more and more and recognizing the value that Deals provides.  It lags in profitability as a percent, but our top line is growing and I think there\u2019s still a huge opportunity to drive the top line to higher levels, at the same time managing our expenses a little better.  We\u2019re still in the try\u2014you know, test and learn kind of mode, and we still will build a store and it will be really great, but then we\u2019ll change it and we\u2019ll turn it upside down sometimes and redo it.  ","So there\u2019s still things we\u2019re looking at.  We know that we can get more productive, more efficient on our sales floor.  We know we can drive efficiencies in the way we deliver our product, the way we display our product.  We know that we can drive efficiencies and drive better cost advantage on the items that we\u2019re buying as we get larger, as the Deals chain grows and the volume grows and our leverage on the buy gets better.  ","So I\u2019m very excited about Deals.  We intend to keep growing Deals.  Mainly we\u2019re using right now in the higher cost of operation urban market because we do believe we can drive more top line sales in our Deals store.  So good question.  I can\u2019t give you the\u2014I can\u2019t break out the numbers because we don\u2019t.  I will just share with you the great enthusiasm that we have for Deals here, that I particularly have for Deals.  Deals is going to be a big part of our business as we go through time here at Dollar Tree, and I\u2019m very excited about it.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, thank you.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Bob, I know you were talking about some of the cadence and the mix, et cetera, already; but I guess we\u2019ve seen a pretty steady shift towards consumables over the last many, many quarters here.  Are you surprised, given some of the mixed signals we\u2019ve seen in the retail economy, the mix didn\u2019t shift even more towards consumables, in fact it went the other way a little bit?","Bob Sasser","Well frankly, we\u2019ve been really working hard to make the mix go the other way, not by lowering our sales of the consumer products but by taking advantage of the traffic that its creating.  As you know, our traffic this year really is largely\u2014our increases are largely the result of increases in traffic, so we\u2019re trying.  We have a lot of initiatives in place to use that traffic to drive sales of the variety merchandise.  So when you come into Dollar Tree or Deals to buy your cleaning supplies or your snacks or your HBC, your toothbrushes, toothpaste, whatever, we\u2019re really working hard to challenge our customers with the new and exciting.  The seasonal offering that we have\u2014I tell our people, like the leaves on the trees changing from season to season, and the ever-changing mix of colors and excitement at the front of our stores.  We\u2019re talking really a lot about the front of our stores as a way to sell more on impulse and related sales and drive items, and the item of the month and all of those things up at the front of our stores, especially are the variety merchandise.  Higher margin, it\u2019s a surprising value, it\u2019s part of the fun shopping experience that we create at Dollar Tree, so it\u2019s really a big deal to us.","So when you say, am I surprised by it?  Well, I\u2019m really\u2014I\u2019m happy.  Now we\u2019re going to do more on both, by the way.  We want to drive all of our business, but the strategy is to use the consumer basics for traffic and the variety merchandise for shopping experience and fun and margin.  That\u2019s what you saw in the second quarter \u2013 the consumer basics increased penetration still by 45 basis points, but that\u2019s a smaller increase than we\u2019ve seen in some recent quarters.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","All right, that\u2019s very helpful.  I know you also talked about the weather a bit.  Just given some of Wal-Mart\u2019s comments this morning with paycheck cycle, et cetera, can you provide us any other color, maybe what you\u2019re seeing from your average consumer?","Bob Sasser","Well you know, I haven\u2019t had a chance to see their comments in detail \u2013 I\u2019ll take a look after the call.  But we do see, as we have for the last several years, an increase in consumer spending around the paycheck cycle, around the first of the month.  It\u2019s something that has become part of our strategy around here, to be in stock and in business and really be ready for our customers around the paycheck cycle.  I\u2019m not sure what Wal-Mart said, but that continues.  That is a trend that we see continuing here.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great.  Thanks guys.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Keith from Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hey, good morning.  Thank you.  I was wondering if you guys could actually quantify the impact that you saw with the debit and credit card penetration within your sales mix.","Kevin Wampler","Yeah.  As it relates to debit and credit penetration, you know, it is continuing to increase year-over-year.  I want to say it\u2019s up about a point and a half to this point.  It\u2019s approaching 37, 38% of the overall tender mix, and it\u2019s still broken out that debit is about two-thirds of that overall debit-credit mix.  So that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing, and it continues to grow.  And the interesting thing is where we\u2019re seeing the growth, it is in the debit.  If we look at our credit card business as a percentage, really pretty much flat.","Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thanks Kevin.  To follow up on that, then, if you\u2019re at 37, 38, it\u2019s been increasing steadily over the last couple of years.  I guess what would be maybe a long-term target you think you could reach?  And then as a follow-on to that, the traffic gains have been tremendous for your guys but the ticket has been a bit muted.  I guess I\u2019m surprised with the increased penetration that the ticket strength hasn\u2019t been stronger.","Kevin Wampler","Well, I think from a long-term goal perspective, I don\u2019t know that we have a goal.  I think the consumer is going to set that at the end of the day, and obviously the payment industry, people continue to move in that direction.  You know, the writing of checks has become old-school and now the next wave is paying with your smartphone somewhere down the road, and there\u2019s a lot of different people, different areas of retail working on that.  So I don\u2019t know that we believe that there\u2019s a number that it should be.  It\u2019s going to go wherever the consumer goes, but I would expect it to continue to increase slightly year-over-year as we go forward.  ","As far as it relates then to the ticket, again, obviously traffic is up.  We\u2019re generating a lot of traffic.  Maybe the average ticket isn\u2019t going up significantly, but it has gone up a little bit last year and it\u2019s been up just slightly this year.  And again, as to what Bob had spoken about, there\u2019s a lot of focus from our group internally to look at impulse items in the front end of our stores and how do you get that person to put one more item in their basket, because obviously our comp is all driven off units.  There is no price inflation built into our comp, so it\u2019s all about getting people to pick up one more item and putting it in the basket.  ","But at this point in time, we\u2019re obviously going to take advantage of the traffic, and if that\u2019s what they need under the current economic circumstances, if they\u2019re just going to come more frequently and spend a similar dollar amount, that\u2019s okay too.","Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, that\u2019s helpful feedback, and good luck this coming quarter.","Kevin Wampler","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Binder from Jefferies and Company.","Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, good morning.  I just had a question around the consumable mix.  As you pointed out, the shift was a little less severe.  I guess as I tour your stores, and it\u2019s been fairly consistent in terms of observations, at times there is some out of stock.  So I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s an opportunity there, or if there were any issues in the quarter where you thought you maybe missed an opportunity.  Again, not severe issues, but just sort of randomly see that now and again given the volumes you\u2019re doing.","Bob Sasser","Dan, there hasn\u2019t been any disruption in our supply chain that would indicate that.  We\u2019re always focused on providing a better level of in-stock and at the same time increasing our turns.  We don\u2019t want to get too much, you know; we don\u2019t want to fill up our stockrooms.  But there has really been nothing that would indicate that that\u2019s been a problem.  It could be it\u2019s a local problem with the store that you were in.  I\u2019d be happy to follow up \u2013 give me a call and tell me the store number, we\u2019ll take a look at it.  But we\u2019re always looking for improvements in that, and especially with the economy difficult and gasoline prices on the rise again.  We\u2019re really doubling down on our efforts to make sure we are in stock on those basics.  When our customers get to the store, I sure want them to be able to buy what they need and what they expect, and what they\u2019ve spent their money on coming to the store for.","Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies","And then my follow-up question was around the expanded categories you mentioned in your formal remarks.  It sounds like you\u2019re trying to capitalize on the growth areas in the store.  I\u2019m just curious \u2013 when should we start to see that in the stores, and maybe if you could elaborate a little bit on how much you\u2019re growing the SKUs in those respective categories that you mentioned.","Bob Sasser","Yeah, it\u2019s a pretty broad strategy, Dan.  I think you\u2019ve seen some of it in the stores already.  If you looked in our HBC departments in the last several months, you\u2019ll see expanded patent medicines, you\u2019re going to see expanded SKUs throughout our HBC area, throughout our home area.  We\u2019re working real hard on our stationery business.  Right now, we\u2019ve got back to school going on, so you\u2019ve got a lot of expanded SKUs in that area, and we see stationery as an opportunity to grow tremendously as we go forward the rest of this year and into next year.","So I can\u2019t really quantify it.  There\u2019s a lot of new SKUs, there\u2019s a lot of new products and a lot of them are focused in those highly consumable categories.  ","Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Joseph Parkhill from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Parkhill \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.  I was just wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive environment as far as maybe California, when you see a Dollar General, Family Dollar moving in, if that\u2019s not impacting your stores because it\u2019s a different customer, or if you see any impact there.  And then maybe as far as back to school goes, how aggressive more full-priced players are being, if it\u2019s similar to last year, or any comments around that would be helpful.","Bob Sasser","Joe, good questions, but we\u2019re seeing no impact on the west coast from Dollar General\u2019s entry there.  I think they\u2019re entering with their market, but look \u2013 we\u2019re always watching them.  We watch all the competition.  We\u2019ve stayed more focus on what we\u2019re doing than what they\u2019re doing, though.  If you look at the stores where they\u2019ve opened up in California, there is no visible negative impact from their opening that we can see.  ","We have had them around for a long time, though.  You\u2019ve got to understand \u2013 they are a lot older than we are, and their model is just different.  It\u2019s different when everything is not a dollar; it\u2019s just a different model, it\u2019s a different customer, a different store layout and different pricing.  So we really stay focused on our position in the marketplace.  About half of our stores are within three miles of a Dollar General anyway.  About a quarter of our stores are within one mile of a Dollar General.  They are a much larger company than we are, so we see them all over the country.  California is no different.  Actually in California, we have a lot more stores than they do in California.  It\u2019s one of our more populous states in regard to stores, but we\u2019ve seen no impact from them.  ","We have great respect for them; we\u2019re just a different model.  When everything is a dollar, it\u2019s just different than they are, so we don\u2019t see the impact there.","You know, as far as looking at, again, the landscape of competition, we\u2019re really just staying focused on what we do best, and that\u2019s providing the most value for the dollar, giving the customer what they want, things they need, things they want, reacting to the current opportunities.  We don\u2019t\u2014you know, we\u2019re not stuck on any one item or any one assortment.  We don\u2019t set plan-o-grams and that gives us the ability to react quickly when there\u2019s an opportunity to take advantage of a category or an item, and we try to do that as cost effectively as we possibly can.  So that\u2019s how we sort of defend our turf.","Joseph Parkhill \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","That\u2019s helpful, thank you.  And then just lastly, are you seeing any increase in looks at closeouts, given the current retail environment?  Is that helping your business at all, or everything\u2019s pretty similar to normal trends?","Bob Sasser","Yeah, it\u2019s about the same.  We always look for them and we\u2019re always trying to grow it, but the whole business grows so as a percent to sales it stays about the same.  We\u2019re not seeing any more closeouts than we normally see.  We stand ready to take advantage of all the good ones.  We probably turn down more than we buy because we are\u2014there are closeouts and then there\u2019s closeouts, so we try to take advantage.  And at the right price, all closeouts sort of turn to gold, but I can\u2019t tell you there\u2019s any increase in that given the economy.","Operator","At this time we have time for a couple more questions.  Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Chukumba from BB&T Capital Markets.","Anthony Chukumba \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning.  I had a couple questions related to Canada.  You mentioned in Ontario, I believe, rebranding some of the Dollar Giant stores to Dollar Tree.  I thought that was intriguing.  I mean, is that going to be the strategy going forward to operate both Dollar Giant and Dollar Tree stores in Canada, and when would you be actually opening just new Dollar Tree stores in Canada?","Bob Sasser","No.  Our plan is to re-brand all of them to Dollar Tree stores over time.  We\u2019re in the process now of opening new stores, filling the pipeline with new store opportunities, and at the same time we have a plan for over time remerchandising, relaying, re-staffing all of our Dollar Giant stores and re-branding them at that time to Dollar Tree.  So it\u2019s going to take us a while and we\u2019re starting in the east and we\u2019ll sort of end in the west; but the plan is to re-brand them all to Dollar Trees over time.","Anthony Chukumba \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And then you mentioned that you\u2019re going to exceed your guidance in terms of store openings.  I believe you said rather than 25% growth, it\u2019s going to be sort of 10 to 12 stores above that.  I was just wondering, what\u2019s sort of driving that?  Is it sort of you\u2019re just having better real estate opportunities, or you just feel a need to open more because the stores are just doing so well there?  I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color there.  Thanks.","Bob Sasser","It\u2019s opportunity.  We\u2019re opening more because we\u2019re finding the opportunity to open more, and we\u2019re excited about our opportunities in Canada so we\u2019re taking advantage of that as we can find the right deals.","Anthony Chukumba \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from David Mann, Johnson Rice.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","","Yes, thank you.  Good morning.  Bob, you normally talk about performance around the key holidays in a given quarter.  Can you just elaborate about that?","Bob Sasser","Well, we haven\u2019t had a real key holiday in this quarter \u2013 that\u2019s sort of the obvious, I guess, and in the past when I did talk about current quarter, you know, we\u2019re only a couple weeks into it and it was always about a key holiday.  So I really can\u2019t talk about\u2014I can\u2019t talk about this current quarter.  I\u2019ll be happy to answer questions about the first half.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","No, what I meant is whether it be the Mother\u2019s Day, July 4th\u2014","Bob Sasser","Oh.  Oh, I\u2019m sorry.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","In the second quarter.","Bob Sasser","No, I\u2019m sorry.  I thought you were talking about the current quarter.  I can\u2019t do that.  Yeah, I think the cadence around our sales\u2014again, a lot of times it\u2019s driven by those key holidays.  Mother\u2019s Day is one of our key holidays, and so as a result in May we had a really\u2014I would say that May was better than June.  Father\u2019s Day is not such a key holiday, as it turns out, even though we try to make it so.  But June is a little less of a key holiday than May, but then you\u2019ve got\u2014along with Dad, you\u2019ve got grads, and I think that\u2019s probably the bigger opportunity for us in June, and we had good results this year.  And I think as we go forward, we\u2019re going to really aim at that June time period to expand upon the graduation opportunities that we have.  And then as you cruise out of June and into July, you\u2019ve got the July 4th and clearance and all that goes with that.  ","So it is as we expected \u2013 Mother\u2019s Day was good, graduation was good.  Again, the cadence was pretty consistent with our expectations .","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","And in terms of the earlier question on IMU, can you just remind us or let us know how the IMU is looking from the last trip you did to overseas, and also in terms of inflation, are you starting to see increasing food inflation in the food side of your business, given commodity costs?","Bob Sasser","Sure, I\u2019ll give you the flavor on that.  Our merchants recently returned from Asia where they were placing orders for our need through the summer of next year, the summer of 2013.  And as I said earlier and as you\u2019ve heard me say frequently, we have a flexible model.  We don\u2019t set plan-o-grams, we\u2019re not stuck on any one item.  Our merchants go to market, whether it\u2019s in the U.S. or in China or wherever else in the world with really two goals \u2013 one, to give the most value to our customers for the dollar, and number two at the margin that we need for our financials.  They can always change an item, they can drop an item, they can add an item; but at the end of the day, we\u2019re always in control of our margin for that reason, and this trip was no different in that regard.  ","I would tell you just to characterize the pricing, overall the input\u2014the down low from the merchants upon return was that it was a terrific trip, one of the best environments that they\u2019ve seen in quite some time.  The non-food commodity prices were down, and in some cases significantly down over a year ago.  Cotton prices, for instance, were much more favorable.  The currency seems to be stable.  A year ago, there was a lot of anxiety and talk in the market on the part of Chinese vendors over more appreciation versus the U.S. dollar.  Not so much talk this year, so that\u2019s all settled down.  A lot of this is driven, of course, by the slower Chinese domestic growth in conjunction with slower worldwide demand, especially in Europe.  You hear a lot of talk in China about the slowdown in Europe that\u2019s put downward pressure on prices, and when you\u2019re Dollar Tree and you\u2019re open to buy and you\u2019re growing and you have cash, then that\u2019s a real advantage as we go to China.  ","Our assortments from the trip are compelling, fresh, a lot of new product purchases on this trip.  The value is the best ever, and I just can\u2019t wait to see it on the shelf.  So not much talk about inflation, I guess, on this trip.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","Very good, thank you.","Operator","And once again, we have time for a couple of questions.  Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Adrianne Shapira from Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Bob, I think in your prepared remarks, you described your operating margin, that you delivered an all-time high operating margin in the first half.  So my question is twofold \u2013 first, you\u2019ve done a great job setting new peaks, and I\u2019m just wondering philosophically how you think about, as a dollar store, is there a true peak as an operating margin?  And then second, as you\u2019re continuing to drive future margin expansion, as your comments earlier about gross margin being relatively consistent, are the levers just increasingly top line driven?  Thanks.","Bob Sasser","No, they\u2019re not, Adrianne, but\u2014good morning.  Thank you for the question, Adrianne.  They\u2019re not just top line driven.  I think as Kevin explained, I think, in some detail about the way we think about the flow of our product in our stores, the ability to operate more efficiently, the ability to take cost out of the supply chain, the ability to leverage that into more efficient store work group and lower our\u2014if you look at our payroll in the second quarter, huge improvements in payroll and our stores are still operating just very well.  We don\u2019t think we are doing things that negatively impact our customers.  As a matter o fact, that\u2019s our goal.  As we continue to make improvements, we\u2019re always looking at the things that don\u2019t touch the customer experience or that the customer doesn\u2019t really care about.  So we believe that there is a lot more room for improvement and efficiency in our operating margin, on a lot of lines on our operating margin, and of course there\u2019s still a lot of room for growth in the top line.  We talk about our new stores being more productive, and if you look back over the past 10 years, it\u2019s the highest so far this year.  These stores are opening up more productive than they have in 10 years, so I\u2019m really pleased with that.  I\u2019m pleased with the year-over-year comps that we\u2019re putting up.  Top line is still a big opportunity for us to continue to grow, but we\u2019re certainly not at the end of the line.  I mean, we see opportunity every day.","Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Great.  Bob, is there a long-term view in terms of what the right EBIT margin should be?","Kevin Wampler","You know, Adrianne, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a long-term view.  I would tell you this \u2013 obviously continual improvement is always our goal.  Obviously this year our guidance would tell you that we would get over a 12% operating margin, and obviously once we\u2019ve crossed 12 the next goal is 13 and so forth.  I mean, I think it\u2019s just\u2014the way we think about it is continuing to drive results, continuing to drive improvement throughout the business, and we do not see a cap in the near term future.  We do believe that there is plenty of room to continue to improve upon it.","Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Great.  And then just last question, Bob \u2013 you know, I think we heard a lot of questions asking, trying to dig into the sales; and it sounds like you were pleased with sales and it sounds like monthly intra-quarter pretty consistent; but if we step back, it does look like we saw on a two-year basis a deceleration.  So maybe just help us think about is that even a relevant metric, or was there anything that surprised you on the top line?","Bob Sasser","You know, Adrianne, it\u2019s a fair question, but as I look at this second quarter, I see a terrific performance \u2013 consistent, strong, growing, highly profitable.  We had solid growth on our top line \u2013 10.5%.  It tells me our stores are seen as more relevant than ever.  Our customer is responding favorably.  As an example, our new store productivity \u2013 I keep telling everybody\u2019s it\u2019s up right now, the highest in over 10 years.  The comp increase of 4.5% is consistent and in line with our guidance.  It\u2019s actually well above the midpoint and toward the top end of our guidance.  Last year, comps in the same quarter were 4.7%; this year, 4.5.  We continue to comp year-over-year, and our four-year comp\u2019s 22%-plus, and now we\u2019re comping on a much larger comp base than before so I see 4.5  We\u2019ve got leverage on our occupancy.  We\u2019ve got leverage on expenses.  Our gross profit percent was 35.2, flat to last year, which means we overcame some of the hurdles of the more consumer products that we\u2019re selling.  So gross profit was terrific.  Our business is well managed.  SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 80 basis points. ","So just a lot of good news in this quarter.  Inventory is up, productivity is up, our turns are up for year-over-year for seven years, you know, consistent, strong and growing.  That\u2019s what we always talk about here.  So yes, you\u2019ve got to look at the comps, but 4.5 is a good comp.  It\u2019s a consistent comp, and on this 4.5% comp we\u2019ve got a lot of leverage and we dropped just a whole lot to the bottom line, and the EPS increased over 30% - 30.8%.  ","So that\u2019s how I look at second quarter, and we still view Dollar Tree as having a lot of room to grow.  We have a growth strategy that includes more Dollar Tree stores.  We have Deals, which is gaining traction \u2013 another way to grow, a different model.  We\u2019ve got Dollar Tree Canada \u2013 new geographies, huge opportunities for growth in Canada.  We\u2019ve got to take some time, as we have in all acquisitions, to get them up to the productivity standards that we want, but we\u2019re doing that.  We\u2019re making the investments.  I\u2019m just really jazzed about where we\u2019re going with our Canadian stores and the opportunity for the future.","So that along with our direct business \u2013 you know, we\u2019ve got just a ton of opportunities as I look forward.","Operator","And moving on, we\u2019ll take our final question from Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning.  Just a question on your guidance \u2013 Kevin, it looks like you took in the top end of your sales range just a touch.  Can you just elaborate on why?","Kevin Wampler","You know, as much as I think, Chuck, it\u2019s a little bit of a shift in new stores and how\u2014you know, the timing of when they\u2019re opening up.  That\u2019s always a continual shifting matter.  A little bit of looking at, again, Canada and how they\u2019re opening up and productivity there, and so it\u2019s really at the end of the day, it\u2019s kind of a rounding difference when it comes right down to it, is kind of how it all fell out.","Charles Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.  And then when we look at the third quarter guidance, if I model in a 3 to 4% comp in order to get the $0.49 at the midpoint, it implies a flow-through of about 13%, which is a little bit lower than what you guys have done the past few quarters.  Can you hold my hand on exactly how you get there in terms of the complexion of the operating margin line, both gross and SG&A?","Kevin Wampler","Yeah, I think kind of at that midpoint, I think the way we\u2019ve kind of put it together is you might see just a little bit of pressure on gross profit year-over-year, but you\u2019d see some improvement on the SG&A, maybe not quite to the same extent that we have had recently; but again, obviously, it\u2019s guidance and we\u2019ll work very hard to try to do better than that at the end.","Operator","And at this time, that will conclude our question and answer session.  I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Tim Reid for any additional or closing remarks.","Tim Reid","Thanks Jim.

Please refer to the table in today\u2019s press release for a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impairment charge. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now I will turn the call over to Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Consolidated sales for the first quarter increased 4% to $5.29 billion. Same-store sales increased 0.5%. By segment, same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.5% and for the Family Dollar banner same-store sales decreased 1.2%. Our combined gross margin rate improved 20 basis points to 30.8%; consolidated operating income increased 5% to $439.7 million; and our year-over-year consolidated operating margin improved from 8.2% to 8.3%.","Total net income for the quarter was $232.1 million and our adjusted EPS of $0.98 met the high end of our range of guidance. Excluding the one-time tax planning benefit of $0.09 per share in the first quarter last year, our EPS grew by 10.1% from the adjusted $0.89 a year ago. I am extremely pleased with the first quarter performance for our Dollar Tree banner and with the continued progress in rebuilding the Family Dollar business. For the combined banners, total sales were near the mid-point of our range of guidance. Same-store sales were positive for our 37th consecutive quarter; consolidated gross margin and operating margin rates improved; SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed; and importantly, our adjusted EPS at the high-end of our range of guidance at $0.98 per diluted share.","Performance of the Dollar Tree banner continues to be strong and consistent. Same-store sales increased 2.5%; sales markdown, including freight expense, improved; trade declined and our sector leading operating margin grew 50 basis points to 12.3%. Our Dollar Tree merchants and operators continue to raise the bar for sales and profitability.","At Family Dollar, our customers are seeing cleaner stores, better product assortments, greater values, more consistent in-stocks and an elevated level of customer service. I\u2019m confident that each of these elements, over time, contributes to winning back repeat visits and share of wallet. But that\u2019s just the beginning. We are in the early stages with many of our key initiatives that are expected to bring continued improvement. Our remerchandising and renovation programs have just begun as we enter second quarter, and we\u2019re confident that our customers will be thrilled with merchandise synergy and excitement in our stores as these initiatives gain traction.","Our strategy is consistent and increasingly relevant, to deliver great values and convenience to our shoppers every day. With more than 6,400 Dollar Tree and more than 8,000 Family Dollar Stores, we have the unique opportunity and value retail to serve more customers through all types of markets. I believe we are in the most attractive sector in retail. Shoppers today are focused on value and convenience now more than ever, and that\u2019s exactly what Dollar Tree and Family Dollar Store provide, value and convenience.","Looking forward, our banners are positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business.","Our real estate and finance teams recently completed a rigorous analysis assessing the current store opportunity for each of our banners. As a result of their efforts and analysis, we\u2019re now confident in our opportunity to operate more than 10,000 Dollar Tree\u2019s and more than 15,000 Family Dollars across the United States. With a combined store count currently of approximately 14,200 stores in the U.S. we have many years of growth opportunity ahead.","In addition to opening more stores, we\u2019re keenly focused on increasing the productivity of all of our stores by leveraging our buying and operational synergies across banners, we have continued opportunity to increase sales, improve margin and manage expenses. With a keen focus on the customer, our goal is to maintain relevance in the market, offer extreme merchandise value and convenience, while operating stores with a full fun and friendly shopping experience. We plan to operate and grow both banners. At Dollar Tree, everything is a dollar. Family Dollar is your neighborhood discount store. We have the opportunity to serve customers with one or the other or both banners, depending on the market and customer demographics.","Our Dollar Tree Canada business continues to perform extremely well. Our merchant and store teams in Canada are doing a terrific job in managing their business. Their efforts in serving our Canadian customers are resulting in annual improvements and store productivity. Comp sales in our Canadian stores outpaced our Company average in the first quarter, driven by increases in both average ticket and customer count.","Leveraging the size and scale of Dollar Tree, our merchants continue to source higher value product, and our customers are finding broader and more exciting assortments and better values in Dollar Tree Canada stores. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of CAD1.25, just as we are in the United States at the $1 price point. We now operate 225 stores in Canada and believe we have an opportunity for 1,000 stores over time.","In addition to Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree Canada, our online business at Dollar Tree Direct is growing in size and performance. Doll Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, to drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores. While Dollar Tree Direct is a relatively small component when compared to our overall business, I continue to be very pleased with the year-over-year trend we are seeing in both traffic and sales. And we're seeing material increase in number of visits from mobile devices. We strive to run world-class stores and engage with our customers via conventional and digital marketing channels such as email Facebook, Pinterest, Craft Videos, Twitter and more. And I invite you to check us out at dollartree.com.","In April, we announced the location for Dollar Tree's 12th distribution center; it will be in Warrensburg, Missouri less than 60 miles Southeast of Kansas City. We plan to break grounds soon our new 1.2 million square foot facility, which will be operational by the end of second quarter 2018, and will support our continued store growth in the Midwest. This $110 million project will create approximately 375 jobs for Johnson County Missouri and surrounding communities within three years.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gary to provide more detail on our performance and our priorities. ","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone. We're pleased with our overall performance for the first quarter as we met the top end of our EPS guidance range. But we know we're certainly capable of doing better. Retail environment was dynamic and we saw a number of factors impact our business. These included delays in tax refunds and a shift in the timing of Easter. We continue to focus our efforts to achieve continuous improvement and drive our key business initiatives that are aligned to deliver better in-store shopping experience, top-line sales growth margin enhancements and effective cost management.","For the quarter, our enterprise same store sales increased by 0.5%. For the Dollar Tree banner, total sales in Q1 increased 7.9% to $2.57 billion and same store sales increased 2.5%. This was achieved through increases in comp transaction count and average tickets. Gross profit margin improved 50 basis points over Q1 last year and first quarter operating margin was 12.3%, an improvement of 50 basis points over last year's 11.8%.","Dollar Tree highlights for the quarter include sales in the top performing categories; snacks and beverage, candy, toys, seasonal products and healthcare products; sales performance was led by our consumables line of business in both consumables and discretionary comp positively for the quarter; as we expected April, which benefited from the Easter shift, was the strongest same-store sales of the quarter. ","Geographically, Dollar Tree same store sales growth was strongest in the Midwest, Northeast and Southwest and each of our operating zones delivered positive comps greater than 1%. The Dollar Tree business continues to be strong, consistent and growing. This represent our 37th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales and our operating margin continues to lead the value structure. Our first quarter performance continues to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers continue to shop for value and convenience.","For the Family Dollar banner, total sales increased 0.5% to $2.72 billion and same same-store sales decreased 1.2%. The first quarter represent our toughest prior year comp comparison we will face in 2017. On a two year stack basis, for the first quarter, comps were positive for the Family Dollar banner. Gross profit margin declined 30 basis points to 26.9% and operating margin was 4.6%. For Family Dollar, the highlights for the quarter include the sales in our top performing categories; snacks & beverage, health & beauty care and men\u2019s apparel. Our comp performance was driven by consumables, which comp positively slightly in the first quarter.","Timing of sales through the first quarter was impacted by various factors, including the material delays and the timing of tax rate funds, later Easter holiday and cycling of the staff benefit reductions from 2016. As a result, our comps by month varied from mid single-digit negative for February to mid single-digit positive for April.","Geographically, Family Dollar same-store sales growth for the quarter was relatively balanced with the west, Mid-Atlantic and mountain west zones being the strongest. Less than two years into our integration, we continue to make meaningful progress at Family Dollar around the key foundational elements that will drive performance. Our store table stakes focus on merchandizing value and the consolidation of shared services. Our efforts are focused towards our customer facing initiatives that the shoppers continue to give us credit for and we are working to improve and scale these across all 8,000 stores.","Our customers are seeing, clearing a better merchandize stores to have more compelling end cuts with pricing for everyday basics and holiday wants. And while we have more to do at Family Dollar, we are on the right track with our continued investment in the basics of our Family Dollar brand; these customer facing programs to drive and show value throughout the store, and tend to lead the momentum for our smart way to save marketing problem.","Our customers continue to respond to the value and savings across all of these elements; delivering value for our Family Dollar customers; our smart way to save messaging reflects the values and the execution of the merchandizing in our stores. This includes our EDLP pricing on everyday value; sale items that reflect most meaningful value on key items; Dollar well that drives the surprise and opening price points throughout the store; compare and save to shut out the excellent value of our private brands; price drop, great value on the items our customers buy most often; and smart coupons, the easy way to find additional savings.","We believe our customers are giving us credit across the store on our smart way to save and that gives us flexibility to drive value and convenience for our customers fill and shopping trip. In particular, our customers are continuing to respond and embrace smart coupons with more than 2.5 million customers enrolled since our Labor Day 2016 kick-off. For our regular shoppers, this program provides the no hassle shopping experience to national and Family Dollar exclusive offers.","We are seeing a measurable lift in the average ticket for the transactions where a smart coupon has been applied. For Family Dollar is a great way for us and our suppliers to reach a customer demographic that\u2019s uniquely served by Family Dollar, it enhance the delivery of our smart ways to save message.","Over the past 18 months, we\u2019ve invested a significant amount of time, test and learn effort to improve to our Family Dollar store layout. We are pleased with results we are seeing and now this is the format we will be utilizing for both our new stores and current renovation programs. We believe our customers will respond enthusiastically to this format as we roll down in months ahead. Elements for the layout, include; improved adjacencies and more productive end caps; expanded beverage and snack, including immediate consumption core near checkout; expanded assortment of food and coolers and freezers; and updated airfare assortment expanded the beverage in some stores; and efficient power alley to promote Dollar well items and affect through checkout process for the customers. Our first renovations have started in earnest in Q2 and we look forward to making progress in our target of 250 or more renovations this year. As performance becomes measurable and predictable, we have the ability and intention to ramp up accordingly.","Most new stores will now open with our assortment and adjacencies that reflects our latest thinking of our report. Another key element of driving improvement in the Family Dollar business is the development of our private brand program. We\u2019re in the process of moving away from family branded label such as Family Wellness, Family Gourmet and Family Chef with the intention to drive relevant brandings with new and improve packaging to refresh our assortment.","Some of these examples in our stores a day, you will see Homeline replacing Family Dollar brand in household products. You also see we\u2019re transitioning from our private brand candy assortment from Family Gourmet where you will now see candy Company. In the months ahead, we\u2019ll be transitioning labels in several other pipelines mainly on the consumables categories. These private brands are being developed to provide national brand comparable quality and terrific values to support the compare and save component of our smart ways to save program. Each of our brands will continue the 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. We look forward to providing you update on our progress in the quarters ahead on this important program.","While we have more to do, our team at Family Dollar is motivated and energized to be the best to delivering value to our shoppers that are unique in many ways and often underserved. Our store serve the customer that counts on us and responds and redeliver value convenience for quick trips in a small format and a Family Dollar shopping experience that backs up our promise of friendly service.","Now looking at real estate in the first quarter; we opened a total of 164 new stores, 89 Dollar Trees, 75 Family Dollars; we relocated or expanded 51 stores, 35 Dollar Trees, 16 Family Dollars; a total 215 projects during the first quarter; we also added freezers and coolers into 131 Dollar Tree stores during the first quarter; bringing our total Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 4,918. During the quarter, we closed 16 stores, five Dollar Trees and 11 Family Dollars; and we ended the first quarter with 14,482 stores, 6,444 were Dollar Tree, and 8,038 were Family Dollars.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our first quarter performance and our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Kevin?","Kevin Wampler","Thank you, Gary. I would like to remind everyone that our discussion, as previously noted, excludes the effect of the $0.13 per share receivable impairment charge, unless otherwise noted. Total sales for the first quarter grew 4% to $5.29 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 7.9% to $2.57 billion, and Family Dollar segment total sales increased 0.5% to $2.72 billion. Enterprise same-store sales increased 0.5%. Aiding currency fluctuations had minimal impact on our comps during the quarter.","On a segment basis, same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.5% and for the Family Dollar banner decreased 1.2%. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization from Family Dollar and deals stores that have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. We estimate the incremental cannibalization impact to the Dollar Tree banner comp to be approximately 30 basis points for the quarter.","Gross profit for the combined organization increased 4.7% to $1.63 billion for the first quarter 2017 compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin improved 20 basis points to 30.8% versus 30.6% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.9% for the first quarter, a 50 basis points improvement compared with the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Factors impacting the segment\u2019s gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs, favorable freight costs and lower shrink as a result of favorable inventory results; partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales, resulting primarily from our Cherokee County South Carolina DC opening in Q2 of last year.","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 26.9% during the first quarter compared with 27.2% in the comparable prior year period. The 30 basis point decrease was primarily due to higher markdown and shrink expense in the quarter, partially offset by improved merchandise costs.","Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter increased to 22.5% from 22.3% in the same quarter last year. Q1 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales was consistent when compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter at 22.6%. Higher store payroll costs and stock compensation were offset by lower health insurance costs, lower store supply and professional fees as a percentage of sales.","SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 22.3% compared to 22.1% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. The increase was a result of higher payroll costs, resulting from loss of leverage from the comp sales decrease and higher advertising costs, partially offset by lower depreciation costs and lower store repairs and maintenance costs.","Operating income for the Enterprise increased to $439.7 million compared with $418.7 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 8.3% for the quarter from 8.2% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 50 basis points to 12.3% when compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income for the Family Dollar segment decreased $13.7 million to $124.3 million, a 50 basis point decline as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter.","Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $75 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 36.1% compared to 29.8% of prior year's quarter. Prior year's quarter included a one-time benefit related to the state tax planning. For the first quarter, company has net income of $232.1 million or $0.89 per share compared to the reported net income of $232.7 million or $0.98 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.","Prior year included $0.09 one-time benefit to the EPS and a lower than anticipated tax rate as previously noted. Excluding the $0.09 one-time benefit for the prior year quarter diluted earnings per share of improved 10.1% for the adjusted $0.89.","Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.15 billion compared to $866.4 million at the end of fiscal 2016. Our outstanding long-term debt is approximately $6.3 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was essentially flat to the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 6.5%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 6.1%. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings in our sales initiatives for the second quarter.","Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at the quarter end decreased 3% from the same period last year, and decreased 4.2% on a selling square foot basis. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are seeing in our in stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the second quarter. ","Capital expenditures were $110.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 versus $175.9 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2017, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $760 million to $780 million. Capital expenditures, will be focused on new stores and remodels, including fee development stores; renovating 250 Family Dollar stores in 2017; the addition of further refrigerated capabilities for a total 400 new and existing Dollar Tree stores; the expansion of frozen and refrigerated of 300 Family Dollar stores IT system enhancements and integration projects; start up construction of our new Dollar Tree banner distribution center Warrensburg, Missouri; and the continued build-out of a new office building for the Store support center here in Chesapeake, Virginia.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $153.9 million for the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $162.3 million for the first quarter of last year. For fiscal 2017, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $610 million to $630 million. Our updated outlook for fiscal 2017 includes the following assumptions; fiscal 2017 anticipate 53rd week, the extra week in the fourth quarter is expected to add $400 million to $430 million of sales and $0.19 to $0.22 to earnings per diluted share, both of which are included in guidance.","We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on state increasing minimum wages and general average hourly rate increases. We have budget higher import freight costs in the year ago starting in Q2 and higher diesel costs for the year. Net interest expense will be approximately $75 million per quarter in Q2 and Q3 and approximately $81 million in Q4 due to the extra week.","Our guidance does not include any share repurchase for 2017, and we cannot predict future currency fluctuations where we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36% from the second quarter and 36.5% for fiscal 2017. Weighted average diluted share counts assumed to be 237.7 million shares for both Q2 and the full year.","For the second quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.18 billion to $5.28 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.88. This represents an increase of 11% to 22% over the $0.72 reported EPS for Q2 last year. These estimates are based on a slightly positive, the low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year growth of 3.4%.","For fiscal 2017, we\u2019re now forecasting total sales to range between $21.95 billion and $22.25 billion compared to the Company\u2019s previously expected range of $21.94 billion to $22.33 billion. The Company now anticipates diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 will range between $4.17 and $4.43, which includes the $0.13 receivable impairment charge. Excluding the $0.13 impairment charge, the top of the guidance range is consistent with our prior guidance.","These estimates are based on a slightly positive to low single digit same-store sales increase and 3.9% square footage growth and includes the benefit of the 53rd week occurring in Q4 of fiscal 2017. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks Kevin. Again, I\u2019m extremely pleased with another terrific first quarter performance at Dollar Tree and I\u2019m equally enthusiastic about what lies ahead of us at Family Dollar. The teams have worked incredibly hard at rebuilding the foundation for a very successful and profitable business. I believe that we\u2019re well positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increase value for our long-term shareholders.","Dollar Tree is now a diversified combination of 6,000 store chain and an 8,000 store chain each with its unique ability to effectively serve more customers through all types of markets. With the combination of these two great brands, we have great flexibility in how we choose to grow while expanding our opportunity to grow. We will continue to focus on providing greater values to our customers, while delivering superior returns to our long-term shareholders.","The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve; it\u2019s powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of sales and earnings. While our price point has remained the same $1 for the past 30 years now, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector.","As always, we will continue to employ a thoughtful disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined enterprise through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. Most importantly, we will maintain a laser focus on the customer, maintaining relevance to their needs and above all delivering value, convenience and a full fun and friendly shopping experience.","Our fundamentals have been tested by time and validated by results, we are confident that continuing to place our emphasis in these areas can materially enhance the operating performance at Family Dollar with improvements in sales, margin, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.","Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value and convenience no matter the state of the economy. At Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we have both. It all starts with our associates, our merchandize teams and our field management and leadership teams, our talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It\u2019s a great time to be Dollar Tree.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Alan Rifkin with BTIG.","Alan Rifkin","Bob, can you maybe just provide an update on where you are with the expected synergies now that almost two years through the acquisition. I recall your original guidance speaks 300 million and even this last quarter you said you remained comfortable with that number. Could you please give us an update there?","Bob Sasser","We are confident with the 300 million that we have guided to. We feel very -- we feel like we\u2019re squarely in the zone where we need to be at this time. As you remember there was 300 million run rate synergies by the end of third full year with an investment of 300 million to achieve those. So I can tell you that we\u2019re right on target to achieve the 300 million.","Alan Rifkin","And could you just tell us the Missouri DC that will be added. Will that emulates the St. George DC, which was fulfilling both banners, and now that you\u2019ve had some time to take a looking and evaluate the St. George. What\u2019s the prognosis for the DC supporting both banners, which I believe would give you a significant supply chain savings? Thank you.","Bob Sasser","Alan, it\u2019s another good question. The Missouri DC will -- we will be using catalyst, which is the WMS that we use in our Family Dollar DC, it\u2019s also the one that we modified in St. George Utah in order to ship both banner. So we\u2019re taking the modify version of the St. George WMS and we\u2019re going to open the new Missouri DC with that WMS. That will be our go to WMS as we open and continue to expand or convert distribution centers as we go forward.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","As you put in all the hard work with Family Dollar, have cleaner store it\u2019s been in stock, elevated levels of customer service. Surely you didn\u2019t expect comp down 1% is or in your experience with this business. Why do you think it\u2019s not better than this?","Gary Philbin","I think the sale of Q1 really speaks to what happened in the marketplace, especially on the tax refund. So just to give you a little color; obviously, one knows the tax refunds are delayed. In particular, the earned income tax credit was delayed to week of 27th. In fact you could see by day when it actually hit. So when we take a look at the quarter period one month of February not only was impacted by the discretionary piece of the business that our customers weighed on because that tax refund and spend but really becomes a capital investment for them and that was delayed until really the last week; and while we saw that pop compared to year ago that was probably two-week shift and go back two years and really was in entire month of February.","As we went through March, even with the shift in Easter, we were on track with where we thought sales would be for March. And I think Easter at Family Dollar was in the target zone too. So if you got back to a regular cadence, we could see our customer respond. So clearly, we\u2019re never happy when we see a negative comp. But what we could measure qualify and see both across just top-line sales and as you go down to a line of business was a delay in the income tax credit that our customer experienced in the month of February.","I don't think it's anything structurally different with the business. We continue to invest, I think, in the right things in our business, invest in clear stores, get exciting merchandising on end caps and on the frontend of the stores, give our folks a reason to drive comp store sales. Those are the things that we're going to build over the long run that's going to drive the business. So we\u2019re very focused as we go into May into second quarter businesses back to focus on what's going to happen in the summer season, and for Family Dollar that means grow out. For Dollar Tree that means we're in midst to just passing Mother's Day graduations or in full bloom and Memorial Day is ahead of us. We have the right product the store to drive Q2 business, and we're focused on doing that across both banners.","Michael Lasser","Thank you, Gary. And my follow up questions is, first, do you think Easter shift and can you quantify how much Easter shift contributed to the mid-single digit comp that you experienced at Family Dollar in April. And now that we're -- now that SNAP drag from last year has been anniversary. Do you think that cause income improvement in the business that should continue into the second quarter and beyond?","Gary Philbin","Michael, I\u2019ve missed the second part of the questions. What was the second, [multiple speakers], thank you. So for the first part, I think -- listen our later Easter helps Dollar Tree tremendously and Family Dollar, not only is it the Easter Holiday it really becomes the kick up to spring. So while we hadn\u2019t qualified it for enterprise, both banners had a better Easter than the year ago, because of just warmer spring weather and the Family Dollar that also means some of our other categories outside of peer Easter apparel, health and beauty responded the right way.","Secondly, on staff benefits I told you before at Family Dollar I view it as sort of the canary and the mind shaft, listen it's a small piece of our business. To me, it gives us a great every first of month how we're doing. And while we know benefits of what the market at the Family Dollar banner, we\u2019ve seen it all consistently to last year. At Dollar Tree penetration is down a little bit, but I think that speaks to a little more of Dollar Tree was doing first the month and getting ready for us. And at Family Dollar, it\u2019s really been our focus now.","So I think it shows up in our staff benefits. It gives us confidence that we're getting ready on first of month in a better way across our stores. They have -- its spread out by state differently, but first 10 days are still so important for our Family Dollar customer to getting ready being in stock and having our folks ready to give great service.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Tanal","I guess, I've been most focused to start on the Family Dollar margin rate. And I'd be curious to know kind of how you're thinking about both the level in Q1 and how the year-on-year should trend over the balance of the year? And then any comments maybe on a longer term levels that are achievable in that business will be helpful.","Gary Philbin","Let me start off Stephen. Q1 was -- besides the sales in the items that impacted us a year ago, we were coming out of our cleanup of inventory. We got the benefit of both the fact that we start off with great strength at the beginning of 2016, we just cleans up a lot of the dribs and drabs that had accumulated in store. We also came out of the winter time with basically cleaned up in a nice way on apparel too. So once you sale on some of the margin piece, just maybe back to normal cadence, we can only do better, but a normal cadence of where we are on strength and our markdowns in Q1.","But again, the one thing that was really different in period one because of the tax refunds being late was the mix shift, and the impact on what our customer buys. Our consumables were slightly positive for the quarter. They bought what they needed to get by. The difference of what they wanted to buy across the discretionary departments and it\u2019s really what we felt in period one that we could measure that impacted margins in a big way for the quarter. So that was a story for Q1. But Kevin I think comment on the forecast, but obviously we've put everything that we know at this point into our forecast for the balance of the year.","Kevin Wampler","So I think consistent on a consolidated basis with what we said last quarter; if you would look at a range of guidance, the mid-point of our operating income is roughly an 88 or 89 basically. And also that compares to I think about H2 last year. So also, we're overall expecting improvement. As part of that, we do expect to see the Dollar business, as we go through the year, improve upon where we were during Q1. So I think there is an expectation overall that the business will improve there and as we go forward. So had some -- Gary mentioned, some various timing thing that affected Q1 a little bit more than maybe expected, but we're looking for some better things as we go forward.","Stephen Tanal","And then just the follow up, I think you said the synergies, maybe the one-time costs there that are flowing through OpEx. Can you maybe give us an update, was that a net benefit or a net drag year-on-year and how that will play out as well?","Kevin Wampler","Well, I don't know how to speak to it from a drag or a benefit. I think obviously the cost that we're going to be spending that we're aware of are in our forecast as always along with the associated synergies that we're expecting this year. So that's no different than any other time. From an overall standpoint, we said $300 million to achieve a little bit more frontend loaded. And again that was true if you remember right we re-bannered basically 300 stores, 300 Family Dollar stores, we re-bannered 200 Dollar deal store to Dollar Tree. So there was a lot of CapEx costs associated with that in the first year and half basically, so that was a big part of it. As I said before, when we started this process, we said that the $300 million our best guess was OpEx half CapEx. And as I\u2019ve said as we went through this, it\u2019s probably been little bit more CapEx at the end of the day and little less OpEx. But again, still have been our targeted range of what we would expected from the beginning from an achievement standpoint as well as a cost to achieve.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","You said earlier in the call that you feel like you\u2019ve gotten the basically the format for Family Dollar in place now that you kind of use going forward. Can you just give us a sense for do you think that in terms of the pricing versus competition, you feel like you\u2019ve kind of have the majority behind you and that you\u2019re in good shape going forward there; of course, tweaks and what not, but maybe just around pricing? And then also just in terms of the buying synergies, any sense for between the two banners, how much overlap there is in there and how much maybe more is to be realized?","Gary Philbin","Let me comment on the pricing, I think they were in retail we\u2019re going to pay attention just about a weekly basis. And so clearly, while we\u2019re pleased with what the format does because I think it makes some logical adjacencies for our customers to shop Family Dollar in a more productive and easier way for the customer that shows value. When it comes to pricing, we still are going to highlight the smart way to save, which our customer responds to across all the elements that we\u2019ve been talking about.","We\u2019ve got to show everyday prices on the shelf. We got have price drop, sale items that resonate with them on the things they buy most often. Compare and save. But we\u2019re excited about this private brand redo and make it because we have a pretty good private brand program, but the values that we can show our customer and now we\u2019re freshening up the label as we think will go a long way. But the pricing piece will continue to be something we watch now and going through, it\u2019s just the nature of the beast as we make sure that we have the right retails on shelf and gives us flexibility with the smart ways to save whether electronic with smart coupons are on the shelf.","Synergy, I would tell you that merchants work together on a couple of different elements. One we basically think about it in two ways, one it\u2019s our domestic supplier. So what we have maybe about 10% overlap of between skews, it\u2019s bigger than that when we consider some of the similar items we buy; so aluminum foil might be that poster child, we\u2019re most likely five square feet at Dollar Tree bigger size for Family Dollar. But I would tell you on the import side, there is also an opportunity that we want to cycle through those buying trips four times a year. So we get four chances to get our integration going and have the merchants talk about what\u2019s going to be bought for the following years.","So keep in mind as you\u2019re taking a look at some of the import side, the lead time is longer what\u2019s to show up in the synergy takes that amount of time for us to review our assortment to buy it, ship it, take it through the holidays then we revamp and redo for the following season. We\u2019ll have more of it. There is certainly more opportunities for us to continue above and beyond what we had targeted to drive synergies. And I would say as much as anything reviewing assortments and driving excitement inside the assortment.","Vincent Sinisi","And maybe just as a fast follow-up, just now with the Family Dollar format kind of fully in place. Any qualitative or quantitative way we should think about footage growth annually by banner more of the split in there kind of post this year? Thanks very much.","Gary Philbin","We haven\u2019t really spoken to that, I would just tell you maybe what excites us from a customer perspective is the way they shop the store across the categories that we\u2019ve invest in. I mentioned immediate consumption. Our front-end that\u2019s more productive the fact that you can party and toys and gift cards are now in similar adjacencies that a mom who comes in the store can buy new born infant, toddler apparel next the diapers. So just some maybe retail one-o-one items that I think just drives better business and make it easier for our customer to shop.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joseph Feldman with Telsey Group.","Joseph Feldman","So wanted to go back also on Family Dollar business. Are you -- can you help us understand when we should start to see the operating margin improvement, I guess, accelerate? I think certainly there are some out there, including myself, that would have thought that we\u2019d be seeing a little bit better margin improvement, not necessarily gross, but just overall operating margin improvement at the Family Dollar business at this point. And I just wanted to get your sense of timing on that?","Bob Sasser","I think a couple of combinations. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about the foundation of things that we\u2019re putting in; we said we\u2019re in this for the long run. And we\u2019ve done the things that we think as on the right path for running better stores, better assortments, better value on shelf; I think what we\u2019re describing, what the renovation program now and something and that\u2019s maybe a little more visible for our customer to see, which also is going to be one of the engines that helps us drive overall margin growth; so as we do our 250 renovations this year as the new stores come out with the new format.","Now, our customers is going to see something in fiscal way in a store that\u2019s cleaner, fuller, fresher and that\u2019s really another piece to the puzzle here that we\u2019ve been focused on to say let\u2019s change the complexion of the fleet of stores and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see in the back half of this year. And I am anxious to get those out of ground, because I think those are the elements that combined with all the things we\u2019ve been talking about; table stakes, merchandising energy in store assortments. But we also have to touch the fiscal plan to these facilities to make sure our customer sees a nice new fresh store when they\u2019re going to make a decision of where they\u2019re going to shop. So its hand-in-hand, we got to do both. You\u2019ve heard us to talk and about really in the first portion at this point in the renovation new store program is really next piece to this.","Joseph Feldman","And then just as a follow-up. With regard to some of the clearance activity, I guess not clearance, but with the rebranding of the private label, I guess. I\u2019m curious how that will impact the clearance of the older inventory and how that\u2019s baked into your outlook?","Bob Sasser","I would say in most cases, we\u2019re just flowing at the high of the whether it\u2019s the candy or whether it\u2019s the trash bags; most of these consumables, they turns pretty quickly. And while we may have some, it\u2019s all baked into our forecast. Most of these are going to be flow throughs with the existing SKU on the shelf being replaced by a new package.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi.","Alvin Concepcion","Last quarter, I think you mentioned, you hadn\u2019t seen much change in the past year and half in the competitive promotional environment. Did you see that stability continue to 1Q and further into the second quarter?","Bob Sasser","I think competitions always part of our life. I watch intensely as does field operators and our merchants and what the competitors are doing from a couple of points of view are they doing with merchandise mix and businesses that they\u2019re driving, as well as price, the pricing statements that they\u2019re making. So we continue to shop. We see a lot of -- there is a lot of new competition out there, or coming in, especially in the grocery business. We\u2019re not a grocery store but we still sell some food and sell beverage and snacks and those types of product. So we\u2019re watching that intensely. But at the same time, we remain focused on our customer, what our customers\u2019 needs are and how do we put together that value equation for our customers. Gary was taking a Family Dollar that all the different ways to save with our add prices and our every day prices and price drops, which are surprising price value to our customers.","So we\u2019re going to stay focused on that; we\u2019re going to watch what the competition does; we\u2019re going to shop the price on key items, name brand items as we always have diligently; it\u2019s different by market; we pay attention across the country. And we\u2019re doing to evolve our business based on what our customers need. This new renovation program is just rolling up in second quarter, and we\u2019re really excited about it, because it does take a lot of the components that we\u2019ve been talking about and testing in different stores and puts some together. So our new stores are starting to rollout with the new adjacencies with the new mix of products, with the new store designs, as well as going back and renovating.","Right now, we\u2019re seeing 250 stores obviously based on performance we got put on the accelerator that exceeds expectations we certainly would jump on all over it. And then the other thing is radically rollout the renovations. The things that we found that are really compelling to the customers to the new stores we still have the ability to roll pieces in parts out to the existing fleet where we know it\u2019s going to be a home run. So competition is retail, retail is competition. I have great respect for all of them. We\u2019re going to keep watching them and we\u2019re especially going to stay focused on the customer and how they respond to what we offer in our stores.","Alvin Concepcion","And just a quick follow-up on the comps. It sounds like you\u2019re seeing more normalized trends in the second quarter, enough to give you confidence in the annual number. Just wondering if you could give us some more color on what you\u2019re seeing in second quarter since they were many issues in 1Q you called out?","Bob Sasser","I wish I could tell you exactly, but it's early. Yes, we feel good about our guidance we have all that we know embedded into our guidance for second quarter. We have a lot of -- still that was just early on in the quarter; Mother's Day was good; this weekend is Memorial Day holiday; and we\u2019re expecting good things from that; and of course graduations based in our Dollar Tree business, is a big idea; and the Father's day and beyond. At Family Dollar it's all those things plus a bigger seasonal summer offering, because at Family Dollar we sell fans. So when it gets hot, we can sell lots more fans and beach supplies and coolers and charcoal grills and all the things we're cooking out. This should be a big weekend for that, as well as the apparel business at Family Dollar.","As the weather warms, as we get bright blue sunny skies we\u2019re seeing the apparel business take off; so there is a lot of bright spot. And just to step back and I would tell you that the big issue once more in first quarter on sales at Family Dollar was the delay in the tax refund checks. They were late and the business was in February was stubborn and difficult. But when the checks it you could see it day-by-day and you could see improvement in the sales. And then we came in to March where we lost Easter at pretty good March and met our expectations. We had a good Easter, but we could not make up what we lost in February. And that's the story that you see.","Our discretionary business is what suffered, our consumer -- the things that they needed even with a bad -- with getting the checks like what they brought what they needed. So our consumable business was slightly up over the quarter, but our discretionary businesses were all of the comp decrease was. So that really is the story, but what happened at Family Dollar is it was structural it was do with our new assortments, it was more to do with just way things spell on those tax check, especially for that low income customer which we have a lot of Family Dollar. These tax checks to those lowest income customers they wait for them they count on them, and that's when they buy things like clothing and that's when they buy the things that they'd like to have but just can't afford to have of the times of the year.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Our question is from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever","I'll just ask a couple of big picture questions, first of all, on the border adjusted tax. Just wondering, I know it's very iffy as to what happens there, but if that something that you're thinking about and is there any kind of contingency planning that things around it if it were to come to be? And then second question is just Bob, I know the past few conference calls you've had somewhat cautious comments about the economic well being of the -- of your core customer. And I know that later tax refunds were a big issue in the first quarter. But just thinking about your core customer, do you still feeling little cautious, or do you feel like things are getting better there?","Bob Sasser","Well, to that first of all, the border adjustable tax is still out there, still being debated in Congress. And I was watch on last night, night before last, reruns on C-SPAN of the House Ways and Means Committee and as they were talking to some retailers about the border adjustable tax and trying to get more tax and frame their position on that. It is still up in the air, it\u2019s not until we know what it is we really don\u2019t know how to organize around it. I think we\u2019re doing exactly what we should be doing and paying attention to it and trying to understand it as well as what\u2019s going and talking to our congressmen, talking to our senators, working with RILA and the other groups that are out there supporting retail and putting our position forward.","So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re actively been doing that and we\u2019ll see how it goes. I don\u2019t want to sit here and prognosticate one way or other what Congress will do it. But I think at the end of the day hopefully they will get it right and we\u2019ll have good result to this. So they are on to initiatives going on right now what is this and what is that; there is too many what ifs and too many open questions to make anything meaningful right now. So I would do exactly what we need to be doing right now, Patrick.","On the health of the consumer, we serve the lowest consumer up through middle income consumers. So we serve a broad swath of consumers out there and I believe what I said in the past that the consumer was under pressure and concerned. I still think that\u2019s the case, and I think some of the -- whether it\u2019s the economic questions that are out there with healthcare and Healthcare Reform and tax reform, and all of the issues that we\u2019re working with at Congress. I think all of those had uncertainty as long as there is uncertainty, then the American consumer is -- they\u2019re focused on being the light bill; they are focused on paying the rent, house payment, care payment; all the things; employment, will have a job, do I have a job until you get confident in their position that they do have a job and they can\u2019t pay the bills; there\u2019s going to be continue to be uncertainty.","At Dollar Tree and at Family Dollar, we card every day to be one of the answers to their issues as they strive to balance their budgets, as they try to take their paycheck and spread it across the month, for the week, whatever the pay cycle is. We want to be part of the solution to their issues. We want to help them balance their budget by the things they want at great prices, great values surprising value. And at Dollar Tree you can slur because everything is still a dollar. Yes you can afford it at Dollar Tree you can go in and have a great party birthday party for the kids and for the family buys your seasonal product and still pay only a dollar.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Guiler, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Great, thank you, Christina.

Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Reid","Thank you, Debbie.  Good morning and welcome to the Dollar Tree conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.  Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in our business.  Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of the first quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2012.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and annual report on Form 10-K, all of which are on file with the SEC.  We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements and you should not expect us to do so.","At the end of our planned remarks, we will open the call to your questions which we ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, our President and CEO.  Bob?","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone.  This morning we announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $1 per diluted share.  This represents a 22% increase over the first quarter of 2011 earnings of $0.82 per share.  Comp store sales increased 5.6% in the quarter and total sales grew 11.5% to $1.72 billion.  Operating income increased by $26.3 million, operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared with the 10.5% operating margin in the first quarter last year, and net income increased 15% to $116.1 million.","I want to begin by saying that I\u2019m very pleased with these results.  Both sales and earnings growth exceeded the top end of guidance.  Comp store sales are growing consistently year-over-year.  Our comp increase of 5.6% this year was on top of a 7.1% comp in the first quarter last year and a 6.5% comp the year before.  Our operating margin of 10.9% was the highest first quarter operating margin we have ever produced.","Inventory turns increased again in first quarter.  Most importantly, our shelves are full of the right product, our stockrooms are in great shape, and we ended the quarter in stock, in business, and well prepared for our customers as we entered second quarter.  I\u2019m particularly proud of the day-by-day execution of our strategy across the organization.  The merchant teams continue to source and develop product that exceeds customer expectations of what one dollar can buy.  The product selection and assortment day-in and day-out is of the highest value and more relevant to our customers\u2019 needs than ever.  New customers are finding Dollar Tree and Deals to be a shopping destination and our store teams are working very hard to keep these customers coming back by delivering on our promise of a store that is clean, bright, friendly, and full of merchandise energy.","Our goal is to provide our customers a store that offers a balanced assortment of high-value basics, things that customers need every day alongside seasonally relevant and fun discretionary product, all for just a dollar.  Delivering on this promise requires a coordinated effort across the organization.  Bridging the gap from source to store, our supply chain is solid, scalable and efficient, and the logistics team is focused on smoothing and improving the flow of product.  Our information systems provide visibility to valuable data and we\u2019re using this information to effectively manage costs, increase inventory turns, and improve the customer experience.","Seasonal transitions in first quarter were well executed.  Fresh assortments arrived in a timely manner and our stores transitioned seamlessly almost overnight from one season to the next, while consistently maintaining high levels of in-stock on basic items that customers need every day.  At Dollar Tree and Deals, we\u2019re gaining new customers all the time and existing customers are shopping more frequently.  As a result, comp store sales growth in the first quarter was driven largely by traffic.  Of the 5.6% comp store sales increase, 5.4% came from increased transactions.","The top performing categories for the quarter included home products, food snacks and beverage, healthcare products, party supplies, household cleaning supplies, and seasonal merchandise.  Sales increases in the first quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories, which basic consumable categories generally growing at a faster pace.  This has been a continuing trend consistent with the difficult economy that we\u2019re experiencing.  With customers concerned over rising and uncertain fuel prices and high unemployment, many are finding Dollar Tree to be a destination for high value consumer products as they look for ways to balance their budgets.  At Dollar Tree, we remain focused on the needs of our customers, and our flexible assortment strategy enables our stores to be right for all times and relevant in all economic environments.","When customers are under pressure from the difficult economy, as they are now, they can look to Dollar Tree for extreme value on products they need every day.  As long as this trend continues, we plan to meet our customers\u2019 demand by providing these products consistently and at the highest value possible.  It\u2019s another reason to shop at Dollar Tree.  When customers are in the store shopping for the basics, we plan to give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high value and higher margin variety merchandise.  Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree you can still splurge \u2013 everything is only one dollar.  ","Sales cadence in first quarter reflected the growth in both consumable product and the growth of seasonal and variety merchandise sales.  In February, we got off to a great start with sales for Valentine\u2019s Day.  Customers were thrilled with our offerings of gift bags and tissue, candy and balloons, and at two for a dollar you can afford to buy Valentine\u2019s Day cards for more than one special person.  From Valentine\u2019s Day, our stores quickly transitioned to Easter and a Dollar Days event that was very successful and helped to sustain sales momentum into March.  The Dollar Days event included a solid present of housewares, home textiles, household plastics, and variety merchandise.  As planned, sales momentum continued to build in March and peaked at Easter, which was two weeks earlier this year on April 8.  Performance in the first quarter was relatively consistent across the country with the highest comps coming from the mid-Atlantic and the midwest, followed closely by New England and the southwest.  ","Our stores have broad appeal.  Our growth strategy remains consistent and can be summarized into five points:  more stores, more productive stores, new formats, new markets, and new channels.  In reference to more stores, during the first quarter this year we opened 110 new stores, relocated and expanded another 44 stores, and grew total square footage 7.1% relative to this time last year.  We ended the quarter with 4,451 stores and we\u2019re on track with our plan for the full-year 2012, which includes 315 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 390 projects across the U.S. and Canada.","In addition to opening new Dollar Tree and Deals stores, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand categories, to grow new retail formats, to expand geographic reach, and to open more productive stores, increasing store productivity overall.  New store productivity has increased consistently for six years, driven by improved site selection, by right-sizing our stores to the market, by opening new stores earlier in the year, through improved staffing building the bench of qualified store management, and by emphasizing and expanding the most productive categories of merchandise.  Last year, average new store productivity increased to its highest level in 10 years.  While it\u2019s still very early, I\u2019m pleased with the productivity of this year\u2019s new store class and I am happy to report that we are ahead of plan.","Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues.  We installed freezers and coolers in 127 stores in the first quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,345 stores.  We are planning approximately 325 installations for the full year.  This important category is extremely productive.  It serves the current needs of our customers, drives traffic into our stores, and provides incremental sales across all categories.","Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats and the expansion of our geographic reach.  Our Deals format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential.  Deals delivers low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product.  At Deals, our goal is to surprise and delight our customers on every visit and we\u2019re seeing evidence of success.  Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness of the Deals brand is growing, and the concept is building momentum.  In the first quarter, as in the past several quarters, Deals traffic, average ticket and average unit retail all continued to increase compared with the previous year.  Comp store sales in our Deals stores have been robust.","We\u2019re encouraged with the growth potential of Deals and the opportunity that it provides to serve even more customers.  We ended the quarter with a total of 186 Deals stores across 18 states and we\u2019re on track with our growth plan for 2012.","In addition to growing new formats, we have opportunity for growth in new geographies.  Our expansion into Canada continues.  We initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010.  As you will remember from earlier comment, we intend to operate our Canadian stores on an identical platform to the merchandising and productivity systems that support our stores in the U.S.  Our primary focus in 2011 was to install retail systems, integrate processes, merchandise assortments and store teams, and to lay the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market.","To summarize our progress, to date we have aligned both the merchandise organization and the merchandise plans.  We\u2019re in the process of rationalizing and cleaning up the non-go-forward merchandise assortment in the stores and DCs, replacing Dollar Giant assortments with higher value Dollar Tree merchandise.  We\u2019re solidifying our logistics model in Canada, changing from a model that was heavily vendor-direct to store delivery to our U.S. model of supplying most of merchandise through the distribution centers, of which we have two in Canada.  We have completed the installation and training of store-level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems in all stores, gaining visibility to sales and inventory by store by SKU while we are building sales history.  These are key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain.  ","Equally important, we\u2019ve conducted SKU-level inventories in each store and we\u2019re beginning to roll out auto-replenishment of basics and smart allocations of new and seasonal merchandise.  As we look to the future, the necessary tools and information are coming into place.  Just as we have done in the U.S., the result will be more efficient store operations, an increased level of in-stock of basic products, higher store productivity, increased inventory turns, and most importantly improved customer satisfaction.","We\u2019re extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree Canada.  I\u2019m proud of what the team has accomplished so far and I know that we have a tremendous opportunity for profitable growth in Canada as we leverage our investments.  This year, we intend to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand and we\u2019re well on our way to achieving this goal.  We opened eight new stores in the first quarter and ended the quarter with 107 stores in Canada.  As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores.  This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States plus additional growth in our Deals format.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I\u2019d like to give you an update on Dollar Tree Direct, our online business.  As most of you know, Dollar Tree Direct is an additional channel distribution, providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand, and attract more customers into our stores.  Dollar Tree Direct now offers more than 2,500 items online.  Traffic on the sites grew to 4 million visitors in the first quarter, a 19% increase over the first quarter last year, and if you haven\u2019t already had the opportunity, I invite you to take a look at our sites at dollartree.com, dealstores.com, dollartreecanada.com, espanoldollartree.com, or check us out on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter or Pinterest.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance.","Kevin Wampler","Thanks, Bob.  As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 22% in the first quarter to $1 per share.  The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 35% gross profit margin, and a 40 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the first quarter of last year.  ","Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 35% during the first quarter, consistent with the 35% reported in the first quarter last year.  We leveraged occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 5.6% comp store sales growth.  This improvement offset the impact of the continuing shifts in product mix as basic consumable products increased by 110 basis points as a percentage of sales in the first quarter.  In addition, freight expense increased to a small degree relative to sales as the impacts of diesel prices that averaged $0.21 per gallon above the same period last year more than offset the savings on ocean freight.  Also, shrink increased slightly as a percent of sales.","SG&A expenses were 24.1% of sales for the quarter, a 40 basis point improvement from the first quarter last year.  This was driven primarily by expense leverage across several categories, most notably payroll reflecting improved productivity at the field management and store level.  In addition, utility costs decreased due to favorable weather conditions and trash removal costs were lower.  Depreciation expense declined by about 10 basis points and debit and credit card fees declined, reflecting the lower legislated rates which more than offset continued growth in usage of these types of tender.  In the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year, debit card penetration increased 140 basis points and credit card penetration increased 10 basis points.  These improvements were partially offset by higher expenses for stock compensation and health insurance benefits.","Operating income increased $26.3 million compared to the first quarter last year, and operating margin was 10.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the 10.5% operating margin in the first quarter last year.  The tax rate for the quarter was 38.4%.  This compares with a 37.5% tax rate in the first quarter last year which included the benefits of the Hire Act and work opportunity tax credit programs, both of which expired at the end of last calendar year.","Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, cash investments at quarter end totaled $382.3 million, an increase of $94 million during the quarter.  Cash and investments totaled 510.3 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2011.  ","During the first quarter, we completed our $300 million accelerated share repurchase that was initiated in November 2011.  We also repurchased an additional 49,000 shares of Dollar Tree stock for $4.5 million.  As you may remember, in October of 2011 the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for share repurchase.  As of quarter end, we have $1.2 billion remaining in our authorization.  We will continue to view share repurchase opportunistically and we will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur.  At the end of the first quarter, the diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 116.4 million.","Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 13.5% greater than at the same time last year while selling square footage increased 7.1%.  Consolidated inventory per selling square foot at cost increased by 5.9%, reflecting an increase in goods on the water at the end of the first quarter as we continued to execute our smoothing of inventory flow throughout our logistics network, as we have previously discussed, and to provide for planned new store growth in the second quarter.  Additionally, our Dollar Tree Canada inventory increased as we transitioned these stores to a DC delivery model from a direct store delivery model beginning in the second quarter of last year.  We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate for our current sales plan.  Also, inventory turns increased in the first quarter and we expect continued improvement in our inventory turns for the full year.","Capital expenditures were $65.4 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus 58.3 million in the first quarter last year.  For fiscal year 2012, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of 330 to $340 million.  Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT system enhancements, and approximately $80 million towards a new distribution center in the northeast U.S.  Total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $95 million.","Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter totaled $41.8 million versus 39.3 million in the first quarter last year.  We expect depreciation expense to be in the range of 170 to $180 million for the year.","Our guidance for 2012 includes a couple of assumptions.  First, regarding freight, while we are pleased with the results of our May 1 ocean freight contract negotiations, diesel prices have risen since we issued our previous guidance.  The net effect is that we believe freight costs overall will be somewhat higher than those incorporated in our previous guidance.  Second, as we previously disclosed, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks.  This is expected to add 120 to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter and the full year.  Third, our guidance assumes a tax rate of 38.3% for both the second quarter and the full year.  Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 116.6 million shares for the second quarter and 116.7 million shares for the full year.  While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.","With this in mind, for the second quarter of 2012 we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.66 billion to $1.70 billion, based on a low to mid-single digit comparable store sales increase and 7.1% square footage growth.  Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.93, an increase of 13% to 20.8% over second quarter 2011 earnings per share of $0.77.  As a reminder, the second quarter last year included a previously disclosed benefit to gross profit from a favorable inventory adjustment related to immaterial corrections to prior periods.","For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.33 billion to $7.46 billion based on a low to mid-single digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.1% square footage growth.  Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.94, representing an increase of between 17.6% and 22.6% over our record earnings per share of $4.03 in fiscal 2011.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Kevin.  We entered this year with goals to drive more customer traffic, to delight our customers with surprising values on merchandise they need and want, to improve our shopping experience, and to build market share.  I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019re off to a good start towards accomplishing these goals.  First quarter sales grew 11.5% to a record $1.72 billion.  Driven by increased customer traffic, comp store sales increased 5.6% on top of a 7.1% comp last year.  Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever.  Our turns increased again in the first quarter and we entered second quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand.  Our operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 10.9%.  That\u2019s the all-time highest first quarter operating margin in our history.  Net income grew 15% to $116.1 million and earnings per share increased by 22% to $1 per share.","In addition, we opened 110 new stores across the U.S. and Canada, and so far the productivity of the new store class has been performing ahead of last year.  The Deals brand is gaining traction, both traffic and average ticket are growing.  Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach and we\u2019re working to build and expand our Canadian business.","As I look to the future, I see even more opportunity to grow our business through new Dollar Tree stores, more productive stores, and category expansion.  We\u2019re developing new formats and new channels with Deals and Dollar Tree Direct, and we\u2019re expanding geographically as Canada provides an opportunity for substantial growth.  All of this provides a roadmap for sustained profitable growth ahead.","We\u2019re now ready for your questions.  So that we can accommodate as many callers as time permits, we ask that you limit your questions to two.

Again star, one for questions.","We\u2019ll go first today to John Zolidis with Buckingham Research Group.","John Zolidis \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","Hi, good morning.  Great results.  I have a question on traffic versus ticket, or two questions, rather.  So the first question is on the traffic, which was very impressive \u2013 up 5%.  Can you talk about some of the factors that may have contributed to that and whether the earlier Easter actually clipped some of the traffic?  And my second question is on the ticket, which was roughly flat during the quarter.  You mentioned that the Deals stores were showing ticket increase, perhaps suggesting that\u2019s doing slightly better than the core Dollar Tree stores.  Can you talk about the difference that might be going on in Deals versus Dollar Tree?  And then also with the cooler roll-out, does that contribute more to traffic gains or more to ticket gains?  Thank you.","Bob Sasser","Well John, the cooler roll-out contributes more to\u2014has been recently contributing more to traffic gains.  It\u2019s a faster turning product.  It\u2019s a product category that people buy more frequently.  One of the reasons we like it so much is that it does give us\u2014first of all, it fills a customer need.  They\u2019re responding very favorably to it, but it gets the customer to come to us more often, and more footsteps in the store gives us the ability to showcase our seasonal product and all the variety merchandise that we do so well in and is so important to our continued profitability.  I mentioned that our consumer products are growing; our variety sales were also growing.  The consumer products are growing generally by category at a faster pace than the variety, but they\u2019re both growing very nicely.","So the traffic increase of 5.4%, I view as a terrific metric.  We\u2019re gaining more customers all the time.  When they\u2019re in the stores, they\u2019re buying the assortment that we have to offer, and by the way I think they\u2019re coming back more frequently.  I know they are because of things like frozen and refrigerated foods, because of our health and beauty care items that we sell, because of our household products that we sell.  So it was a very healthy first quarter.","It was a little, to your point\u2014the flow was a little different because it always is when you have an earlier Easter.  Easter was April 8 this year \u2013 two weeks earlier \u2013 so we had terrific February, we had a terrific March leading up into that Easter April 8.  And then as we thought, we were up against Easter for two weeks the year before, and as we planned, the sales fell back after those two weeks after Easter this year.  But all in all, we had a terrific first quarter \u2013 5.6%, most of it being driven by traffic.","John Zolidis \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Boss with JP Morgan.","Matt Boss \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey, good morning.  Can you speak to initial markup in the first quarter and your expectations for the second half of the year?","Bob Sasser","Initial markup was up in the first quarter.  You know, when you talk about initial markup, it\u2019s all about the\u2014just the initial markup by category, we have a really strong handle around that.  The mix of products that we sell is really the thing that drives any variation in our gross profit, or most of the variation in our gross profit.  So you know, we\u2019ve just come back from a trip in April.  Our buyers have been, as they always are in April, in China and in Asia sourcing for the next spring and the next Valentine\u2019s Day, the next Easter product; and I can tell you that our future has never been brighter.  The markup from that trip was\u2014we hit our target markup.  Our buyers are saying that they\u2019re not seeing any signs of pricing pressure.  Basically, pricing would be characterized on this past trip as stable or maybe even better, depending on the category.  So our initial markup, we feel very confident about being able to manage that part of our business \u2013 always have had.","Matt Boss \u2013 JP Morgan","Great.  And then your same stores sales accelerated on a two- and a three-year basis in the first quarter.  As we look to the early start of 2Q, have you seen the favorable trends continue?","Bob Sasser","Well, it\u2019s only two and a half weeks into Q2, and we certainly don\u2019t announce weekly sales, but the color is that we started off Q2 very well.  We had a really nice Mother\u2019s Day holiday and there\u2019s nothing that has begun in Q2 that would give me any pause over the guidance that we just gave.  We\u2019re off to a great start in Q2.","Matt Boss \u2013 JP Morgan","Great.  And real quick on Canada \u2013 I learned that a Field\u2019s dollar store operator in western Canada was closing a bunch of stores.  Could this be an additional opportunity for you guys in the region?","Bob Sasser","You know, we look at all opportunities, but that\u2019s probably a very small opportunity in that.  We were aware of that, by the way.","Matt Boss \u2013 JP Morgan","Great, sounds good.  Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.  Kevin, you had mentioned\u2014it sounded like diesel prices are up a little bit, and freight costs a little bit higher than your original expectations for the year.  Help us think about what that means for margins as we think through the remainder of the year.","Kevin Wampler","Yeah, so obviously we\u2019ve taken into consideration where the pricing is today in our go-forward guidance is a little higher than what we had in our guidance when we gave it back in late February.  As we\u2019ve always said, diesel prices being--$0.10 of increase in diesel price will be about $0.08, so if diesel is up $0.10 for a full year, it equates to about $0.08 of earnings at the end of the day\u2014or excuse me, $1 does.  So $0.10 is just a piece of that \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, I misspoke there - $1 increase in diesel is about $0.08 for the year, so it\u2019s a tenth of that.  So it\u2019s very small in the overall scheme of things right now, but obviously the marketplace has been very choppy, to say the least, if you look at it in the sense of the way it\u2019s been up and down.  So our crystal ball isn\u2019t any better than anybody else\u2019s realistically to that, so we\u2019ve tried to take the position of expecting it to stay in the area of where it\u2019s at.","Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And then Bob, I\u2019m just wondering\u2014you know, you have such a good pulse on your consumer.  I\u2019m just wondering as you talk about the traffic and ticket, I guess this is now the second quarter in a row where most of the comp was driven by traffic as opposed to the first three quarters of last year you definitely saw ticket being a lever of those helping drive comps.  How do you think about this in terms of what does this tell you about the consumer out there, in terms of how cautious they are with their spending?  What, if anything, does that mean when you see traffic start to be the predominant driver of comps as you kind of think through the rest of the year?","Bob Sasser","Well Adrianne, I think it means that we\u2019re getting new customers and they\u2019re coming from all walks of life, all demographics.  We\u2019re getting new customers, so more traffic in our stores from new customers.  Our mix of product that we have evolved to because of customer demand is more of the things that are purchased more often, so existing customers are shopping us also more frequently.  The price is still a dollar, so when you talk about the average ticket, that sometimes has been a little stubborn.  I view the traffic increase, though, as increase in market share.  I view it as more customers finding us every day, and our goal in the stores now is when we get these new customers in, to really, really show them a shopping experience, and that starts with all the fun things that we do at the front of the store with our variety merchandise and our seasonal, and at the same time in-stock and in business on what they came to shop for.  We are better in-stock today on basic, needed product than we\u2019ve ever been.  When they spend their dollar on their fuel, or $4 sometimes on their gasoline, and they come to our stores, we want to make sure that we give them what they need.  So there\u2019s really a concentrated effort on in-stock home basics, running great stores, fun stores, friendly stores, and we\u2019re working on improving the average ticket all the time.  I think some of the initiatives that we have in place driving impulse sales on our front end, drive items at our checkouts, the items of the week \u2013 all the things when you walk into the store we\u2019re really challenging our customers to add one more item to their basket, and I see that as just an opportunity.  If we get the customer traffic in the store, I believe we can then drive some of that average ticket up.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, just a reminder, in order to give everyone an opportunity, we ask that you limit yourself to two questions.  We\u2019ll go next today to Charles Grom from Deutsche Bank.","Charles Grom- Deutsche Bank","Thanks, good morning everybody.  Kevin, it\u2019s been a long time since your inventory outpaced your sales growth, and I was wondering if you could maybe quantify for us how much of that inventory increase was to goods on the water and was the Canadian stores.  You did open up more stores in the quarter than we were modeling, and I\u2019m wondering how many of those were towards the tail end that may have added a little bit more inventory while not getting the benefit from sales.","Kevin Wampler","Sure.  So in regards to the various points that we raised in the sense of goods on the water, we\u2019ve talked a lot about smoothing of inventory flow through our network over the last couple years and the benefits it brings to the entire organization.  It all starts with the buy and the scheduled shipment, so we have obviously continued to shift some things around.  From an overall perspective, if we look at the things\u2014goods on the water, which is a large portion of the increase, Canada was a little less than the goods on the water at the end of the day.","The other thing I would mention is that another factor potentially that really relates to this is our shift in mix of product.  So you\u2019ve got to remember, we\u2019re reporting inventory at cost and so part of the increase relates to that shift in the mix as our business has continued to have more consumable business.  That difference at retail is really a much smaller increase year-over-year, so that\u2019s a point of it as well.","And then I think the other thing to remember is that this is just a point a time disclosure and we have many ebbs and flows in any given year when we have\u2014we\u2019re moving over 250 million cartons of goods around the world.  So we look at that but we feel very good.  New stores \u2013 you know, we did do more new stores.  I think we did about 83 new stores last year in Q1; 110 this year, so we do have more new stores.  We have plenty of stores opening in Q2 as well, so there is a function of that as well.","But I would tell you the largest piece is the goods on the water and our Dollar Tree Canada at the end.","Charles Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.  I guess my follow-up would be if that\u2019s the case, what would you expect inventory to look like 90 days from now at the end of the second quarter?","Kevin Wampler","You know, I think it could look\u2014my guess it will potentially come down a little bit, but I would tell you the Canadian process really didn\u2019t really get started until Q2 last year, so that\u2019s likely to continue to be an increase year-over-year for Q2.  And again, the other is it\u2019s ebbs and flows \u2013 you don\u2019t know exactly when goods are going to get on the water.  We have some shipping windows and some things like that, but there\u2019s always ebbs and flows to that.  But it\u2019s possible it will come down a little bit.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","All right, great.  Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Joseph Parkhill with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Parkhill \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.  I was wondering if you could just comment quickly from the balance sheet perspective \u2013 I noticed the term loan moved to short-term debt, and the lack of share repurchases this quarter.  Is that a signal that you\u2019re going to repay the debt and not renew it, or what\u2019s your thoughts on that?","Kevin Wampler","Well obviously our current credit facility expires in February of 2013, so the term loan is now less than a year to maturity so it automatically moves from long-term to current liability on the balance sheet.  Obviously we will look to renew that at some point within the year and prior to expiration.  We believe it makes sense to have a line of credit available, even though we\u2019ve traditionally had cash on the balance sheet.  So that will be a process that we will go through, and once that happens we\u2019ll obviously announce that and get that out to everybody.  But that will be a normal process we will go through.","Joseph Parkhill \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.  And then just on the CAPEX side as well over the last two years, you\u2019ve had a little bit more elevated as you\u2019ve built out more distribution centers.  Is there kind of a run rate as to how frequently you\u2019ll need new distribution centers in the future and how you think about CAPEX on an ongoing, longer term basis?","Kevin Wampler","Well I think as we look at our distribution centers, some of these buildings we\u2019re just now adding larger second shifts and third shifts to, so we continue to work more efficiency into the network.  So that plays a role in being able to offset the need for an additional distribution center.  Obviously we\u2019ve been building a lot of stores in the northeast the last few years.  They tend to be very high volume stores, so the northeast makes sense that we need to a get new distribution center in that area. ","Part of it depends on growth, part of it depends upon\u2014again, smoothing of inventory is another way that we can gain efficiencies within our network, and so we continue to look at that.  I think, again, size plays a part in it, so when we look at a new distribution center, we always look at size versus stem miles because obviously when you have a bigger building, you can serve more stores, but are your stem miles going to be efficient for you in the long term?  So there\u2019s a lot of different factors that go into it, and then part of it is just regionalization.  You know, sometimes we grow stronger in certain areas of the country that can create needs maybe prior than it would other areas.  So all those things go into consideration.  ","You know, the typical building\u2014we have buildings that probably service 300, 400 stores, and we have some buildings that service closer to 800 stores, so that kind of gives you an idea \u2013 you know, the 400 to 800 range is kind of a general range of stores being serviced by a building \u2013 gives you an idea based on growth what may be kind of the cadence at the end of the day, so that you could potentially need one every three to four years.","Joseph Parkhill \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Hey, morning Bob.  I had a question \u2013 how important are carbonated beverages for Dollar Tree in driving traffic?  And the reason I\u2019m asking, obviously, is with Family Dollar adding Pepsi products and we\u2019re anticipating some pretty hot pricing for Pepsi products over the Memorial Day weekend from Family Dollar; and I believe with Dollar Tree that the size of your Coke bottles are a little bit smaller than they were in the past.  I\u2019m just kind of curious as to how that could impact Dollar Tree.","Bob Sasser","Well, carbonated beverages are very important to us at Dollar Tree \u2013 it\u2019s a huge business.  We sell a private brand or a control label.  We sell a lot of it.  We also sell the single-serve Coke and Pepsi products at the fronts of our store.  We are very pleased with our Pepsi-Coke sales.  We think we offer for a buck the best value in the market.  Now, you may find somebody running promotions here and there and trying to drive some sales on that.  For us, it\u2019s more of an impulse.  We get customers in the store.  We have them in the refrigerated cases at the front of the store.  It\u2019s a buck, it\u2019s a big bottle of Pepsi, and it\u2019s a great value on Coke.  And so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve answered your question well, but we really don\u2019t see other people\u2019s Memorial Day promotions as really threatening that business.  It\u2019s more of an impulse category for us.  It\u2019s a big one, but it\u2019s not something that\u2014it\u2019s not a destination, let\u2019s go to blank store and buy our 12-pack or 24-pack of Coke or Pepsi.  That\u2019s not how we use it.  It\u2019s basically at our price point an impulse buy, and we like both those guys and we do a lot of business with both of them.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Yeah.  My other question \u2013 what is your view on long-term gross margin opportunities for Dollar Tree?  I recognize that every year, your initial markups improve.  It sounds like your ocean freight contract for the next 12 months is favorable, and then further you always tell us that you don\u2019t want to become another small-box grocery store.  But at the same time, this consumable mix continues to grow every year, just as it does for Dollar General and Family Dollar.  So are you thinking that gross margin rate is not really an opportunity, instead where the opportunities on the gross profit dollars just driving higher volume, so more of a flat long-term margin rate outlook?","Bob Sasser","You know, Dan, we look at both of them, and if you look back at our history, I think it\u2019s remarkable \u2013 I use the word remarkable \u2013 but we\u2019ve always said that we were in control of our margins, and when pricing was favorable we would maybe take some into margin, but we\u2019re just as likely to put more value into the product and drive more top line.  Also over the past several years, we have been responding to consumer needs and selling more of the things they need and building bigger stores and all that.  But if you look back at the last 10 years of our history, it really is a remarkably tight range that our gross profit has performed at.  If you look back at the last 10 years\u2014now first quarter, we were 35% gross profit this year.  Last year, we were 35%.  If you look back at the last 10 years, the high was 35.6 and the low was 33.4 in 2006, with the average being about 34.6, so we\u2019re just a little higher\u2014just short of the high range of our gross profit percent.  But over 10 years, you think about the changes in diesel fuel prices and you think about the changes in cost of goods up and down, and the mix changes and the larger stores and the more consumable products that we\u2019ve added, and we\u2019ve still managed that gross profit number in just a very tight range.  And if you look at our operating margin, we just posted the highest operating margin percent in the history of the Company at 10.9%.","So I believe strongly that we\u2019re going to be able to manage our gross profit percent going forward.  Could you jump out there and make one year higher?  Probably; but our strategy really is more along the line of offering the most value to the customer for one dollar and to deliver the margin that we need for our shareholders.  So in doing that, if you look at that 35% range, maybe a few higher, maybe a little lower, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re managing the value of the offering to the customer.  That drives top line growth, and when we drive top line growth, we can leverage our SG&A and all the other fixed costs.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Right.  Okay, I think I understand what you\u2019re saying.  Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys.  What is the best way to kind of think about SG&A growth and SG&A per-store growth?  I mean, is there a right way to think about it, because there is maybe a little bit more volatility to that line item than I guess I would have expected, given how consistent the sales trends have really been.","Kevin Wampler","Well you know, Scot, as we kind of walked through the various positives and helps and hurts, I guess, for the quarter on our SG&A, I know sometimes\u2014you know, we don\u2019t look at it as SG&A dollars by square foot or anything like that.  We\u2019re basically looking at it as running our business, trying to be as efficient as possible, continuing to try to drive cost out of the business as appropriate.  So those are the kind of things that we think about, and so you\u2019re going to have some ebbs and flows based upon all those things at the end of the day.  We look at it as are we continuing to leverage it as a percent of sales, are we continuing to be able to push down those costs and gain efficiencies within our business; and I think that\u2019s what we always look at and drive towards.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks.  And then this is a little bit of a sidebar, but can you guys talk\u2014I guess you guys are starting to experiment with selling prescription drugs in, I guess it\u2019s the Deals chain.  Can you talk about that at all?","Bob Sasser","Well, there\u2019s not a lot to talk about, but we do have one store in Florida in the south Florida area, a Deals store, that we have partnered with a third party and we have a pharmacy.  It\u2019s been a very short period of time, and it\u2019s one store.  We may try it in another store, too, but it\u2019s clearly in the test mode and it\u2019s so early, I really don\u2019t have anything to report other than, again, we\u2019re always about trying new things and pushing the envelope on what we can offer to our customers and what they want.  So this falls into that category, but right now it\u2019s one store for just a very short period of time, and I really don\u2019t have anything.  I\u2019d tell you, but I don\u2019t have anything much to report.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hey, good morning everyone.  Nice quarter.  I want to ask a follow-up question on IMU.  In the past, you\u2019ve highlighted that the lift you got from initial markup was often sufficient enough to offset the negative drag from mix, and then you\u2019d of course finally get some benefit from occupancy leverage.  Are you still in a position right now where that benefit from IMU is offsetting the mix drag on gross margin?","Bob Sasser","Well, I can only speak to it from the standpoint of pointing to the operating margin; and remember, our price is still a dollar.  Other than our Deals stores, our price is still a dollar, so our markup on what we sell for a dollar by category is favorable.  When you start selling more of the consumer products, the mix does put pressure on the gross margin, but then we get the leverage on the fixed costs.  So it really is about driving the most value possible to the customer at the dollar price point and delivering that improved operating margin.  10.9% - again, I\u2019ve said it three times, we\u2019re proud of that.  It\u2019s the highest first quarter operating margin we\u2019ve ever had, and by the way that\u2019s the highest first quarter penetration of the consumer products that we\u2019ve had.  So you can do both \u2013 it\u2019s not just markup and it\u2019s not just top line.  It\u2019s really both together that provides the quality of earnings that we\u2019re after.","Plus, in this time and age that we\u2019re in, our customers want\u2014we serve our customers, we\u2019re going to sell them what they need, what they want.  And I\u2019ll just say this, too \u2013 as the economy improves\u2014and this has been a trend for several years.  This isn\u2019t just a first quarter trend.  But as the economy improves, we\u2019re going to do very well also because we do have a terrific mix of variety merchandise at higher margins, and it will be the same thought process but it\u2019s just a little bit different calculation as we drive more variety sales to the mix of consumer products.","So that\u2019s the secret formula.  It\u2019s not really that secret, but initial markup is important, top line growth is important, and how we manage our costs and our fixed costs as well as our variable costs is how we get to the bottom line.","Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thank you.  I guess talking about one of your sales drivers, you are clearly enthusiastic about the coolers and the freezers.  I guess I\u2019m curious on why you may not be accelerating that roll-out.  As you stand here today, you only have those in about 50% of the stores, and it seems like the roll-out is only keeping pace with store growth.  Why not kick that up a bunch, maybe even double it for the next couple of years?","Bob Sasser","Well you know, we do what we think is the proper amount of installations.  We are in some locations restricted by our leases, and there are some locations\u2014you can\u2019t do it in some places.  There are some locations that the demographics aren\u2019t as favorable.  Believe it or not, I mean, there are some places where we\u2019ve installed and it hasn\u2019t done as well as it has in other places, so we\u2019ve learned where the best demographics are.  There are store size implications \u2013 you know, as you get below that 9,000 or 8,000 square foot store especially, you begin to pinch the assortment and you really don\u2019t have the room, either on the sales floor for it or in the backroom for it.  So there are some natural limitations to that.","We are installing them in new stores that we open if they fit our model, if it fits the model of that new store with the demographics and the size and the volume and the delivery availability, so we are putting them into new stores.  We think we are going at the proper rate.  ","We do like it \u2013 you\u2019re exactly right, and the stores where we have frozen refrigerated, sales per square foot are higher.  Those are usually our largest stores.  The average store size in those stores are larger.  Our average sales in those stores are higher, and our cash contribution margin\u2014our cash contribution is higher in those stores.  So we like everything about the frozen and refrigeration; it just has some natural limitations, and then there are some limitations as we roll it out based on store size.  And the delivery \u2013 we\u2019ve built this delivery model over time, too, so part and parcel to being able to do it from a restriction standpoint is, by the way, can you efficiently deliver the product to the store and make a few bucks doing it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for a couple more questions.  With that, we\u2019ll go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks, good morning.  I noticed that home products beat out food snacks and beverage as the top performing category in the quarter.  Is this switch something that should have been more apparent in the gross margin, or is there not really that much variance year-over-year?  And then secondly, can you just talk to the slight increase in shrink that you mentioned in your prepared remarks?  Thanks.","Bob Sasser","The mix, Matt \u2013 home products is one that we\u2019ve really been staking our claim to over the past several years, and it continues to grow.  Now, there is a mix \u2013 when you talk about home products from a margin standpoint, it\u2019s a little bit of both.  You\u2019ve got home products in regard to household cleaning supplies and paper towels and bath tissue that are fast-turning and lower margin, and then you\u2019ve got home products like some of the tabletop merchandise \u2013 the placemats, the dishcloths, and the flatware \u2013 and those type products that are higher margin variety products.  So you\u2019ve got a little bit of both in that home product category.  It\u2019s a huge category for us.  It\u2019s one that we think that we want to stake a claim to because it appeals to the broad middle America, and it\u2019s one that we think we can do well at not only the dollar price point but also in our Deals stores.  We think it\u2019s an important category, so that\u2019s really the story there.  As it appeals to our customers, it\u2019s important and it brings in footsteps with a part of the mix and it makes a lot of money with the other.","Kevin Wampler","And Matt, in regards to shrink, we did mention that it was up slightly.  It was just slightly, but over the last two years we have been at a level that was a record low level for us, so obviously it\u2019s something that we\u2019re keeping our eye on, and our field teams and our loss prevention teams are very focused on.  But again, it\u2019s early in the year.  We\u2019re only about a little over 30% reconciled our inventory for this year of our stores, so we have a good opportunity to continue to bring that back into line.  But for Q1, it was up just slightly.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, it\u2019s Dan Binder.  Good morning.  I had a question regarding the events and what\u2019s new in this coming quarter versus last year, whether it\u2019s Dollar Day events or anything else that might be incremental year-over-year that you can give us color on.","Bob Sasser","You know, I can give you some color, Dan, on where we are right now.  We\u2019re past Mother\u2019s Day and full-blown into graduation sales, with graduation balloons and parties and all that goes with that.  If you look at Dollar Tree stores up front, you\u2019re going to see a really terrific assortment of summer items for summer fun.  You\u2019ve got water blasters for a buck, 26-inch water blasters.  We have a new item\u2014we\u2019ve done well with our solar stakes \u2013 for only a dollar, can you believe that?  You buy solar stakes, and for the Memorial Day through the Fourth of July time period, we\u2019ve got some that have the red, white and blue on them, so you can be patriotic and light up your sidewalk all at the same time.  Of course, with this time of year, a lot of things around Memorial Day with glow sticks and barbecue items and paper goods and paper plates; and water \u2013 you know, we\u2019ve got terrific values on our beverage.  So it\u2019s all about summer fun and pools and going to the beach and having fun right now at Dollar Tree, and if you haven\u2019t been in our store lately, you should probably stop by.","In our Deals stores, in addition to all the summer fun, we are also selling fans, for example.  You know, you can\u2019t sell an electric fan at Dollar Tree for a buck, but you can in our Deals stores and we\u2019re having terrific success with stand fans and other kinds of electric fans.  As soon as the weather really turns hot, I expect that business to pop in our Deals stores.  Right now, we\u2019re again selling 24-packs of water and little cooler and beach bags, and all the things in Deals for going to the beach or having fun in the summertime, or picnics or that type of thing.","So that\u2019s what\u2019s going on right now.  There is always something new at Dollar Tree.  You know, we\u2019ll come out of the summer, we\u2019ll go into back-to-school as usual, and I\u2019m not going to give you all our secrets right now but I can tell you back-to-school this year will be the best ever.  It just will.  We\u2019re excited about that, and of course after back-to-school you\u2019re right back into the fall and Halloween and getting into the holiday season again.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question today from David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","Yes, thank you.  In terms of Dollar Giant, can you talk a little bit about the sales trends there?  I know you talked last year that you had some headwinds from the transition.  And then also, can you talk about anything you\u2019ve gleaned from the inventory and sales data in terms of how you think you\u2019ll change the assortments in certain categories.","Bob Sasser","Yeah, as you can imagine, sales are under pressure.  Now that we know what we\u2019re selling and we know what our inventory is by SKU, by store, we\u2019re going through and rationalizing these assortments.  You\u2019re trying to get rid of some of the existing products, so you\u2019re selling down on that; and in the meantime, there\u2019s little voids between getting rid of the old and getting in the new.  You know, all stores don\u2019t sell down at the same rate.  We\u2019re getting it in stock in the DCs, we\u2019re delivering\u2014changing the delivery model so that we can get it from source to DC to store more efficiently up there, and we\u2019re excited about what\u2019s going there.  We\u2019ve just started relays in six of our stores up there to really change the flow of the product to more like a\u2014and change the name of the stores to Dollar Tree from Dollar Giant.","So what you\u2019re seeing right now is just a lot of activity around building the store teams, about building the merchandise assortment, getting rid of some of the old, replacing it with higher value merchandise from our Dollar Tree assortment.  Not that it wasn\u2019t a great value before, but with our buying power we are able to provide even more value for a $1.25 in our Dollar Giant stores. ","So you\u2019ve got a headwind to sales right now.  Margin is probably neutral\u2014margin rate is probably neutral, and a headwind on SG&A because we\u2019re investing in the business.  We\u2019re doing store relays, we\u2019re investing in all the things to put the infrastructure in place so that we can provide the platform for future profitable growth.  ","Just a look at the cadence \u2013 we expect headwinds all first half in our Canada business.  We expect it to get better in the second half.  I can\u2019t quantify it, but I can tell you that first half is planned to be a lot of activity, a lot of investment and time and effort in getting the stores and the merchandise assortments right, and then showing some improvement in the second half.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question and answer session.

Participating on today's call will be our President and CEO, Gary Philbin; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent 8-K, 10-Q and Annual Report, which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so. ","As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was comprised of 14 weeks as part of our 53 week fiscal year. The extra week in 2017 contributed $406.6 million to sales and $0.21 to diluted EPS. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company incurred several discreet charges, including a 2.73 billion non-cash charge for goodwill impairment, a $40 million inventory mark-down reserve related to the Family Dollar segment, a $13 million non-cash impairment of certain store assets, and a $1.5 million acceleration in non-cash deferred financing charges associated with debt prepayment. ","The fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 includes the following discrete items; a $35 million recovery related to the Dollar Express settlement, a $12.6 million charge for an increase in the workers\u2019 comp reserve, and a $9.8 million acceleration in non-cash deferred financing costs. These items are detailed in the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in today\u2019s earnings release. Unless otherwise noted, our margin, net income, and earnings comparisons presented today exclude the impact of these discrete items for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. ","At the end of the prepared remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Now we\u2019ll turn the call over to Gary Philbin, Dollar Tree\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. ","Gary Philbin","Thank you Randy and good morning everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were strong for both banners. Our results demonstrate the increasing strength of the Dollar Tree brand and accelerated progress on the Family Dollar turnaround, as Family Dollar delivered its strongest quarterly same-store sales growth of the year. Our merchants at both banners have delivered a 2019 plan that we believe overcomes the effect of most tariffs at the 25% level and provides opportunity in the back half of the year if tariffs are not increased. ","In Q3, we had announced plans to renovate at least 1,000 Family Dollar stores in 2019. These renovated stores will include new price-impact sections including $1 Dollar Tree merchandise assortments. Approximately 200 Family Dollar stores will be re-bannered to Dollar Tree. We accelerated our Family Dollar closings in Q4, closing 84 stores, as we are aggressively optimizing our store fleet to gain traction towards our inflection points. We plan to close as many as 390 Family Dollar stores this year. Excluding the discrete charges, the combined company performed well for the quarter. ","Our results for the fourth quarter included sales that were 6.21 billion at the top end of our guidance range, excluding the 14th week from the prior years\u2019 quarter. Sales increased 4.2%. Consolidated same-store sales increased 2.4%, up from the 1% in Q3. And by segment, the Dollar Tree segment delivered a positive 3.2 comp and Family Dollar same store sales increased 1.4. This was the strongest quarterly comp in 2018 for Family Dollar and on a two year stack basis represented an acceleration of 130 basis points from Q3. ","On a GAAP basis, diluted loss per share was $9.66. On an adjusted basis, excluding the discrete items Randy outlined for Q4, diluted EPS was $1.93 within the high end of our guidance range. This was an increase over the prior years\u2019 adjusted $1.89 per share in the 14-week period. Excluding the $0.21 per share from the extra week and last year\u2019s Q4, the adjusted EPS increase was 14.9%. ","I consider the Dollar Tree brand to be the most unique, differentiated, and defensible business model of the US value retail sector, evidenced by achieving our 44th consecutive quarter that\u2019s every quarter since 2007 of positive comps without moving our price point. Customers continue to choose Dollar Tree for the values they are able to get for only $1 for every item, leading our sector in operating margin at 12.8% for fiscal 2018, and delivering extremely consistent gross margin performance. ","Through all types of environments and cost scenarios nine out of the past 10 years including 2018, Dollar Tree\u2019s annual gross margin has been in our sweet spot between 35% and 36%. Values, assortments, categories, product introductions, product specs have all improved , but mostly importantly our customer loyalty to the Dollar Tree brand continues to grow. Our merchandizing team, which recently returned from another successful overseas buying trip is second to none in sourcing high quality, great value products while managing and protecting product margins. ","You\u2019ve heard us say it before, we are in control of our margins even with a fixed price point. Since the Family Dollar acquisition, we have taken the necessary actions to stabilize the business, capture synergies in both brands, rebuild the leadership team, introduce and develop assured services infrastructure, integrate system, create smart ways for our customers to save, improve on store standards, invest in labor and price, and importantly to repay more than $4 billion worth of debt earning our investment grade rating. ","We are now at the stage to be able to invest in and reposition the Family Dollar brand for future success through an acceleration of renovations, re-banners, and store closings. As demonstrated by our improved sales performance, our strategy to optimize the Family Dollar real estate portfolio is delivering results. We\u2019re seeing meaningful improvement in operational performance across the foot print of renovated Family Dollar stores and those that we have re-bannered to Dollar Tree. Our fourth quarter comp performance of positive 1.4 was the strongest of the year. We are excited with the results of our renovation program, both with traffic and the diversity of locations. And as announced at the end of Q3, we are accelerating this initiative in 2019. ","As new and renovated stores become more significant part of the store base, we expect these stores to contribute more to our topline comps and store sales productivity. Our renovations over the past two quarters continue to outperform earlier versions and we are delivering average comp lifts exceeding 10%. We accelerated store closing of underperforming Family Dollar stores with 84 in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2018, we renovated 522 Family Dollar stores, re-bannered 52 stores in to the Dollar Tree brand, and closed 122 underperforming Family Dollar stores.","Given the results we\u2019re seeing from our store optimization initiative, we are confident that it will allow to drive substantial improvement in the quality of performance of the Family Dollar portfolio and create long term value. In fiscal 2019 at Family Dollar, we plan to complete at least 1,000 store renovations and 200 re-banners. We are further accelerating store closings and expect to close as many as 390 under-performing stores, and because of age, layout, location and favorable lease terms or other factors we\u2019re now expected to provide an adequate return on investment for the cost of renovation. The final number of actual stores to closures will be affected by ongoing lease negotiations. ","Sales highlights for the fourth quarter; Dollar Tree saw balance increases of both traffic and ticket. At Family Dollar, ticket was up and traffic was down for the quarter. Importantly, Family Dollar\u2019s traffic comp improved 120 basis points from Q3. Geographically, all regions for both banners comp positively. Our cadence of comps through the quarter, November represents the softest comp month across both segments; December was the best monthly comp for Dollar Tree as the merchandising team delivered on seasonal assortment and impact. While January was the strongest month at Family Dollar benefiting from a strong start to the month and early release of (inaudible). ","Dollar Tree continues to deliver solid relatively balanced positive comps in both consumable and discretionary side to the business. The consumables business drove traffic and sales at Family Dollar with comps exceeding 2.5%. Discretionary sales come negatively of Family Dollar improved more than a 100 basis points from Q3. ","At Dollar Tree Canada, the team delivered mid-single digit positive comps for the quarter and for the year, with increases in both traffic and ticket. Traffic was a bit stronger in Q4 than it was in Q3. Consumables comp outperformed discretionary. Top performing categories included fruit, floral, beverages and Christmas seasonal and Canada team achieved its operating income plan for both the quarter and the year.","For Dollar Tree Direct, our loyalty club membership now surpasses 1 million members. We\u2019ve produced or mailed 700,000 holiday catalogs to our existing and prospective customers. Dollartree Direct is much more than a selling website. It\u2019s communicating with and enhancing the relationship with our most loyal customers. And we continue the momentum in our Family Dollar app and smart coupon program, that\u2019s more than 8.8 million customers have not opted in to the program. Smart coupon continue to provide our shoppers with the value that builds loyalty and provides us with greater customer insight allowing it to merchandise even more effectively.","For real estate in the fourth quarter, we opened a total of 143 new stores, 83 Dollar Tree, 60 Family Dollar. We relocated or expanded 14 stores, 10 Dollar Tree, 4 Family Dollar. We renovated 34 Family Dollar stores as part of the renovation initiative and we\u2019ve re-bannered four more Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree for a total of over 196 projects during the quarter. We completed 522 Family Dollar renovations in fiscal 2018; we\u2019ve also added freezers and coolers in to 95 Dollar Tree stores during the fourth quarter, bringing our total of Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 5664. And during the quarter we closed 94 stores and 10 Dollar Tree and the 84 Family Dollar stores. We ended the year with 15,237 stores, 7,001 being Dollar Tree, 8,236 Family Dollar. ","Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I\u2019d like to provide you an update on tariffs as they mentioned on our call last quarter. Our merchandizing teams for both players have done an extraordinary job in tariff mitigation. While the increase in section 301 tariffs from 10% to 25% as of March 1 has been postponed, we will continue to monitor the situation. The outlook Kevin will share is based on tariffs going to 25% as was the expectation when we built our annual business plan and bought product to the back half of the year. If tariffs do not increase, we could see margin opportunity primarily in the back, but we\u2019ll provide updates as the situation evolves. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our Q4 and our initial outlook for 2019. Kevin.","Kevin Wampler","Thank you, Gary and good morning. Total sale for the fourth quarter was $6.21 billion comprised of $3.31 billion at Dollar Tree and 2.90 billion at Family Dollar. Excluding the 406.6 million in sales from the 14 week in the prior years\u2019 quarter, sales increased to 4.2%. Enterprise same store sales increased to 2.4% on a constant currency basis or 2.3% when adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations. ","On a segment basis, same store sales for the Dollar Tree segment increased 3.2% or 3.1% when adjusted for Canadian currency and the Family Dollar comp increased to 1.4%. Overall gross profit for the quarter was $1.91 billion compared to $2.1 billion in the prior years\u2019 14 week quarter. As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased to 30.8% compared to 33% in the prior year. ","Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 37.1% for the fourth quarter, a 90 basis points decline compared with the prior years\u2019 fourth quarter. The decline as a percentage of sales was primarily due to 45 basis points of higher occupancy costs, deleveraging from cycling the extra week in the prior years\u2019 quarter. 35 basis points of merchandise cost including freight as higher freight cost were partially offset by improved mark-on and a positive effect of product makes a strong seasonal merchandize sale and 10 basis points of increased strength. ","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 23.6% during the fourth quarter, compared with 27.6% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to mark-downs which increased approximately 210 basis points. This increase included a 140 basis points or $40 million reserve for SKU rationalization, as well as increased promotional and seasonal mark-downs and lower mark gain allowances during the quarter. ","Merchandise cost including freight increased approximately 85 basis points, driven primarily by an increase in freight expense, offset by slightly higher initial mark-up. Occupancy costs increased approximately 45 basis points, primarily due to the deleveraging effect of the additional sales from the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. Shrink increase approximately 35 basis points due to unfavorable inventory results in the current year quarter and from changes in accrual rate. And distribution cost increased 25 basis points. ","Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter increased 50 basis points to 21.5% from 21% in the same quarter last year. Prior year included a 35 million repayment of the Dollar Express receivable written off earlier in 2017. Excluding the repayment, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 21.5% in the prior years' quarter. ","Fourth quarter SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales improved to 20.7% compared to 21.1% from prior year\u2019s quarter. The improvement was primarily due to lower incentive compensation and workers compensation costs, partially offset by a 20 basis points increase in store dollar apparel expenses resulting from the planned tax reinvestment. Excluding discreet charges, SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 22%, compared to 20.8% in the prior years\u2019 quarter. Excluding the 35 million Dollar Express settlement in the prior quarter, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22%. ","Payroll expenses increased approximately 28 basis points primarily as a result of an increase store hourly and field management payroll in connection with the planned reinvestment of income tax savings partially offset by a lower incentive compensation and other performance based compensation. ","Depreciation and amortization improved 20 basis points while excluding the $10.8 million store level impairment charges partially offset by the de-leveraging effect of the additional sales from our 53rd week in fiscal 2017. On a consolidated basis, adjusted operating income was $632.6 million compared with $743.2 million in the same period last year, which included one extra week and operating income largely was 10.2% compared to 11.7% in last years\u2019 fourth quarter. ","Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 50 basis points to 16.4% compared to the prior years\u2019 14 week quarter. Adjusted operating income largely for the Family Dollar segment was 3% for the quarter. Now on operating expense for the quarter totaled $46.7 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. ","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 5.1% compared to a benefit of 50.4% in the prior year period. The rate in 2018 is a result of the goodwill impairment charge not being tax deductible. The prior benefit was a result of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act which totaled the benefit of approximately $583.7 million. ","For the fourth quarter, net loss including discreet charges was $2.31 billion and GAAP diluted loss per share was $9.66, compared to diluted earnings per share of $4.37 in the prior year\u2019s quarter. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings increased 2.1% to $1.93 compared to an adjusted $1.89 in the prior years\u2019 14 week quarter. Excluding the $0.21 per share benefit from the extra week in 2017, adjusted earnings per share increased 14.9%. ","Combined cash and cash equivalents at fiscal year-end totaled $422.1 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. On January 18, 2019, the company repaid its $782 million term loan facility. As part of the pre-payment the company accelerated 1.5 million of deferred financing cost which were included in interest expense in the fourth quarter. Our outstanding debt as on February 2, 2019 was $4.3 billion, a decrease of $1.4 billion from the prior year end.","Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 11.4% from the same time last year, while selling square foot increased to 5.3%. Inventory for selling square foot increased 5.8%. The increase reflects the acceleration of our receipts of certain import goods to minimize the impact of increased tariffs. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings and sales initiatives for the first quarter. ","Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end increase 11.7% for the same period last year increased 10.8% on a selling square foot basis. Capital expenditures were $194.4 million in the fourth quarter versus $182.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. But for fiscal 2019, we\u2019re planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion. Capital expenditures will be focused on 550 new stores, 350 of which will be Dollar Tree, 200 Family Dollar, along with at least 1,000 Family Dollar renovations and 200 re-banners. The addition of frozen or refrigerated capability to a total of 500 new and existing Dollar Tree stores, the expansion of frozen or refrigerated capability to 400 Family Dollar stores, and the addition of adult beverage to 1,000 stores. ","IT system enhancements and projects, installation of LED lighting in approximately 3000 stores, and the completion of construction of a new Dollar Tree banner distribution center in (inaudible) County, Ohio, as well as the start of construction of a new DC 16, and additional automation projects. Both new DCs will have co-bannered capabilities. Depreciation and amortization totaled $166.7 million for the fourth quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $156.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. ","For fiscal 2019, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $635 million to $645 million. Our initial outlook for fiscal 2019 includes the following assumptions; our guidance is based on the expectation that Section 301 tariffs would move to 25% in March of 2019. If these tariffs do not move to 25%, we expect to see margin benefit in the second half of fiscal 2019. Calendar considerations for the year include the following; Easter will be three weeks later in 2019, which should benefit Q1 sales, and there will be six fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will negatively impact Q4 sales. ","Our guidance does include expenses in connection with the effects of our store-optimization program. It does not include charges for lease obligation expense for any closed stores, which would be negotiated in fiscal 2019. We expect to incur $37 million related to consolidating our store support centers, and we expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets and states increasing minimum wages. We expect year-over-year freight cost as a percentage of sales to increase in the first half of the year, and then flattened out in the second half. ","Diesel is currently expected to be a benefit for the year. Net interest expense will be approximately $415 billion in Q1, and approximately $153 million for fiscal 2019. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations and we'll not adjust our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 22.9% for the first quarter and 22.6% for fiscal 2019. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 239.1 million shares for Q1 and 239.4 million shares for the full year. ","For the first quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.74 billion to $5.85 billion and diluted earnings per share to range of $1.05 to $1.15. These estimates are based on a low-single digit same-store sales increase. For fiscal 2019, we are forecasting total sales to range from $23.45 billion to $23.87 billion based on a low-single digit same-store sales increase, and approximately 1% selling square foot growth. Company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for the full fiscal year 2019 will range between $4.85 and $5.25, which includes costs of $95 million or $0.31 per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 are also burdened by approximately $0.18 due to the expected tax rate being 22.6% as compared to 19.9% excluding the goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018. ","The $95 million in discrete costs are related to the following initiatives; 37 million of store support center consolidation costs; 30 million of incremental initiative costs based on project count and velocity\u2019 and 28 million of store closure costs which as noted does not include any lease obligation expense we would negotiate. These discrete costs are expected to be incurred disproportionately, as approximately 75% will be incurred in the first half and 25% in the second half of fiscal 2019, as the company targets completing a majority of initiative projects by the end of august 2019. ","Due to the costs associated with these initiatives year-over-year operating income is expected to be lower in the first half of fiscal 2019, but it is expected to show material improvement in the second half as these initiatives gain traction. Additionally, we believe that these initiatives will drive business and provide a platform for an accelerated improvement in earnings in fiscal 2020, when the company's earnings per share is expected to grow 14% to 18% over reported fiscal 2019 earnings per share. ","I'll now turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Philbin","Thanks Kevin. Before turning to Q&A, I'd like to highlight the continued progress we are making with Family Dollar. On the Q3 call, we shared an update on the integration process, our success in building a common foundation across the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners, and our development of the renovation model that is generating returns we're looking for. We have since received very positive feedback from many investors, and we are confident we are on track to reaching an inflection point as we continue to optimize the store fleet of Family Dollar throughout 2019. ","In addition to synergies, it's important to recognize the profound impact of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands have had on each other, and the meaningful value this creates for our shareholders now and into their the future. But the benefits of the merger have not just been for the Family Dollar brand, Dollar Tree has benefited too. The stores we have re-bannered from Family Dollar are performing well, and have improved Dollar Tree's overall profitability, a trend that should continue as we re-banner more stores. ","The Dollar Tree banner has also benefited from indirect procurement. We estimate we have saved more than 55 million. We've also used our scale of more than 15,000 combined (inaudible) to drive merchandise cost savings exceeding $70 million. Family Dollar, we've driven more than 145 million in estimated savings for indirect procurement, and more than 100 million in cost of sales. In particular as a result of our scale we have decreased Family Dollar's initial merchandise costs by approximately 153 basis points, since 2015. The lower merchandise costs have allowed us to partially offset higher distribution costs, shrink and higher freight and fuel costs. ","Overall Family Dollar, we've taken the savings and reinvested in the business to drive traffic and loyalty by lowering prices at stores and increasing staff to improve shopper experience. Our portfolio optimization strategy is generating performance improvements across Family Dollar, and we are accelerating the program in fiscal 2019 and beyond. We have identified high performing stores, the stores that will benefit from renovation and under-performing stores some that can be better at Dollar Tree and others that because of age, layout, location, (inaudible) lease terms or other factors may not benefit from either. These are what we have grouped to potentially close. ","As I noted earlier, we have developed and tested a new model for renovated Family Dollar stores, which we are calling H2. I spoke about this on our previous call, but I want to give you a little more color on why it's performing so well. Our H2 model has a better shopping adjacencies, more productive end-caps, a greater number of freezers and coolers, which allows to offer more consumables and better serve the mid-week shopping (inaudible) needs of our customers. It\u2019s performance has also been enhanced by the introduction of Dollar Tree $1 merchandise throughout the store. ","This last touch has been very successful in driving traffic to these stores, many of which are in (inaudible) locations, where a Dollar Tree would not be as successful. Our H2 stores are generating increased traffic and strong comp store sales in excess of 10% over control stores, with actual comp store sales in excess of 13%. This new design has shown strong performance in a variety of locations, especially in locations where we have been the most challenged. As we said in November, we plan to renovate more than 1000 of these stores in 2019, with an accelerated schedule in future years. We also plan to re-banner approximately 200 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores this year, opening 350 new Dollar Trees and 200 new Family Dollars. ","We will be accelerating our store closings in the fourth quarter of 2018, with 384 stores that we mentioned. In 2019, we will close as many of 390, subject to ongoing lease negotiations. This higher level of store closures in Q4 and anticipated store changes in 2019, result in $40 million in incremental mark-downs during the quarter. However, in conjunction with our new store openings, our renovations, and conversions to Dollar Tree, we are confident that these actions will result in an improved portfolio of Family Dollar stores that will set the stage for stronger, long term performance. ","In addition to optimizing the Family Dollar portfolio, we plan to add adult beverage in approximately 1000 stores, expand freezers and coolers in 400 stores, and continue to improve the Family Dollar merchandising strategy. Some of these improvements will not be implemented until the middle or end of 2019, but we believe we'll demonstrate the potential of Family Dollar by the end of 2019. We are keenly focused on a proposal to enhance future value-creation for our shareholders. ","As our long term investors know we have never been shy of testing different options at Dollar Tree, we have explored introducing multiple price points in the past ranging from our Oops test to our larger experiment we ran with Dollar Tree deals. And as we can see, with our H2 renovations at Family Dollar, we've effectively tested the opposite introducing a broader range of Dollar\u2019s price point items to the multi-price point format. The fact is the model works very well. ","Dollar Tree, one of the most unique, differentiated, defensible models in value retail has an extremely loyal customer base, our previous testing of this concept has demonstrated that everything's at the Dollar is an incredible powerful part of our value proposition, and lets us drive industry leading margins delivering 44 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales. To be clear, our efforts over the long term have been to protect and grow the brand, deliver the wow factor for our customers, and increase value to our shareholders, part of what is regularly taking a look at that idea and introducing multiple price points at Dollar Tree. ","We are open to testing again, and the fact is, with where we are in the integration of Family Dollar, our co-banner DCs afford us the capability to do so, and so we are thoughtfully and carefully playing our test in specific locations, serviced by our co-banner DCs. Our initial efforts will be to test unique assortment within these Dollar Tree stores, understand our customer research, and develop a scalable model. As always our brand is our most valuable asset around any test we do. All I can say for now is more to come on this. ","We are also benefiting from the initiative we took to upgrade our Family Dollar (inaudible) 1brand program in Q2 of 2018, we completed the roll-out program of moving away from Family gourmet and Family Dollar brands to introduce products under a range of private brands including (inaudible) candy, Chestnut Hill, Driver's Choice, Tool Bench, Nature's Measure and many others. As a result of these improvements to our private brand program, the growth in these categories has been strong driving both top line sales, improved margins and customer loyalty. ","I want to give you a brief update on our integration of support functions with the primary exception of merchandise, store operations and loss prevention, all other functions and departments have been fully integrated. This includes with some minor exceptions outlined in the press release, real estate, supply chain, strategic planning, global sourcing, all IT functions, strategy and operation support, finance, human resource, inventory management and legal departments. To date, this has resulted in savings of over $50 million. ","We are continuing to make great progress on the consolidation of bringing all these teams together under one roof, with a new support center in Chesapeake, Virginia. This last piece of the integration which will improve our ability to support both banners, through enhanced collaboration, communication, and team work. We expect that to be completed by July and will generate an additional $15 million in savings once complete. ","Regarding our capital allocation plans, as you know we maintain a responsible approach to capital allocation to position the company for future success. Since the acquisition, we have well outperformed our synergy targets and have made significant debt pay-downs, including $782 million term loan facility in Q4, for a total of approximately 4.3 billion, since completing the acquisition, and earned investment grade ratings from both S&P Global and Moody's. ","Moving forward, we believe we'll generate sufficient free cash flow to cover our investment needs. The company has an existing $1 billion Board authorization to repurchase shares, and we'll continue to evaluate share repurchases in 2019. And we will continue to assess capital allocation with share buyback opportunity ahead of us. This quarter's results along with a broader work to improve performance at Family Dollar, give us confidence that our strategy of thoughtful planning and careful execution will drive value for shareholders over the long term. We do this with the support of our highly engaged and recently refreshed Board, now five new independent directors in the last 2.5 years. We will continue executing on our plans so that all Dollar Tree shareholders realize the substantial value that is being generated by our prudent investments in the future of our company. ","All of this progress would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of each and every one of our associates. While we have continued the integration and refinement of our Family Dollar banner, our supply chain teams have worked hard to overcome a year of unusual external costs and service issues, our merchants have continued to find incredible values, and our 15,000 plus store teams have focused on our customers, delivering a great Q4 sales result. Our success would not be possible without them, and we thank them for their commitment and support to our common vision to be the winner in value retail. ","Operator, we're now ready to take questions","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So Gary, obviously '19 we just started here. But when you think about your '20 sort of outlook that does not include buyback, correct? And it is based off of the 4.85 to 5.25 guidance as we sit today. Is that correct?","Gary Philbin","That's right John. With the emphasis being around, we talked about this being a first half, second half of '19, and really because of the investment of what we have to do on the re-banners, close the stores in the first half, get the H2 renovations going, we want to give a little color on our confidence in the plan. The trajectory you will see in the back half and to complete the painting of that picture, we want to give some sense of what we expect on guidance as we look as far on to '20. And exactly, to your point, it includes that coming off of our guidance that we gave this morning the 4.85 to 5.25.","John Heinbockel","And then as a follow-up to that, do you look at '20 and maybe even beyond, significant recovery at Family Dollar, or are we sort of implying high-single digit, maybe little better EBIT growth at Dollar Tree?","Gary Philbin","Well, Dollar Tree of course is performing at a high level, so we continue to see the Dollar Tree leverage being, it's always about our top line, our margins even in this year. If you take the backdrop of both tariffs and freight, we've been able to manage through this year. I think at a level that I'm proud of our team. It delivers to the bottom line, as we drive more footsteps into our stores. So, Dollar Tree is always about driving more footsteps and to drive the top line comp, and that delivers the four-wall EBIT that drives down to the enterprise. ","For Family Dollar, the recovery is exactly what we\u2019ve described, the first half and the second half trajectory, with the second half picking up steam, and as I would call out, that we will continue to plan on doing additional H2 renovations into '20 and beyond to get to the inflection point that we see, which is changing this fleet of stores one store at a time. So it's a combination of Dollar Tree firing on all cylinders like we have been, and we are going to change the trajectory of Family Dollar stores with the renovation program, and the other initiatives that we called out too, that speak to some of the assortment in adult beverage and other categories","Operator","Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short","Just wanted to ask a little bit about Family Dollar H2; obviously you are very committed to fixing the business. So what obviously matters to everyone on this call is what the EBITDA margin profile could look like going forward. So can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the H2 EBITDA margin profile as a start? ","Kevin Wampler","Karen, this is Kevin. As we look at it, obviously the points we've given you today are really about the top line growth. And as you heard Gary talk about the fact that we are seeing lifts in these stores of over, on average 10%, and then obviously then it really relates back to what does that drive. And it's going to drive a better operating income; it's going to drive a better EBITDA margin at the end of the day. We haven't really given any metrics around that, everything we've built in again is built into our guidance. ","And again, you've got to remember, at this point in time, it's about investments especially in the first half, as we talked about the fact that the costs are front-end loaded with 75% being occurred within the first two quarters; and in particular, Q2 will be affected more than in Q1, just based upon the number of projects and the pace of things especially around if we look at other things beyond that. If we look at store support center consolidation as well as store closures, a lot of those things will be happening and be affected in the second quarter. ","As we go forward though, obviously there is an expectation from an EBITDA margin to grow in the Family Dollar business, and again get back to something of a more historical nature. And I don't think we've changed in that manner, and our thought process really from day one, it\u2019s just the new model, the new renovations, and driving that forward along with the other initiatives we've got going on.","Karen Short","And then just on the tariffs, so obviously your guidance assumes or reflects 25% implemented in March. So, anyway you could help, give some color on what the actual impact is to earnings from that, and then the second part of that is the 10% may be removed as well, so any way to think about how your numbers or guidance might change if 25% doesn't happen and 10% also gets removed?","Gary Philbin","Well Karen, it's a good point. We are trying to follow the same progress everyone else does, but we've built a plan assuming 25% was going to be in for the full year, and that's in our guidance. If 25% comes down, obviously it says we're going to have some savings in the back half where we bought our product and as we went over in January of this year. I guess the way I think about it, is there upside? Yes. As always, we're going to manage in real time, because truly it's all about footsteps at both banners, what do we need to invest in the right product at Dollar Tree, what's the right retails potentially at Family Dollar.","We went into this knowing that this year was a potential of $100 million at Dollar Tree, as a potential tariff impact and 40 million at Family Dollar. We've mitigated most of that, and I'd say most because when the 25% was announced lots of items were already on the water, so some of that impact is in the first half versus what we are able to negotiate in the back half. That well, I look forward to the bottom line, where it gives us an opportunity to invest in the business as we see tariffs change from 25 to 10 or 10 to 0.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","So, Kevin you just talked about no real change in how you're thinking about Family Dollar's future profitability, but you guys also just took a $2.7 billion goodwill write-down. So I'm just trying to reconcile those two, and has there been any changes regarding the future profitability potential at Family Dollar?","Kevin Wampler","Well understand this Scot that the goodwill impairment is a function of an accounting process at the end of the day, and it\u2019s at a point in time. And so as we've looked at our strategic and operational plans going forward and really built this plan around all the initiatives that we've spoken about this morning, those things will have the effect of improving the business. But at this point in time, as you look at it and you kind of create the new baseline, which was really this year, 2018's financial results; you do a calculation based at that point in time or as needed. So I don't think that from my perspective that doesn't change our view of the future, and the value that can be created with the Family Dollar segment. So that hasn't changed, and that's really my comment is what I said from our view of the long-term position.","Scot Ciccarelli","And hopefully just a housekeeping item is there any assumption built into your earnings guidance for the multi price point test at Dollar Tree?","Gary Philbin","Hey Scot, it\u2019s Gary. Now listen, we wanted to give you a sense of how we think about our testing, and as a management team you've heard us in the past talk about some of them, others never make the light of day. But listen this is something that we are going to be very smart about. We have some insights from our past tests that we've done, but there is nothing in guidance. And listen, we'll report on it as we see it's something that we need to report on.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Chuck Grom","I was wondering, if you guys can just discuss the improvement at the Family Dollar segment here in the fourth quarter and your confidence in the sustainability of that. And the reason I ask this is, over the past couple of years you've had some good quarters at Family Dollar, some softer quarters, just curious your confidence in the improvement. And then as a follow-up to that Gary, just on the decision to test the multi-price points, how extensive is that going to be? Is it number of SKUs you are going to be testing it, is it going to be measured by the number of stores, and then just ultimately just why now why the decision to do it? ","Gary Philbin","We had a good Q4 of both banners Dollar Tree and Family Dollar with the comp. The confidence in the business, listen we renovated 585 stores as we've said before, only 200 and change of those were H2s. What the H2 has changed is really the footsteps into those stores, and that's what gives us confidence in the model across the demographics, locations, competitive sets, the ability. Our technology has allowed us to do now to be able to put Dollar Tree product easily into the Family Dollar stores. That's what gives me confidence, but the comp for the fourth quarter was really all but rising in to the things that we are doing every day at Family Dollar to drive the business. So it was a good Q4, and what I was pleased with was the important December timeframe, where we invested in categories, toys, like a lot of folks did. ","We had a strong toy category season, the consumables which we've always talked about being the bellwether what we try to track and what our customers need most are doing well. So what's ahead of us are more H2s, and it changes the foot traffic because it's more of what our customers need across the categories. And while the previous renovated stores are doing okay, what the H2 stores delivered are higher footsteps, a modest increase in basket, but it's really about our customers coming in and gaining, shopping more of the isles, and seeing more of the categories, and more of the dollar price points along with some of what we're doing with WOW tables and queuing lines. ","So it's a nice combination to drive in the customer with what she needs and what she wants, and reflects a lot of the impact that we can do over the years that we've seen with Dollar Tree on seasons, and now you have the ability to spread out that price point. For the multi-price point, here's how I'd like you all to think about it. Listen, we have an ability now to easily get into some product that our Family Dollar merchant team buys. We're over together in the same factories, when we travel to Asia, we work in the same office. That's really where the rubber hits the road in terms of identifying these WOW items. ","So when I think about how we are going to test a multi-price item, what that means at Dollar Tree when we've done it before, well here's an opportunity to select items especially around high value items that we see when we're together on important trips, something different that would complement Dollar Tree. And what's the success in this? Well listen let's protect the brand, and Dollar Tree to me is so unique, it cuts through, it clarifies for our customers. I've received plenty of letters and emails from customers that tell us exactly that. ","It doesn't mean we shouldn't test though, and we're going to go into this with the thought that listen why now? Because why won't we do it now? We've always been (inaudible) that test and learn, and we're open to ideas and good ideas that work, and success for this is adding to the brand and developing something that our customers still say I go to Dollar Tree because of that WOW factor. And listen the customers won't tell us exactly what it is they see, feel. We'll be all over this thing as we test and learn as we go forward","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","I wanted to first ask, maybe for a little bit more color on the guidance, maybe particularly as we look at the first quarter. Could you help us better understand what you are assuming from a Snap, you know headwind given the pull forward in timing, along with assumptions around the initiative related costs, should we see a continued markdowns, deleverage on occupancy, just maybe hold our hands a bit more there Kevin? ","Kevin Wampler","Good morning Paul, as we work through the plan for our guidance together again the biggest differential year-over-year is obviously the initiatives and the pace of initiatives and the costs, not just the number of projects, but as we've said we now have the store closures as well as the store support (inaudible) consolidation of those costs as well. As we said the costs that we called out really 75% being incurred in the first half roughly as we look at it today, and again I would tell you, of that it's really a one-third, two-third type of situation between the first quarter and second quarter, because as I said, second quarter gets impacted much more just based upon the timing of various aspects of that. ","And so what do you see, basically you do see the effect of some additional markdowns as we go through the renovations right? We basically have to move some inventory, there are some things that we discontinue to make room for the $1 product. So to your point, markdowns will continue to be a big piece of that. The other thing you see from a cost perspective is labor, the other piece of this is, we have to have teams that go across the company and do these resets, and so they have that as well as our travel and things like that. So those are couple of the big buckets of costs. So I think that's important. ","And then obviously this past year we had the reinvestment in labor again, so we'll call that a one-time investment, but again as we know states continue to increase their minimum wage, so we'll see some pressure from that as well. As far as Snap, we did see benefits in January from the movement of February in Snap to about January 20. I think our calculation would tell you it's about a roughly 30 basis point benefit to the quarter for Family Dollar, and I think that's pretty much in line with what you've heard probably from some other retailers as well. ","But again I think what our viewpoint is, as we go forward and we get a late Easter, which we think that it's a little more beneficial typically to Dollar Tree than Family Dollar, but it is typically a good timeframe when we get that late Easter and get that warmer weather and get people into the stores and kind of broaden the product that's there for them to look at. So those are just some of the background, some of the color, we've got going on in Q1, Q2 as we go forward.","Paul Trussell","And my quick follow-up is just around store plans, you have an aggressive plan in place around at least 1000 remodels this year. But you mentioned in the press release that that might accelerate further over the following years. So maybe just touch based on how we should think about what percent of the total fleet could ultimately get this remodel, and how does that impact your thought process around opening up new doors and still being a square footage growth story? ","Gary Philbin","Hey Paul, Gary. I think you're exactly right, we called down a 1000, and the cadence this year and why the impact is in the first half, I want to get these things done no later than somewhere in Q3. And if we can end up doing more of them, we'll try to do that. But the 1000 is based on us getting it done primarily in the first half. It will go into Q3, but we need to get more stores behind us. And I would - we are not ready to call on (inaudible) next year, but certainly I can see 1000 next year as well. We are touching a lot of stores, not just Family Dollar, but Dollar Tree stores too which we haven't talked much about. But with our snack zone delivering a nice comp in the stores that we're putting that in, we're touching 1000 Dollar Tree stores too to drive top line business, and bottom line performance. ","So we have a lot of human capital extended this year, and my sense is as we go into the out years, we'll start to ramp up store count at Family Dollar, because we are going to like the phase 2 and not just because of performance, it will also help what we do on our comps as we get more new stores behind us. So I would see not ready to declare '20, but I would say it's going to be a similar renovation count, and I'm going to see some additional new stores as we look out into '20 to say that's the growth factor in places our Family Dollar stores perhaps have been most challenged. And let's put an H2 store in some of the greenfield areas that we can grow the business. So this is a business that we're focused on, we're going fix it, and we're going to grow it, and that's what this initiative is all about","Operator","Our last question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.","Kelly Bania","First just wanted to ask on the cost of the H2 remodels, I believe the prior remodels are of around 100,000 to 150,000. I'm wondering if that's gone up with the incremental lift there and then just had another follow-up as well?","Gary Philbin","The cost again I think we spoke to this last quarter is really - kind of ranges between $100,000 to $150,000, and again the variables affecting that are the number of freezers and coolers we may be adding, as well as in some cases, if it's an older stores there may be some deferred maintenance that we're also addressing as well as we go through the process. So that's still our general range on a cost basis.","Kelly Bania","And then just another one on the multi-price point test, maybe just can you remind us, what you have found in the past as you have test these, what you did and didn't like and what you're specifically looking for this time, and how long you expect to do this test?","Gary Philbin","Well Kelly you're probably asking more than I can answer. But I would say, what we in both OOPS and Dollar Tree, remember Deals was a single price point banner, and then we converted it to some multi-price, and in fact we took some Dollar attributes along the way and added that to a Dollar Tree deals format. So what's the takeaway? our customers are very loyal to what Dollar Tree represents. We all know that it's a brand, it's not just pricing item it's a brand that they can count on as they walk through the door. And so between what we marketed and how we showed it in store the categories that we put it in, how our customers shop different categories and adjacencies, those are all the things that we captured with the other tests that gave us insight. ","And as we go into this, we take some of those learnings to say let's be as smart as we can in what we're trying to achieve in terms of success. And I can't put a timeline on it for you. This is test and (inaudible) you do something, you tweak it and you change it. So that's just been really the discipline we bring to it to make sure we understand what is it we're doing what our customer see, and quite frankly the customer research at the end of day tells us what our customers sees on this. So more to come, we'll go into this with the eyes wide open, based on what we've done in the past, and do it in a very disciplined and logical way.","Operator","Thank you everyone.

This morning we announced results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Total sales increased to $4.95 billion and same-store sales increased 2.1% on a constant currency basis.","Adjusted cash EPS increased 30.4% to $1.33 per share versus $1.02 per share in the prior year's third quarter. Despite what continues to be viewed by many as a challenging retail environment, I\u2019m very pleased with our third quarter performance and especially with our contingent progress in integrating our recent acquisition of Family Dollar.","There have been no surprises that will change our outlook on the strategic rationale. There is only increased excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead as a larger, stronger and more diversified organization. We\u2019re only one full quarter into the integration and both our teams are aligned strategically and collaborating to deliver solid results.","Accomplishment in the third quarter include another solid quarter for the Dollar Tree banner. As expected Dollar Tree delivered a low single digit positive sales comp. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.1% and that was on top of a strong 5.9% increase in the third quarter last year. This was the most difficult quarterly comparison for the year.","On a two-year stacked basis, our same-store sales accelerated from the second quarter to the third quarter just as they had done from the first quarter to the second.","Sales growth in Q3 was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. We\u2019re making meaningful progress on integrating the Family Dollar banner. Only one full quarter end, the stores are cleaner, the shelves were better stocked, we've cleaned up old inventory and the end caps are more compelling and relevant.","The feedback we\u2019re receiving from store teams and customers has been positive. We\u2019ve developed and announced plans to re-banner our deals locations. Our full resources and energy are being focused on our two primary banners Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, and on November 2 we announced the successful completion of our required divesture of 330 Family Dollar stores.","I\u2019m extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was the 31st consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Third quarter results continue to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand as customers are shopping with us more often, we're attracting new customers every day and when the customers are in the store, they're buying more.","Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base.","Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day.","Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandize values are better than ever.","Seasonal energy was high beginning in August with back-to-school, in addition to dominant displays of back-to-school basics the customers responded favorably to brightly colored fashioned stationary, teacher supplies, classroom essentials and lunch box values all priced at $1.","In September, we celebrated Dollar Tree\u2019s 29th anniversary with bonus buys and well items for our customers, key categories included cleaning supplies, home office essentials, snacks and a broad assortment of special values from our million dollar brands. Our stores were filled with well-known national brands and high value private labels throughout the event.","Seasonally our store teams transitioned efficiently from back to school to fall harvest and Halloween. In September, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquarters with major statements in Halloween costumes, make up home d\u00e9cor, candy and party supplies.","Customers responded enthusiastically and our sell through was improved over last year. Dollar Tree stores are now set and prepared for Christmas and fourth quarter Holiday shopping season.","For the third quarter, same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both our basic consumables and discretionary products. The top performing categories in the quarter included snacks and beverage, candy and food, household supplies and beauty and eyewear.","Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Mid-West followed by the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast. All six geographic zones produced positive same-store sales for the quarter.","Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to customer\u2019s sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores.","In the third quarter, we opened a total of 118 new Dollar Tree stores and relocated or expanded 16 stores for a total of 134 projects. Additionally, during the quarter, we re-bannered 143 Family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree stores and we\u2019re pleased with the results.","We're now targeting a total of 200 conversions in this fiscal year. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 9.9% compared to the prior year and we ended the quarter with 5,841 Dollar Tree stores in North America.","In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive the business initiatives include category expansions, customers realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in our pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products.","Seasonal relevance, our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Merchandize energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout of the store at Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value. And being first of the month ready, we place special emphasis on basic consumables, core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs.","Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the third quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 135 additional stores for a total of 390 stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,148 stores and growing.","We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. Construction on our newest DC in Cherokee County, South Carolina is well underway. This 1.5 million square foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We plan to have the facility operational in Q3 of 2016.","Additionally to support continued growth in our California markets we are expanding our Stockton distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet, and increase of 55%. This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of our second quarter in 2016.","Again I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the third quarter. Our Dollar Tree segment continues to deliver sector leading operating margins. Our customer base is large and growing, and we are on schedule with our integration of Family Dollar.","We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us, as a combined organization. I view the strategic rationale as more compelling than ever. In the early days of integration, we found nothing that diminishes our vision and plans for value creation.","In fact I'm even more enthusiastic about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. Our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar are on the customer, the shopping experience and the value equation.","In the third quarter we kicked off our red red-tag clearance event, while continuing the review of our merchandise assortments and category flow, refining real estate plans, reviewing and refining marketing plans, and defining the table stakes in our stores.","With our red-tag clearance event we identified markdown and cleared out old slow-moving and non-productive inventory. In doing so, we reclaimed our end caps to make way for fresh new and seasonal merchandise and to refresh our discretionary sections and apparel home and seasonal.","All of these are important categories as we enter the holidays. The red-tag event was well executed across stores, customers responded to the additional savings and we have cleared more than $135 million at retail in aged and non-productive inventory.","Merchandise assortments are under review. Our focus is on providing product and value that best meets our customer\u2019s needs. We are paying special attention to opening price point, national brand pricing, private label products, enrolls, while rationalizing SKUs for increase productivity and a focus on basic in stock levels.","In real estate we are analyzing portfolio data to gain a better understanding of customer and demographic targets. This is assisting in the identification of additional stores that we have better Dollar Tree demographics for potential re-banner and identifying metrics for improving new store productivity and our return on investment.","We are extremely focused on opportunities to improve the customer experience. The table stakes requirements are being refined, quantified and rolled out for testing. Table stakes includes store standards and conditions, the customer experience, merchandise relevance, and customer engagement to name a few of the key metrics.","Many of these metrics are less about investment and more about disciplines and benchmarks. Customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter. For table stakes initiatives that require investments we plan to manage with the same disciplined approach that we've used at family Dollar Tree for many years.","Identifying and paying special attention to the customer facing metrics with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement. We're making great progress on delivering announced synergies. We have confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third full year post closing.","In fact, I'll be disappointed if we don't exceed this number. As a reminder, the synergies will be driven through four primary avenues. Sourcing and procurement, our re-bannered program for optimizing store formats, distribution and logistics, and overhead and corporate SG&A. As announced, we expect to spend approximately $300 million in one-time cost to achieve these synergies.","We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but at this stage we're clearly on track to achieve our year one milestone of at least $75 million in run rate synergies.","Plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies are well underway. Our exact match initiative to provide the lowest cost on identical items across both banners is nearly complete with expected results no surprises.","The review of similar match items continues positive results are growing. We are achieving payment term parody with savings from harmonizing payment terms, auctions, RFPs and formal bid process are well underway on expense items. Our savings continue to build towards expectations.","During the third quarter we re-bannered an additional 143 family Dollar Stores to Dollar Tree bringing our total of converted stores to 147. We are continuing to re-banner stores into November and fourth quarter and we are now targeting a total of 200 conversions for fiscal 2015.","The preliminary results are meeting expectations and feedback from both store teams and customers has been positive. We are well on our way towards finalizing the supply chain roadmap and initiating the multiple banner supple chain project.","With the cross organizational functional team we're integrating our warehouse management systems. And we\u2019re making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing our space need by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners at all facilities. This is a very large project with a very significant opportunity for long-term synergies.","Our pilot facilities planned to be operational in third quarter of 2016. We continue to make progress on reducing cost through our shared services model. We are combining back office functions to support both banners through our shared services organization.","Over time, the shared services will include human resources, finance, information technology, supply chain and logistics, legal, strategy and internal audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization through a more cost effective approach.","On October 13, 2015 we announced plans to re-banner all 222 deals locations in 2016. For nearly a decade our committed team of Deals associates has done a great job of consistently providing customers with terrific values. With the acquisition of Family Dollar we are confidence that we can provide more focus and better serve our deals customers and markets through our primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.","We will begin to conversion of deals in January with plans to complete the re-bannering of all Deal stores by the end of July 2016. Only a few months into the integration we have made great progress. There are some quick and easy wins and some that we will take a more time and great deal of work. The timing of some will be depended on our IT integration.","Our strategy is not to touch everything at once but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall banners for business for the long-term. It is a process it will take more than a few months but the return is worth it.","Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for the remainder of 2015.","Kevin Wampler","Thanks, Bob and good morning. As a result of the recent acquisition year-over-year comparisons for the next several quarters will be very complex. However, we had added tables to the press release which will we believe will helpful in understanding the ongoing business.","Total sales for the third quarter grew 136% to $4.95 billion which includes our first full quarter of Family Dollar sales. Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.4% to $2.27 billion, all Family Dollar segment sales increased 6.1% to $2.67 billion. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.1% versus a very strong 5.9% in the prior year's third quarter.","The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket increases. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations the same-store sales grew 1.7%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly re-bannered are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation.","We were pleased with Family Dollar sales during the quarter we saw low-to-mid single digit positive same-store sales each month during the quarter. September was the strongest month driven by the timing of our red-tag clearance event. Geographically, sales strength was relatively balanced by region.","Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $674.7 million, or 93%, to $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. The majority of the dollar increased was driven by Family Dollar gross profit of $627.8 million.","A few factors to note are: during the quarter $38.4 million was amortized to cost of goods sold related to the inventory setup and negatively impacted gross margin results.","This amount was higher than originally projected based on inventory sell-through. The total dollar amount to be amortized has not changed. We currently estimate an additional $11 million wil be amortized to cost of goods sold in Q4.","During the third quarter we took an additional $30 million in markdowns related -- markdown related expense in the Family Dollar banner for red-tag clearance event. We opt take advantage of the success and traffic of the clearance event to clear additional inventory that was deemed to non-go forward.","Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34% during the third quarter compared with 34.6% in the prior year's third quarter. The 60 basis point decline as a percent of sales was primarily driven by a decrease in mark-on related to the increased third-party product testing, increased freight, and higher distribution center labor costs.","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 23.5% during the third quarter compared with 24.3% in the comparable period - comparable prior year period. Excluding the $38.4 million of inventory step up amortization in the $30 million of additional clearance mark-on gross profit margin was 24 point - 25.4% for the quarter.","The improvement of 110 basis points on a comparable basis was driven by improved the mark-on, lower markdowns, improvement in freight and distribution costs, partially offset by higher occupancy costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 132.7% to $1.18 billion from $505.6 million in last year's third quarter. The majority of the $670.7 million increase related to $628.9 of Family Dollar expense.","Q3 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 24.1% consistent with the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $20.3 million of acquisition and integration related cost, while the prior year included $14.3 million of acquisition related costs.","Excluded the - excluding these cost, adjusted SG&A improved to 23.3% for Q3 compared to 23.5% for the prior year's quarter. This 20 basis point improvement was driven primarily by lower incentive comp and legal fees.","SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 23.5% compared to 23% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. The current year includes $6.8 million of integration and divestiture costs. $19.8 million of depreciation for amortization of policies and fair market value adjustments, and $19.2 million of favorable lease right amortization.","The prior year's comparable period included $30.6 million of restructuring charges and $9.7 million of acquisition related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A increased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.8% from 21.4% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased repair and maintenance expense for the quarter.","Adjusted operating income, excluding acquisition and integrated related costs for Dollar Tree segment increased $11.1 million to $245.1 million. As a percent of sales, adjusted operating income decreased 40 basis points to 10.8% compared to 11.2% of sales in the prior year's third quarter.","Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $23.1 million to $96.1 million. As a percent to sales, adjusted operating income increased 70 basis points to 3.6% compared to 2.9% of sales in the prior year's comparable period.","Non-operating expenses for the third quarter totaled $99 million and were comprised primarily of net interest expense of $98.4 million in the quarter. For the third quarter, the company had net income of $81.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per share is detailed in the press release tables was $0.49 per diluted share.","On an adjusted cash EPS basis, earnings perspective share for the quarter increased 30.4% to $1.33 per share compared to $1.02 per share in last year's third quarter. In our earnings release issued this morning, we provided a detailed reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash earnings and adjusted cash earnings perspective share.","Our tax \u2013 our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34.3% compared to 36.5% in the prior year's quarter. The lower rate was primarily attributable to an increase in Work Opportunity Tax Credits or WOTC in relation to income for the third quarter and a decrease in state tax expense.","Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.1 billion compared to $407.6 million at the end of the third quarter of last year. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 12.1% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 9.9%.","Inventory per selling square foot increased 2%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings in our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter.","For the Family Dollar segment, we are extremely pleased with our clearance event which eliminated aged and non-productive inventory and at the end of the quarter inventory decreased 0.2% compared with the prior year, where are continuing review merchandise assortments into our current inventory levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter.","Capital expenditures were $169.5 million in the third quarter of 2015 versus 94.2 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2015 we are planning for capital - consolidated expenditures to range from $505 million to $525 million.","Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including additional key development stores, re-banner select Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability approximate 425 stores, IT system enhancements, a construction of our new Cherokee County South Carolina distribution center and the expansion of our stock in California distribution center.","Depreciation and amortization totaled 168.7 million for the third quarter versus $50.9 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2015 we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million.","As discussed with Q2, this range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for two items, first it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar's as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies and the increase in the value of assets based on purchase price allocation.","Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase rights valuation of Family Dollar leases.","Our guidance takes into account our actual performance for the first three quarters of 2015, as well as our visibility and forecast for the remainder of the year. Our guidance includes the following assumptions.","I'd like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that were re-bannered from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations where they have been owned by Dollar Tree or opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months.","We will continue to experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our re-banner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our re-banner strategy and analysis, and our outlook for same-store sales.","In October 13 we announced our 2016 plans to re-banner all of our deal store locations. So that we can place all of our focus on our two primary banners, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.","The conversion process will be similar to that we are using to convert Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree's. We expect to have this initiative completed by the end of July 2016.","Our guidance includes $12.5 million of markdown reserves, accelerated depreciation and other re-bannering expense. This represents our best estimate at this time to complete the re-bannering of deal stores to Dollar Tree stores.","In November 2 just after our third quarter ended, we announced the successful completion of our require divestiture of 330 Family Dollar stores. These 330 stores represented approximate $45.5 million in annual operating income.","In terms of the sales have not been disclosed in the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree's assets and liabilities has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. The divestiture will have two effects on our future income.","In addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs and setup costs related to transition services.","Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months, we will be providing certain support and transitional services and expect to be reimbursed by the buyer for these direct operating costs and support services.","The expected financial effect of the divestitures, which includes the loss of the operating income from the 330 stores, along with the cost of the transition services agreement is included in our guidance.","Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 37.9% for the fourth quarter. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.8 million shares for Q4 and 223.5 million shares for the full year.","For the fourth quarter we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.32 billion to $5.42 billion. For fiscal 2015, we are now estimating total sales to range from $15.45 billion to $15.55 billion. Both of these estimates are based on a low single digit same-store sales increase.","We have attached our press release a reconciliation of the forecasted Q4 range of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash earnings per share. We are forecasting net income to range from $213.2 million to $242.2 million and adjusted cash earnings per diluted share of $2.32 to $2.51 for the fourth quarter.","I'll now turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Kevin. The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations 180,000 people and 23 distribution centers, which based on store count is the largest of any previous retail merger.","While we are very early in integration process, I'm pleased with our progress. We have great confidence in our ability and opportunity and the ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year three.","These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improve communication analysis, collaboration and incentives.","We are confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand to improvements in sales, margin, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.","I'll close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible, and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers, while recording record levels of earnings.","Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 31 consecutive quarters Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles consumers are looking for value, no matter the state of the economy. While on price point remains a dollar, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector.","With the addition of Family Dollar, we are larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers, and more markets with exactly what they are looking for, great value, in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us.","Operator, we are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. And congrats on the progress to date. So the first question I just wanted to ask is more around Family Dollar. I guess first is the inventory clearance now complete. Secondly, have the positive comps continued into the fourth quarter?","And then Bob if you could just talk about the categories that you been able to touch so far and how you'd like us to judge you during the holiday and into early next year?","Bob Sasser","Well Matt, thank you for the questions. I will tell you that we had great success with our clearance and the initial plans on that have been pretty much completed. We had great clean up on that as I said in the prepared remarks $135 million worth of inventory retail moved out.","We still will have Christmas to come. Obviously we're going to be better served in getting rid of that during the Christmas season. So that\u2019s smaller dollars, but that still yet to come in the fourth quarter.","The second question was fourth quarter trends. You know I will tell you that I'm really jazzed about fourth quarter. We are not going to report fourth quarter for a while. So I can\u2019t start talking to you about the sales and specificity, but all in all, we are excited about our plans.","At Family Dollar again we've opened up all of those end caps and all that space for our seasonal merchandise. The seasonal merchandise looks really terrific and we're excited about our opportunities there. And third question was categories?","Gary Philbin","So Matt, this is Gary. Let me just maybe add a little color. As we stepped into driving the business, step one was to get the red-tag clearance event going. That did a couple of things for us. It got rid of unproductive inventory. But I would say it also got ourselves set up for the holiday the right way, which is very important for us.","The category reviews are ongoing, but the priority going into the fourth quarter was just to make sure that our holiday merchandise and lot of our discretionary categories were in place.","So during the fourth quarter you are not going to see wholesale changes in categories. We are focused purely on getting the holiday merchandise out in front of the customer and I think we have our best opportunity this year to have a great sell on lots of seasonal relevant items.","The merchandising reviews will be ongoing as we go into fiscal '16 and you'll see those changes as we roll them out. But our focus now to the holidays is just purely sell all of the holiday merchandise related Thanksgiving and Christmas that we can.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just one quick follow-up. As we think for next year there's been a lot of talk out there about vendor negotiations and wages. Bob, I know you are not giving formal guidance until February. But anything larger picture that you\u2019ve uncovered that surprised you so far as you dug into Family Dollar and just any help around the best way to think about vendor funding and wages, I think would be really helpful?","Bob Sasser","Well you know, I will share with you this. One of our synergies was to work with our vendor partners to align the cost on the exact match items and also to begin work on the similar match items and we\u2019re really well into that and I'm really excited about - we are achieving what we expected in that.","As far as working with our vendors going forward, our plan is to work with them to provide the best product to our customers to sell it. We want to drive product sales from our vendor partners.","The way we go to market, we prefer in many cases to take those incentives and apply it to the cost of the goods in such a way that we can share that value with the customer. We're going to make money by selling product, not by collecting funds.","Now having said that, we don't expect the funds to go away, we expect to work with our vendor partners to use them in such a way that we can drive more cartons, more cases of their product through our doors.","So I'm excited about the transition. I think you can get as a retailer and many retailers, I think get too focus on collecting the funds and not focused enough on the customer, not focused enough on driving value for the customer.","And we are just exactly as we've done it at Dollar Tree, we're always focused on the customer, giving the best price that we possibly can, that includes getting our share of the funding where possible, but getting the lowest price possible, so that we can price a product appropriately and drive more case sales through the front doors.","And our vendor partners have the same goal by the way. So we are completely aligned on that strategy. I think that plans are coming together very nicely.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","We'll next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Sasser","Hey, Steve.","Stephen Grambling","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess changing the focus to the Dollar Tree business, as you look at the gross margin line, I think that Kevin mentioned the increased third-party product testing and increased freight cost. Can you elaborate on some of the drivers of both and how we should be thinking about these impacts going forward? And then I guess maybe a bigger picture question, just to your longer-term expectations for the Dollar Tree segment margin? Thanks.","Bob Sasser","Yes, Steve, that's a fair question. I can tell you that the two things that Kevin mentioned, the things that we do in the normal course of business, we have doubled down on our testing, testing more times, especially on some of the categories that are more subject to compliance issues, and the idea is we don't want to fail. We want to make sure that we are providing a safe product for our customers and we double down on our testing.","I think that's a one time, not that we're going to \u2013 not going continue testing, but what you saw there was a little bit of a bubble based on a change in the way we are doing our testing. That will smooth out over time. I have great confidence we'll be able to manage that for the long haul.","The second thing was, the big, largest impact was our DC productivity was lower in the third quarter and there is a couple of things there and they are all - you can point to them. We can identify them and we can fix them over time.","But we are here at peak inventory times at Dollar Tree. We are receiving all the products for - in the third quarter for our third quarter as well as our fourth quarter sales. It's a peak inventory time. And at the same time we decided to re-banner couple hundred Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree and we scrambled around to buy the products and insert that into the inventory equation receiving it in the appropriate DCs and maybe signing things a little differently moving things around.","As well as re-bannering our Deals stores, which over time we are not going to start that that until January, but just the planning and getting things positioned for that, reduced our overall productivity at a time when our buildings are an absolutely max peak capacity.","As I mentioned a couple of times we are building a new distribution center of 1,500,000 square feet. We always build ahead of the need, but just ahead of the need, in South Carolina to serve mid-Atlantic in Southeastern Dollar Tree stores, as well as expanding our Stockton distribution center over 50% for next year.","So we're opening up more capacity, while we are doing a lot of things in addition to what we had originally planned in our distribution model. The result was we had some distribution productivity lag, at the same time our outbound transportation which is something we\u2019ve talked about before was also a little higher than it has been in the past.","So all in all things are identifiable, opportunity to improve and we will improve on those, but that was really the main components of the drag on the gross profit number, at the third quarter.","Stephen Grambling","Great. And just a follow-up there, was just on the margin path going forward for Dollar Tree segment, which it sounds like from putting that altogether would be theoretically you'll see some of that even out and be up. Is that fair?","Bob Sasser","Yes. I mean, we are - as I said we are putting this huge company together into a shared services model. Over time we're going to be combining both banners under one supply chain, with all of our buildings supplying product for all banners with the ability to supply merchandise for all banners.","The same time we are looking at rationalizing our buildings and also identifying where the capacity needs are going to be for the future. All of that is going on right now.","What that means to us over time, we will have lower supply chain costs. We're looking for more productivity around our buildings. We're looking for reducing stem miles as we are able to service both Family Dollar stores and Dollar Tree stores out of the same building.","So there's a lot of opportunity to lower costs going forward, and to improve our service to our stores through the combined power of this combined supply chain.","Stephen Grambling","Great. Well, thanks for the answers. And good luck for the holidays.","Bob Sasser","Let me add one more thing, I don't think I gave you an answer on the margin for Dollar Tree going forward. Merchandise margin for Dollar Tree going forward, I don't think - we are always in control of that. It's more about the mix than it is the items, because we don't have to have anything.","I'll say again, we change a lot of our product every year and our buyers go to market with the same goal that is to offer the best value for a dollar at a margin that fits our margin requirements.","So we are still in control of our operating \u2013 our merchandise margin at Dollar Tree. We have this one quarter where we've got some little noise in there frankly. But like I said, that's identifiable, that\u2019s fixable. We're going to improve that over time.","But the merchandise markup at Dollar Tree is still absolutely in our control and I don't see any pressures to change that. Frankly, our sourcing opportunities are improved with both the size of our pencil [ph] now, as well as the economic conditions around the world, especially China. It's really a buyer's market out there. Thank you.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks for the color.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll next to Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder","Hi, good morning. It's Dan Binder. I was just curious if you could give us a little bit of color on your thinking for Family Dollar store growth next year and just remind us what it look like net for this year, net of the closings and re-brands?","Bob Sasser","You know, we're looking at that right now, Dan. As always, we announced our store growth at the January - the March call after our fourth quarter. And we're going to do that again.","There is plenty of room to grow. I will tell you that on the Dollar Tree side I've always said for years anyway, I've said 7,000 stores in the U.S. Dollar Tree stores and other thousand in Canada makes it 8000. The Family Dollar talking to them they\u2019ve said for some time 12,000 Family Dollar stores in the U.S.","So there's a potential to 20,000 stores there. We've got a little over 8000 now. So there are 13,000 now. So there is plenty of room to grow. We are putting together our plans for 2016. I will tell you that we are directionally pulling back on the number of stores, Family Dollar stores for next year.","We're not ready to announce that number yet, because we're still working on budgets and all the things, the CapEx and all that goes with that. And we would plan to continue to grow our Dollar Tree banner next year.","But again, I'm not going to give you the numbers until the March call. So that\u2019s directionally we're thinking about it. And we'll share more with you when we've got more firm numbers on that.","Dan Binder","And then my follow-up question was with regards to the fourth quarter guidance that you provided. If we think about sort of the breakdown between the Family Dollar operating margin versus the Dollar Tree operating margin, I'm not sure if you could just maybe comment to the Dollar Tree operating margin, how do you think about that for Q4.","Is it similar sort of contraction in Q4, as we saw in Q3 or do you think it\u2019s close to the flat or just directionally how think it plays out?","Bob Sasser","I think Dan, as we think about it, obviously because of the - what you got take into consideration is the deals information we gave today, which is a $12.5 million estimated cost. So that\u2019s - a big piece of that is markdowns, which is going to affect the gross margin.","Excluding that, I think we potentially see maybe a little pressure from freight in DC cost in the quarter or expect SG&A cost to continue to leverage obviously in the quarter just ended on basically a 2% comp we leverage 20 basis points, which felt like a pretty good performance with everything going on.","So I think in general, I think flattish operating margins for the Tree is a reasonable thought process. I think on the Family Dollar side, I think it\u2019s - as I think about it it's really around how does the holiday sell through grow and Gary talked about the holiday merchandise and the focus on that and that will determine I think how that plays out at the end of the \u2013 we're very excited about it and have high expectations and that will be a big piece.","I think from Family Dollar on the SG&A side in general my expectation would be to show improvement from where we were in Q3. In Q3 we were up 40 basis points year-over-year and I wouldn\u2019t expect to that sort of key up 40 basis points, but if we can get somewhere closer to flat, we'd be in a better position I think.","Dan Binder","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","We'll next to Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Thanks a lot for taking my questions. On the SG&A for the Family Dollar business, how much of the increase that you saw in the quarter that you are implying for the fourth quarter is a cost of doing business and how much is more one time in nature.","I think the markets trying to understand what the true underlying operating income production of Family Dollar might be and then we can layer on what our expectations and synergies and other factors might be over the long-term. Right now it's difficult to comprehend it at this point.","Bob Sasser","Yes, well I think, obviously given the color that looking for the SG&A to be flat to maybe slightly up, we're obviously operating in real time. There's a lot of moving levers, no surprise there at the end of the day. You know we're being prescriptive the way we look at things on an overall basis.","We've talked about the need to potentially invest in the stores. So you saw repairs and maintenance being up in Q3. Not totally surprising. So some of that was normal course, some of that was catch-up. We don't necessarily break it totally down that way when we're looking at it. So we're running the business in real time.","We look to control the cost where we can. We don't just spend money that we don't have to very prescriptive in the way we do it. I know that really doesn't answer the question, but I don't know that if I truly can answer your question, in the sense of how much of it is one time versus ongoing.","So I mean, that's really what we tried to do in the quarter in a sense of stripping out all the unusual things and getting back to a more baseline analysis of showing it up 40 basis points, with the - basically the main component being repairs and maintenance. So again it's a work in progress and we'll continue to go forward.","Michael Lasser","Let me ask you from a different perspective, as you look back last year on standalone basis, Family Dollar did about $0.5 billion in operating income. Is there anything that you're seeing in the business now to suggest that structurally the way you going to run the business is that operating income production will be lower as results of investments that you're going to need to be made or other changes moving forward.","And I want to by the spirit of the question, so now I also tie back can you talk about the interest expense outlook for the fourth quarter is that a sustainable run rate? Thank you.","Bob Sasser","Interest rate for the fourth quarter as in our guidance is projected at $98.4 million if you look at the table. I believe it\u2019s last table in the scheduled to the press release that details out the expected interest expense. So that number is what we would expect without any rate increases on an overall standpoint.","As far as operating income, we've said generally speaking, our belief is that we can overtime, Family Dollar backed the historical operating margins which I think we're, if you look at the last 10 year period they were basically 7% to 8% for a vast majority of that timeframe. There is no belief that we can do that, I think that\u2019s really the way we are focused on an as first to a specific number of $500 million or whatever.","It really more about, continue improvement so the way we think about the Dollar Tree business we're thinking about the Family Dollar business the same way to continue improvement, how do we, continue to make the merchandize more relevant, how do we run to stores better, how do we control our cost and how we bring it to the bottom line at the end of the day so there is no different there. But there is nothing structurally or competitive wise that would preclude us from, overtime getting back to that 7% to 8% range.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thanks for the color. And have a good holiday.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we do have time for just a couple more questions. We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hi, guys, first the clarification and then question. Kevin just to be clear that, the reconciliation for the quarter that you've disclosed the $0.49 that still includes the roughly $66 million of excess amortization you previously highlight in you\u2019re 8-K is that right, so it\u2019s more like a $0.67 EPS number?","Bob Sasser","Basically what we did Scott is what we have done here we taken our report income before income taxes and really adjusted for items that we had not previously given this Tree.","So the Tree have been given detailed information via our second quarter call as well as an 8-K that subsequently filed in regards to really the three biggest items being inventory step-up amortization as well as the depreciation for the amortization of the policies as well as the favorable lease right amortization.","We had given you all the information so we assume that was, that would in our number because we have given it to you. What we've done here is basically reconcile the things you didn\u2019t know. So the inventory step-up was actually $38.4 million as oppose to the $26.9 million we had given you.","So we have adjusted for that $11.5 million difference. We took an additional $13 million of markdowns for our Red Tech clearance sales and we've adjusted for that.","And then acquisition fees and integration and divestiture-related costs which this Tree couldn\u2019t predict or we did not give any numbers on that. That\u2019s the way we thought about it as really trying to reconcile our number based upon information that has not been previously given.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you. That\u2019s very, very helpful for the color. Thank you. Now I guess the question that you guys have been growing Dollar Tree square footage at 7% for many years, obviously you're very comfortable with that 7% growth cadence but now we're doing the re-banners we are depending Deal re-banners coupled with, what's call the Greenfield store growth.","Can you talk about your thoughts on the Dollar Tree store growth cannibalization and kind how that may play out?","Bob Sasser","We have looked at the cannibalization there is some degree of cannibalization this year from the 200 stores that we re-bannering. There will be some cannibalization next year from the additional re-banner stores as well as the re-bannering of the deal stores to Dollar Tree, and some of them to Family Dollar.","So there will be continued to be some cannibalization. They are always is when we had looked at these stores to re-banner as well as when we look at new stores that we look at the sales projections for the particular store.","We also look at the any cannibalization that\u2019s going to occur in the market. So we look at surrounding stores and we define what we think the cannibalizations are going to be, we then look at the market returns when we opening up the new stores. And we're going to continue to do that, we've done it with the rebanner stores from Family Dollar.","We're doing it with the Deal stores go into Dollar Tree and we'll with new stores. So cannibalization is just part of it but after you have opened up the first store, the second store, the cannibalization in the market. So, but I will tell you we've done a homework on it.","We're pleased with the results that we're getting also from the once we have already rebannered. The Deal stores that we're going to rebanner we build that on model of real estate model for Dollar Tree.","So that\u2019s one of the reasons that most of those are turning into Dollar Trees that is because they will serve our interest better with higher returns as Dollar Trees they are go into Family Dollar. So cannibalization is part of it, we'll talk about it, we'll point it out, but it's really the growth in the market and growth in the business for the company that\u2019s most important.","Scot Ciccarelli","Right, as we're going to go in the fourth quarter guidance, now and kind of the look for 2016 is that something you might be able to define for the Tree a little bit better?","Bob Sasser","That we've included in our guidance. And I think that\u2019s the best way we can share with you is that, as we give guidance we've included all the things that we know including cannibalization, including anything that would come in there.","Scot Ciccarelli","Great, thanks a lot guys.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our final question today from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about pricing, Family Dollar sales obviously were strong in the quarter. And I believe you mentioned about $135 million of excess inventory that you're able to get out of that which I think is about 500 basis points of add on sales.","How do we think about your pricing strategy going forward with in this box you mentioned looking at some private label insert, some open price points. But in particular on the national branded goods where I know that there was, at least historically a bit of spread there between them and peers?","Bob Sasser","Well, Paul I want to say couple of words on specific Gary because he is living in and breath in this every day but obviously intend to be comparably priced on international brand products where you tend to offer a selection of private label name brand equivalent products that is a value to the customers, lower retails than the national brand but it is equivalent to quality.","We think there is a big opportunity in our direct customers I think they will appreciate the value of being able to buy a name brand equivalent product that cost 30% less for example, or 20% less or less than the name brand.","So the combination of name brands compared to priced, name equivalent products at a nice discount to the name brand price as well as some special opportunity that all the things that we can do with our size to take advantage of opportunities exist through the year. Gary would you like to add anything on the this\u2026","Gary Philbin","Paul let me may be start with your first comment on the $135 million. Keep in mind that was the retail value before we start to markdowns. So we start with the cadence that was already discounted in stores some are between 10%, 15%, 20% off and then we started our markdown cadence, so 50, 75, 90.","So, when you think about the units that we cleared out the actually retail sales that we were receiving from that pilot goods was fairly statistic over that time. I think the good news on the clearance was when folks came in for that event they tend to buy something else from store at our regular retails.","And so I think the energy and just getting our stores cleaned up a bit, getting our end-caps reclaimed by organizing and clearance even which is no smaller task to make it look like something all served as pretty well. Maybe just to tag on to Bob's comments, there is an art and science to pricing. And the science piece is we do want to be grounded against our strategy on competition you will always have an eye on them.","But what we really focused on at Family Dollar is what was meant for to our customers. What is that they need for first two months, what's the best goods that they are looking to buy on a weekly and monthly basis.","And so our strategy is one that talks to what's on-promotion and what's on-shelf. The addition for Family Dollar of a private label firm needs to be polished up and really enhanced opening price point and some of the assortment gas we have is a great one. Not to mention the addition of we have a great import program, but that can also drive additional value into the store.","So we really see all those arrows in our paper as we get routed and what do we need to be competitive. But really stay focused on what a Family Dollar customer needs to drive value and deliver basket on a weekly and monthly basis. So that's the approach we're taking as we go through our category reviews and looking into '16.","Paul Trussell","That's very helpful color. Thank you. And just a follow up to close. Bob, maybe if you can just touch on the consumer overall. I think that you\u2019re better than expected revenue comes on the heels of some other discounters, perhaps beating some expectations.","Is your sense that your core customer is a bit more confident now, has a little bit more money in their pocket or are all of your gains more market share driven?","Bob Sasser","You know, Paul, I think the customer especially our customer, our middle income, low middle income to lower income customers are still under pressure and they are concerned. They've seen lower gasoline prices and that's helpful. But at the same time it's not enough to do that lower income customer.","It's just on enough to make a change in your shopping habits. And at the same time they've seen lower gasoline prices. They've seen higher food prices. They've seen higher rent prices. They've seen higher healthcare costs. They've seen higher taxes. So they are still concerned, they are still under pressure.","The concept of Dollar Tree and at Family Dollar of serving those people is serving as well. You know at Dollar Tree we've said that we are right for all times. We have great products that people need everyday, consumer products and things you've got to buy to have, things you have to have every day and the price is only a dollar.","Alongside things that may be discretionary that you'd like to have, but everything is a dollar. So through good times and difficult times we've tended to do very well, usually better than the market at Dollar Tree.","At Family Dollar with that low income customer the more we focus on what the lower income customer needs, offering the great value, improving our in-stock, giving the better shopping experience, exceeding their expectations when they go into our stores, the better serve we're going to be especially during difficult times, because that lower income customer really needs as at Family Dollar and at Dollar Tree in order to make ends meet throughout the month.","So that\u2019s your question, I mean, I think they are grateful that gasoline prices are lower, but not much else is in their world, and they've got to come a long way really to get their head back above water many of them.","Paul Trussell","Fair enough. Thank you. Good luck.","Bob Sasser","You know in closing, I just like to make one comment sort of in regard to that last question. I'll close with this, but as a combined organization, both banners, our focus is on growing our earnings power for years to come. There is a lot of things that we're doing right now that are in regard to giving us position and for the future.","Our decisions are always with our eyes on the horizon, but managing in real time, so what you're going to see from us is, our decisions are going to be made for the longer term and I'm not telling you it's going to take forever to bring value, I'm just saying our decisions are based on building this large entity combining two great banners for the long-term.","But we are dedicated to managing the business in real time and that means every month, every day, every quarter it means every expense line of the P&L, it means looking at our customer in the eye and trying to deliver the product that they need from us, identifying the position that we hold in the market using our size and our leverage to offer the greatest values for that customer.","So we're going to do both. And I think I'd like to tell you that Mike, my expectations as we're going to continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. You know this is the first full quarter that we've had the combined company. I think we had one month in the last earnings release.","But it\u2019s a first full quarter that we've had and we shown improvement. And some slight improvement mind you, but improvement. And I think I would tell you that I expect that to continue quarter-over-quarter, we'll show improvement. We're going to share with you all the information\u2019s that we know that is pertinent to where we are going with this thing.","We're not going to surprise anybody with it. But we're not going to give you information until we can absolutely get our arms around it and share with you how that looks going forward.","So thank you for your time and before I turn it back to Randy, I just want to say, thank you for your support and hope everybody has a great Thanksgiving.","Randy Guiler","Our next quarterly earnings call is currently scheduled for Tuesday, March 1, 2016.

Good morning, everyone. This morning we announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. With the closing of the Family Dollar transaction on July the 6th, this is our first sales and earnings report for the combined company. This report include one month of Family Dollar sales and operations combined with a full quarter of Dollar Tree performance. All Family Dollar stores are reported as new stores.","In the Dollar Tree segment of our business same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7%. This is on top of a 4.5% increase than second quarter of last year. Sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket with traffic increasing the most. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations the same-store sales increase was 2.4%. Total sales at Dollar Tree stores for the second quarter grew 8.3% to $2.2 billion; this was at the mid point of our previously announced guidance of $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion. ","Adjusted operating income increased by $22.4 million, or 10.5% to $234.9 million and adjusted operating margin for the quarter improved 20 basis points to 10.7% compared to 10.5% from the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment increased 10.1% to $138.9 million. And adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 9.8% to $0.67 compared with second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings of $0.61 per diluted share. This was near the top end of our previously announced guidance of $0.63 to $0.68 per diluted share. ","I am extremely pleased with the consistent growth in strength of the Dollar Tree business. This was our 30th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Second quarter result continue to validate relevance of the Dollar Tree brand, customers are shopping with us more often, we are attracting new customers everyday and when the customers are in the store they are buying more, both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter..","Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budget. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchants do a great job sourcing products that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements. And our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our merchandize values are better than ever and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector.","Seasonal energy was high in May beginning with Mothers' Day in addition to party essentials our stores were well stocked with card gifts, gift bag, balloons and candy for mom. Seasonal sale through was good and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes and celebration surrounding Memorial Day, picnics pools, beaches and summer fun. Reflecting the seasonal strength of Mothers' Day and Memorial Day, May was the strongest month for comp store sales in the quarter. For the full quarter, same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products. Top performing categories include candy and food, party, snacks and beverage and household supplies. ","Geographically Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was the strongest in the Southwest followed by the Midwest, Southeast, Northeast and West Coast. All five geographic zones produced positive same-store sales in the quarter. ","We continue to invest in our customers by offering unbelievable values on many name brands and bonus buys especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. And not to forget the basic throughout the quarter we continue to highlight our million dollar brands with signage and special displays of those everyday items that provide terrific value to our customers. ","Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores. In the second quarter, we opened a total of 130 new stores and relocated or expanded 27 stores for a total of 157 projects. The new stores included the 121 US Dollar Tree stores, 3 Dollar Tree Canada stores and two Deal stores. Additionally, on August 1st, we hosted grand openings at the first four of our re-bannered Family Dollar to Dollar Tree stores. Total Dollar Tree square footage increased 7.8%. We ended the quarter with 5,583 stores and we are on track with our plan for fiscal 2015 which includes 400 new stores, 75 relocations and expansions for total of 475 projects across the US and Canada. ","In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive the business initiatives include category expansions where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. ","Seasonal relevance, our storefronts change with the season. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the season at the $1 price point. Merchandize energy and thrill of the hunt throughout of the store at Dollar Tree, you will always find an expected value. And being first of the month ready, we place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs. ","Additionally, we are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezer and coolers in 159 additional stores for a total of 255 additional stores year-to-date. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,875 stores and we continue to grow.","Frozen and refrigerated merchandize is generally lower margin but its faster turning, more frequently purchased and increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories including our higher margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the need of our customers. We continue to support planned growth by building infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We've recently began construction of Dollar Tree DC 11, a 1.5 million square foot automated facility in Cherokee County, South Carolina. This facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable store growth in the South Eastern and Mid Atlantic US. We plan to have the facility operational in third quarter of 2016.","I am extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in second quarter. Our Dollar Tree business continues to deliver operating margins that lead the value retail sector, our customer base is large and growing, both traffic and average ticket increased in second quarter. We have an experienced and talented merchandizing team that continues to do a tremendous job of finding and delivering terrific values to our customers with margin that meet our threshold. In second quarter, merchandize margin increased over the prior year. We announced and began construction on Dollar Tree DC 11 and we completed the acquisition of Family Dollar immediately transitioning from integration planning to integration execution of the two companies. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization. I am more enthusiastic than ever about the opportunity this merger presents for our customers, our suppliers, our associates and our shareholders. With the successful completion of the acquisition of Family Dollar on July 6, we are now much larger and more diverse organization, able to benefit from scale and deliver even greater values. With more than 13,800 stores across North America supported by a solid and scalable infrastructure, this combination provides the unique opportunity to leverage our multiple banners to better serve a broader range of customers while enhancing our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.","We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of the third year post closing. These synergies will be driven through four primary avenues. Sourcing and procurement, our rebranded program for optimizing store formats, distribution and logistics, and fourth overhead and corporate SG&A. As previously stated we expect to spend approximately $300 million in one time costs to achieve these synergies. Our priority areas of focus for Family Dollar will be on first of all the customer. We will be evolving the merchandize assortments to increase value and better meet their needs. The customer experience, creating a more exciting, inviting and customer friendly shopping environment. Lowering field management turnover, supporting our store initiatives and developing a more performance based culture throughout the company and increasing store productivity; we will be modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity in existing stores while improving new store remodel and expansion performance.","Our 100 day action plan includes seven key initiatives. First of all, communicating organizational leadership changes and establishing management cadence and coordination. As planned effective on day one, Gary Philbin, my business partner for the past 15 years took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar and Mike Witynski was promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer at Dollar Tree. Immediately we began standing up work groups and establishing our weekly and monthly cadence across banner meetings. We began defining coordinated merchandize planning and buying across banners. We are consolidating reporting and financial management tools. We've created a stub-year plan to align the Family Dollar calendar with the Dollar Tree retail calendar by the end of the year. We are developing a combined real estate review and approval process. Our goal is to put the right banner in the right location to best serve the customer and to ensure we are using an appropriate pro form analysis with appropriate hurdle rates for profitability. We are completing our compensation and organization leveling review bringing both organizations to a common title hierarchy with a common compensation and benefit plan and the common calendar. ","Second, we immediately kicked our plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies. One of our largest synergy opportunities is using our size, scale and efficiency to buy better. We currently spend about $10 billion on items for resale and another $3 billion for products and services we buy for use in the business. Immediately following closing, our merchandizing teams met to share detail cost information to identify and quantify specific opportunities and to develop a strategic action plan to obtain the best cost in both banners. The cost of good sold initiative is focused in three primary areas. The first area is aligning exact match products carried by both companies and obtaining the lowest cost for both banners. Second is a review of similar match products. Here our merchants are aligning specifications and combining purchasing power to reduce cost. Third is payment term parity, which will benefit the combined company with savings from harmonizing payment terms. The plans have been developed, the initiative has launched and we are well on our way to achieving our goals of reducing cost to good sold. ","Additionally, our procurement teams are addressing our indirect spend. These are items and services that we buy that are used in the business. The opportunity to use our size and efficiency to reduce cost is significant. These items and services have been grouped into waves to be addressed over time through a blend of negotiations, auctions, RFPs and form of bid processes. This process has also begun and we are on track to achieve our first 100 day goal. ","Third, we have officially kicked off our store rebanner process. We are very excited about the opportunity to rebanner store locations to better server our customers while improving the overall productivity of these individual stores. Our initial focus will be transforming hundreds of underperforming Family Dollar stores into Dollar Tree stores. Using the Dollar Tree real estate model we are reviewing underperforming Family Dollar stores to determine if they would perform profitability as Dollar Tree stores. Upon closing we immediately began the process to rebanner four test stores. The test was to validate that we had all of the necessary steps in place to facilitate a smooth conversion. The individual stores closed for approximately two weeks as we liquidate the Family Dollar merchandize, convert the d\u00e9cor, signing and fixtures, train the store teams and bring in the Dollar Tree inventory. These first four test stores reopened on August 1st less than four weeks following the completion of the acquisition. While very early in the process, these stores experienced successful grand openings as Dollar Tree stores. ","We have since rebannered and opened 39 more for a total of 43 stores as of last Friday, August 28th with similar grand opening results. Going forward, we've developed a list of stores to be rebannered each week through the end of October and assuming continued success, we will reengage these efforts in 2016. By the end of October, we expect to have more than 150 stores converted. We are very pleased with the process and with early results, feedback from customers in these markets has been positive. Fourth and first 100 days we plan to establish cross organizational IT access and finalize our initial technology integration strategy. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have very good technology platforms and there are no significant gaps or immediate needs. Through our integration planning, we've developed a roadmap to strategically combine our technology over time. The timing of these changes will be driven by the size of achievable synergies versus the expected cost. Our current plan or roadmap includes four primary phases. Immediately in Phase one, we are addressing back office system consolidations. Phase two addresses system alignment related to transportation, workforce and HR support and business intelligence. Phase three addresses consolidation of core merchandizing systems including forecasting and replenishment. And Phase four addresses projects related to distribution and center management point of sale and real estate. This we are developing and initiated and plan to better serve the Family Dollar customers and to build sales momentum. ","Raising the table stake is a key priority and a significant opportunity in our integration efforts. Our first 100 day plans include clearing aged and non-productive inventory while improving our in-stock position on everyday basis. This includes reclaiming prime space for impactful displays for our fourth quarter seasonal and promotional assortment. And continuing the analysis of productivity by category. Sixth, we will be finalizing supply chain roadmap and initiating the multi banner supply chain project. Working with a cross banner functional team and third party supply chain consultant, we are developing plans for integrating our warehouse management systems. And making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing our space need by banner and determining our ability to ship both banners at of each facility. This is a very large project with a very significant opportunity for long-term synergies. Seventh, we are further developing and initiating plans to reduce cost with a shared services model. Over time we will be combining our efforts to support both banners with a shared service organization and human resources, finance, information technology, logistics, legal, strategy and audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization while reducing cost.","This is a high level overview. Some of the components of our 100 day action plan. There are some quick and easy wins here and some that we will take a great deal of work. The timing of some will be depended on our IT integration. Our strategy is not to touch everything at once but to prioritize our areas of focus to get it right the first time and build the overall business for the long term. It is a process it will take time but the size of the prize is worth it. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015. ","Kevin Wampler","Thanks, Bob and good morning. As Bob mentioned, we are pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter. The Dollar Tree segment performed well within the range of guidance that we provided. As a result of the acquisition, year-over-year comparison for the next four quarters will be more complex than normal since there is no prior year data for the Family Dollar segment. ","Total sales for the second quarter grew 48.3% to $3.01 billion which includes four weeks of Family Dollar sales. Excluding the $812 million in Family Dollar sales the Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.3%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.7% versus a strong 4.5% in the prior year second quarter. Increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 2.4%. Please note that all of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered are considered new stores and are not included in our same-store sales calculation. ","Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $161.1 million, or 23.2%, to $855.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year's quarter. Majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar gross profit of $105.9 million. A few factors to note are: as a result of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition, a preliminary purchase accounting adjustment of $116.3 million was recorded for the step-up in basis of Family Dollar inventory to its fair value. Of this amount, $55 million is amortizable of which $11.1 million was amortized during the second quarter to cost of good sold and negatively impacted gross margin results. We expect an additional $38.1 million will be amortized to cost of good sold over the remaining six months of 2015. During the second quarter we also took a $60 million markdown reserve for SKU rationalization and planned liquidation related to Family Dollar inventory that will not be carried going forward. ","Gross profit margin for Dollar Tree segment was 34.1% during the second quarter compared with 34.2% in the prior year second quarter. The 10 basis point decline as a percent of sale was driven by higher shrink and occupancy cost partially offset by improved merchandize cost. ","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 49.7% to $731.8 million from $489 million in last year second quarter. Majority of the $242.7 million increase related to $200.9 million of Family Dollar expense which included $6.5 million for the amortization of favorable lease rights recorded in connection with the acquisition and $6.5 million of additional deprecation for the harmonization of the combined company policies. For the second quarter we incurred $17.7 million, or 55 basis points of expenses related to the Family Dollar acquisition compared to $7.5 million, or 35 basis point of acquisition expenses in the second quarter of 2014. As a percent of sales SG&A expense increased 20 basis points to 24.3% in the second quarter from 24.1% in the same quarter last year. Excluding SG&A cost expenses as a percent of sales was consistent with the prior year at 23.7%. Adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment was $514.4 million, or 23.4% of sales. As a percent of sales this represent a 30 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2014 adjusted SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment of 23.7%. The decrease was driven by improved store labor productivity, lower incentive comp and lower legal fees as a percent of sales. ","Operating income for the combined organization increased to $123.4 million compared with $205 million in the same period last year. This decrease is a result of lower gross profit margin and higher SG&A expenses as previously mentioned. ","Adjusted operating income for the Dollar Tree segment increased $22.4 million to $234.9 million, or 10.7% of sales compared to 10.5% of sales in the prior second quarter. ","Non-operating expenses for the second quarter totaled $265.6 million and were comprised of the following. A $1.7 million expense due to an unfavorable fair market value adjustment on diesel fuel swaps, and net interest expense of $263.9 million in the quarter compared to $8.4 million in the prior year second quarter. This increase included interest on the long-term debt for the acquisition and $89.5 million breakage fee related to the prepayment of the Dollar Tree senior notes and a $39.5 million prepayment fee related to the term loan B refinancing. A $17.4 million write -off original issue of discount and $5.9 million write-off of deferred financing cost related to the term loan B refinancing.","The quarterly run rate for interest expense going forward will be approximately $100 million including deferred financing cost and amortization. For the second quarter, the company had a net loss of $98 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. Excluding acquisition related adjustments the company had net income of $53.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share. ","Adjusted net income for the Dollar Tree segment was $138.9 million, or $0.67 per adjusted diluted share, a 9.8% increase when compared to the reported adjusted earning per share of $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year second quarter. ","Effective tax rate for the second quarter was a benefit of 31.1% compared to an expense of 38.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of pretax income loss in the quarter and the non deductible acquisition cost. ","Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, combined cash and cash equivalent at quarter end totaled $1.3 billion compared to $467.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2014. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 6.7% greater than at the same time last year while selling per footage increased 7.8%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 1%. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support schedule new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. ","Consolidated capital expenditures were $100.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 versus $88.3 million in the second quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $600 million to $615 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels including additional fee development stores, rebanner of select Family Dollar stores and to Dollar Tree stores. The addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 425 Dollar Tree stores, up from the previous expectation of 320. IT system enhancements and the construction of our new Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution centre. ","Depreciation and amortization totaled $89.5 million for the second quarter versus $49.9 million in the second quarter last year. For 2015, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $470 million to $490 million. This range includes increases over the traditional run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for two items. First it includes $46 million of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the two companies and the increase in the value of assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, it includes $45 million for the amortization of favorable lease right for the purchase price evaluation of Family Dollar leases. ","For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $4.78 billion to $4.87 billion. For the full year of 2015 we are now estimating total sales will range from $15.3 billion to $15.52 billion. Both of these estimates are based on low single digit same store sales increase. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 235.7 million shares for Q3 and 223.5 million shares for the full year. ","Our expectations for the Dollar Tree segment of our business in the back half have not materially changed from our original expectation as we entered the year. However, as a result of the recently completed acquisition, the significant integration initiatives and the divestiture process, we are not providing earnings per share guidance for the third quarter or full year at this time. ","I'd like to reiterate that our same-store sales calculation excludes recently acquired Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that rebannered from Family Dollar to the Dollar Tree. We will experience some degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comp as part of rebanner effort. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebanner strategy analysis and outlook for same store sales in the back half of 2015. ","I'd like to briefly speak to the divestiture process. Related to our acquisition, we've reached an agreement to divest 330 Family Dollar stores to Sycamore Partners to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission divestiture requirements. These 330 stores represent approximately $45.5 million in annual operating income. We are on schedule to close on divestiture sale later this year. The closing of the divestiture transaction will not change our future net assets because the net effect of the divestiture on Dollar Tree assets and liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet and Form 10-Q being filed today. The divestiture will have two effects on future income. In addition to losing the operating income associated with these 330 stores, we also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in transaction closing costs, and setup costs related to transition services. Over a period expected to be no more than 24 months we will be providing certain support and transition services and expect to be reimburse by the buyer for these direct operating costs and support services. ","I'll now turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Kevin. It is an exciting time for Dollar Tree. The strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is more compelling than ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction evolving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers. The largest of any previous retail merger and it will take some time. It is early in integration process and is more enthusiastic than ever about the long-term opportunity to provide substantially increase shareholder value. We've great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year three. These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering cost in both direct and in-direct sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and over head. We will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We are confident that placing our initial emphasis on these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvement in sales margin, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. ","Before we go to Q&A I'd like to introduce Gary Philbin to our call, effected immediately upon closing, Gary took over as President and Chief Operating Officer at Family Dollar. This is a key role that has been vacant for about 18 months and the organization was in need of direction and leadership following the lengthy acquisition process. Many of you already know Gary. We worked together improving and growing the Dollar Tree business for the past 15 years. And I have tremendous confidence in his ability as a retailer and as a leader. Gary? ","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Bob. And good morning, everyone. First let me say we are only eight weeks into the integration. And we are enthusiastic about the initial progress and this incredible opportunity ahead of us. I am pleased with the dedication and focus of the entire Family Dollar team. As you know, Family Dollar is a well established brand that has been successful for more than 50 years. I think our Family Dollar business is not broken. We simply need to roll up our sleeves, focus on what's important and we have the work to do polish up this well known brand.","Bob provided a high level, strategic overview of our 100 day action plan. I'd like to provide greater detail into the execution components in our areas of focus on improving the Family Dollar's customer shopping experience. Our goal is to consistently provide great value, affordable prices and relevant items in a store environment as convenient, clean, reliable and productive. To accomplish this goal, we are going to build on four basic fundamentals. Great product value, well run stores, smart choices for our customers and consistency of in-stock on everyday items. Nothing I said here is new to retail. This is really retail 101. We are focused on consistent execution combined with our relentless focus on our customer. It is important to understand that we will be making investments to improve what we refer to table stakes and these investments will include delivering on the consistency of a clean store benchmark, catching up on deferred maintenance, investing in the right amount of payroll to drive both productivity and enhance the customer experience and improving the overall efficiency of our in-store processes. Importantly, we are kicking off our process to clear non go forward merchandize in the stores. So you are likely to see clearance activity over the next couple of months as we gear up for having our shelf stock with basic everyday items and to show off our great seasonal product. This will have an impact on margins near term, but it is absolutely the right thing to do for our business in the long-term.","Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I jus want to say again, I am proud to be part of the Family Dollar team. I am pleased with the work being done and I am excited about the opportunities this will present both to our vendor community and our Family Dollar team members as we improve and grow the Family Dollar brand. Now let me turn it back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Gary. I want to close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever providing extreme value to customers while recording record level of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 30 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. With the addition of Family Dollar, we are larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more market with exactly what they are looking for, great value in every store every day. And we have many years of growth ahead of us. Over the past three weeks I have had the privilege to attend and present at both Family Dollar's Annual Leadership Conference and Dollar Tree's Annual Field Management Meeting. I could not be more proud of our combined organization. Our field management and our leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. ","Operator, we are now ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question we will hear from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys; Scot Ciccarelli. A couple things. Can you help us better understand the moving pieces on the Family Dollar side? It looks like even after adjusting for the charges, Kevin, that you outlined, gross margins was dramatically lower than their historical run rate. So whether it's kind of giving us year-over-year comparable figures or a way to kind of build up a bridge to what might be a go-forward run rate number, thanks.","Kevin Wampler","I think the big thing we got to keep in mind is there are some geography difference in the way we have historically reported our gross profit and the way the Family Dollar has. So you got to remember within our gross margin we have occupancy and distribution cost up there. So within that change has been made to Family Dollar reporting on a go forward basis. So that's probably the biggest difference that you'd see from a comparability standpoint from what it traditionally had been reported at Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. And then -- I'll follow up on that. Then also as you guys kind of think about Family Dollar -- maybe this is for Gary -- it's obviously been an underperforming asset for the last couple years. It sounds like you guys have a lot of kind of go-forward opportunities to fix the business deep into the plans. But when you think about the profitability opportunity of that entity on a standalone basis, do you guys have some sort of medium-term or long-term profitability targets for the Family Dollar segment?","Gary Philbin","Hey, Scot. Thank you. I'd just say this we know the synergy piece that we are working on and this is going to be a bit of marathon, not a sprint. But the same things that we've talked about over the years that Dollar Tree play pretty nicely into Family Dollar. And I'd just go back to some of the basics we are working on. We are walking the assortments in the store 4 feet by 4 feet to get the assortment right and we are taking a look at store operations to understand how we improve their processes that drive productivity. And we are going to take a very hard look at all of our expense line so we can fund those things and we can invest in the customer experience. So it is really just connecting the same dots you heard us preach over the years here at Dollar Tree and those are going to be the levers we push to drive to the bottom line. ","Bob Sasser","Scot, I'd like to add too that you mentioned the short term versus long term, I'd tell you this is -- we are going to manage this in the short term but it is a long-term vision that I am really excited about. It wasn't that long ago that Family Dollar's margins were in the 8% and higher range, operating margin and certainly those are in the -- in our near term sites over the next few years. In the long term, there are others in the sector that are operating at 11%, 12% operating margin. I don't think the operating margin will be as high as the Dollar Tree operating margin because of the nature of our business, the nature of our consumable versus non-consumable and discretionary business. But certainly can be as up there amongst others in the discount value sector.","Scot Ciccarelli","Bob, just to clarify, did you say you would expect or believe you can get the Family Dollar business to kind of an 8% margin over the next few years as you guys integrate it?","Bob Sasser","I just said that it wasn't that many years ago that it was at that, so certainly one of our first goals is to get it from where it is now up to where it has been in recent years. And then past that, there is no reason why we can't polish this thing up and get it back to its proper place which would be up there at the top with others of the same type business. ","Operator","And the next we will move to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Hey, thanks for taking the question. I think previously you had mentioned a low to mid-single-digit accretion to cash EPS in the first year from the acquisition, which I guess would now be fiscal 2016. Is that still on the table? Or has anything changed in your thought process as you've been able to maybe open the kimono a bit?","Kevin Wampler","As we look at that on a go forward basis, we've stated that back in July of 2014, obviously things took obviously a lot longer to close the deal than would have been expected when we made that. The Family Dollar business deteriorated little bit over that timeframe but time will tell, we don't think it is not possible. There is a lot of moving pieces. And the other thing you got to remember is long term we are really more worried about what the acquisition does for the long term. So we\u2019ll have to see. I don't exactly know today if it will be, there is a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, we spoke to a lot of things today about some of the short-term effects from a purchase accounting standpoint, some of those things. And again some of those are non-cash; some of those do go through the P&L as a regular charge. So a lot of moving pieces and that's what makes it as complex as it is as we go forward from a comparison standpoint. ","Stephen Grambling","Okay, thanks. I guess one other clarification just on the Family Dollar business. Is there anything you can talk to in terms of the underlying health and trajectory of that business and how that's factored into the sales plan for the year? Thanks so much.","Kevin Wampler","As we looked at it from a sales perspective as the Family Dollar team looked at that business, I think it really consistent with the guidance we gave of a low single digit comp gain that's really for the Dollar Tree side because the comps - and Family Dollar stores are not comped but I think in the back of our mind is the reason why they can't in a sense for focus in and perform at a level like that going forward. So I mean I think that's just kind of a general nature. We expect improvement and obviously we got to go through some processes, we talked about the fact that $60 million reserve to clean up the inventory for non go forward items, so there will be process there. We hope that obviously opens up shelf space as we go forward for seasonal goods as we go into fourth quarter and other items that we believe are important to the assortment as we go forward. So a lot of work being done and lot of moving pieces. ","Stephen Grambling","Thanks so much. Good luck in the back half. Looking forward to seeing that 8% margin.","Kevin Wampler ","Not in the back half. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.","Matt Nemer","Good morning, everyone. Given your comments about the product value that you're looking to install in the FDO stores, I'm wondering if you think that the FDO merchandise margins need to be structurally lower than they have been in the past?","Bob Sasser","I'd say that I don't know that it\u2019s -- they need to be structurally lower, I think it is all about the assortment to some degree serving that value customer, a lot of things go into that, first of all being competitive on name brands for same items between our company and other. We need to do that as always that just sort of one of the table stakes and past there is about the mix, is how do you create value especially for that low income customer, there is big opportunity with private label, there is a big opportunity for controlled label, there is a big opportunity for product development to create even more value for that low end customer. So as we speak of serving a low end customer and bring value to that customer, there is more than one way to do it. And it is not all about the price on name brand product. It is many ways about understanding that customer, giving them what they need; sometimes it is a lower retail item that doesn\u2019t speak to the margin though, it speaks to the opening price point for that customer. So, no, I won't tell you that I expect Family Dollar margins to be lower because we are serving the value customer, I think it is all about the way we bring value to that customer.","Matt Nemer","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you talk to the stability of the FDO store managers and the field teams, now that you're kind of into the integration process?","Gary Philbin ","We actually had a chance or timing is everything but we had a chance to went follow myself, get in front of the entire district manager leadership team at the beginning of August, so we had a great opportunity to lay out the elements that are important to us and what's we need short term focus on as we head into the holidays. So it was really a great opportunity to talk about what we need to do with our core store manage turnover is on our radar and something that we need to improve at Family Dollar. And so those issues and elements were lay down in front of the entire group. I'd tell you if they are encouraged, they are positive, they are enthusiastic to move forward and I think that's going to carry over to the stores and really some of the things that we are going to invest in over time in the facilities and address issues that make us more productive, and the types of things that benefit store manager. So I am encouraged. I think our folks have taken the opportunity and are going to carry it forward for us. And I'd expect to see improvement on store manager turnover which does a lot of good things for us over the long term. ","Matt Nemer","That's great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And next we move on to Michael Lasser with UBS. ","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So aside from some of the inventory dynamics that you mentioned, what else is going to impact your outlook from a profitability perspective in second half of the year? Because I think it is complex, and the fact that it is being left so open-ended may offer the impression that there's too many moving pieces for even the company to project. So how can the investment community be expected to forecast profitability?","Kevin Wampler","Well, I think in Gary's prepared remarks he touched on some of the items as you think about the moving pieces are still under consideration. When you think about the fact that we've only truly been under the hood eight weeks but and Gary talked about investments in cleaner store and the benchmark appropriately. Cleaning up deferred maintenance, making sure the stores are taken care of appropriately, determining what the right level of payroll is in this model to drive productivity and create a more profitable store at the end of today. So there are still a lot of moving pieces just from the integration side and then you have as well I said you have timing on the divestiture process side as well. Some point in time these 330 stores will be -- that are currently included in our base will go away and then we also have cost around that to help support that as we said and so the timing of those costs are not as they able be to be tied down maybe as tight at this moment as we would like. So there is a lot of moving pieces. I think we know what they are but it does create little more uncertainty in creating a number. I mean we are taking great pride and being able to provide credible guidance. And that's important to us. And we want to make sure that we have the best information to make those -- to be able to make that and give that to you at the end of the day.","Michael Lasser","So my follow-up is going to be a two-part follow-up. Based on those comments it sounds like the prior guidance for core Dollar Tree remains relatively intact on the profitability side. And the guidance, your commentary on the guidance also suggests that core Dollar Tree is probably going to do a 1% to 1.5% comp in the second half of the year to get to a low-single-digit comp for the year; and it also sounds like that's what it did in June and July based on what you were indicating that may have done. So my question is, A, core profitability for Dollar Tree intact and B, why might you be expecting a 1% to 1.5% comp for core Dollar Tree moving forward? And is that what we should expect longer term? Thank you.","Kevin Wampler","So look you are correct on core Dollar Tree profitability as I said in my prepared remarks, our view point on really the guidance we gave for Dollar Tree is most updated guidance which would have been at the end of Q1, really hasn't materially changed from that point in time, our view on the world is not really changed. As it relates to your question on comp, obviously we don't give a specific range by number value but low single digit is a wider range than 1.5 so I don't know we would expect 1.5 at the end of the day. So I think that would be how we would how we would answer that question. ","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you so much and good luck.","Operator","And next move on to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Bob, I know that there is a lot of science involved in determining locations for Dollar Tree stores. When you look at the Family Dollar stores that have been selected for conversions, how would you characterize the quality of their locations by Dollar Tree standards? And do you think those stores have the potential to generate the same sales per square foot and operating margin rate that an average Dollar Tree store achieves? Or would you expect these converted stores to be somewhat below Dollar Tree profit standards?","Bob Sasser","Dan, I'd tell you that the first the Family Dollar site location I think that they are good site location. Some of them are little off the mark. And they are underperforming for that reason. As you know that over the past few years, I think they opened up a few more in suburban locations than maybe normal, I don't know if that what normal was but it seems like what has been told is that they were aiming more suburban locations. We see more suburban locations. And as we run those lower performing store, we are binding some of those world and suburban locations that are underperforming. That when we run through our model, they turned out to be good Dollar Tree stores and good Dollar Tree meet our Dollar Tree criteria for opening a new Dollar Tree stores. These are not -- these are sites that we would open as a Dollar Tree new store and we have been looking at those locations. So what we are taking is the lower performing stores or either lower performing because of their maybe little off the Family Dollar mark, they are lower performing because maybe the model, the pro forma weren't exactly aligned and by the way with our Dollar Tree margin, we can make a lot of money in a location, our margins are much higher than these Family Dollar margins are mixed of products is much different than the Family Dollar products. So long answer to your question but these are -- we are looking at these being good Dollar Tree stores. We are taking lowest performing and low performing Family Dollar, converting them into good Dollar Tree stores. Some of them are going to be breakout home run amongst the best of our Dollar Tree stores on sales per foot and some of them are likely going to be underperforming the first year. I believe that the breakout home runs will outweigh. We are early in this but I believe the breakout home runs will outweigh the underperformers and that most of them are going to be right there in the middle hitting whatever we expected from a Dollar Tree store. It is only been few weeks. We've only had some grand opening so far. But I'd tell you I am pleased with the grand opening and I visited the first four test stores when we opened them, I visit all four of them and they look like Dollar Tree stores and they look like Dollar Tree locations and they are in Dollar Tree town, customers were pleased to see our Dollar Tree open up in the place of the Family Dollar. So I am expecting to be at least as good as a Dollar Tree store. ","Dan Wewer","All right. This is a follow-up question. After the acquisition was first announced -- it seems like 10 years ago -- but you talked about the opportunities of better buying leverage, common vendors. But it really wasn't until after the closing on July 6 that you were able to study the Family Dollar purchasing file if I am correct. Did it turn out that the buying leverage would be greater than what you have been talking about over the last year? Or did it turn out both companies were very effective in buying and maybe there's not going to be as much upside as anticipated?","Bob Sasser","Yes. I think it is at least as good in the near term. And I think there are may be even more opportunity in the long term. And where I am coming from as we sort of a new and the near term and we got very quickly to that exact match number. That's just a matter of running the file and in which items serve exactly the same and who is paying lowest price right? I mean somebody is paying, you're either paying the same or somebody is paying lower. If you are paying lower than we believe that both of us deserve that lower cost. That was pretty much as we thought it would be. The big I think power going forward in addition to that is going to be into the like items. Not exactly the same items but they are close that maybe a private label item that we compared too and expects a little difference of by aligning the specs and putting that out for bid but if it is basic item we think we know we can drive some more value by combining our buying power these two large businesses on those into product development just leveraging our buying power to develop product for our stores whether a Dollar Tree or Family Dollar. So huge opportunities continuing on the buying side. The near term is the exact match. The near match or the closed match like items I guess is taking a little bit longer but it may even be a bigger part of the synergies as we go forward. And they are not yet all the things that we buy that we don't sell, we just buying expense items and services and things that we buy to use, we spent $3 billion that we have to work with and every dollar we save on expenses drop right straight to the bottom line.","Dan Wewer","Just a real quick question. Do you intend going forward to continue breaking out the Dollar Tree core business separately as you get into the second quarter?","Kevin Wampler ","We will try to get color, we are -- if you look at the Q, there is segment reporting even in the press release this segment reporting, so we will report on two segments. We will have the Dollar Tree banner and we will have the Family Dollar banner. So we will have segment reporting going forward. We will give you good idea of how things are performing. ","Operator","And next we move on to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. Bob, you just spoke a bit to buying power and the opportunity there. Can you just clarify for us on the merchant team? Are those merchants still staying separate? And also how should we think about the category mix within FDO? Or should we expect meaningful changes there? Then lastly on that same point, as we think about the cadence of the $300 million in synergies, can you help us with what's a prudent assumption for year one? And what is the main driver of those year-one synergy?","Bob Sasser","Yes. Paul, the first of all the buying teams are staying separate. We have a terrific Dollar Tree buying team that's understands and is focused on delivering tremendous value to our Dollar Tree customer for a $1 price and margins that we are pleased to have. We have at Family Dollar a separate team focused on that lower income customer, the need based customer or more of consumer product customers 70 percent-ish something like that is consumer product, so the buying teams are staying separate. We are connecting them over the top through merchandize managers and divisional vice presidents and that area we are coordinating a buying with vendors. We are coordinating the activities on items and comparing buying plans and merchandize as we go on to buying trips as we go to Asia, as we go to market and wherever it is New York, going to shows and that kind of things. So a lot of coordination but we -- I believe it is very important to keep the focus clearly on the Family Dollar banner. We intend to continue opening Family Dollar stores as well as Dollar Tree stores. Sometimes they are pretty close to each other. So I'd like to be able to do that and have a very difference in the banners when you walk inside, have a difference in merchandize assortment. So the merchandize assortment at Family Dollar is evolving. It will be changing as I've discussed in the past the synergies -- I think we've said in the past 25% of the synergies in first year, we think we can get up to 75% of them by the end of the second full year and then 100% by the end of the three full year, so that's something like 75%, 150%, 75% something like that, 150% additional second year, 75% to 225% and 300% if you look at it that way. Then the early synergies are across the board. They are going to be a lot of sourcing and procurement. There will be some in banner optimization; I have said that we are going to do over 150 banner, new rebannering stores this year. So that's a real number. Over head we are working through that in every segment of our business. I mean that's going to be driven by our information technology integration. Some of it requires the integration of the technology for example in logistics, the ability shift both banners out of every building is going to require lot of technology help. So that will be probably later in the process, earlier in the process are the things about over head and improvements in SG&A through better procurement, more efficient procurement and through buying power. ","Paul Trussell","That's very helpful. Thank you for the color. Just quickly going back to Dollar Tree standalone -- and I think Mike Lasser touched on this earlier. But could you just help us better understand the revision in the same-store sales guidance from the low-single-digit, to low\/mid-single-digit, to now I think just low single digit guidance for the full year. What was the nature of that revision and if you can give us some understanding on the cadence of the comp through the second quarter and any early comments on back to school.","Bob Sasser","I can give you little color on the cadence of the comp. I initially said in the prepared remarks that May driven by couple of terrific holidays Mothers' Day, Memorial Day. You have that seasonal energy that holiday excitement, so that grow the highest comps for us. June was far behind; July was run pretty much consistent. We did lose first two to the month to end of July week, so some of that business slip forward anytime the first of the month falls on the weekend then checks come out in a different cadence in this case versus last year, all I came out at the first and the third came out last year this only the first checks came out. So there was a little slide in that final week of July. But overall it was fairly consistent through the quarter and again every time there is a great holiday we have a lot of energy in our Dollar Tree stores and you see more traffic and you see more sales from the holiday. Back to school started well, it is not over. One of the things that we are experiencing as well as all of retail I guess right now is Labor Day is a week later. Labor Day drives a lot of things in the retail business. It drives seasonal sales sort of the end of the summer I guess the pools close end of the summer for retailers, for customers and that's when a lot of the school start, some school run here around are realized some start different times, but still a large percentage of school start after Labor Day. Well, that's week later this year. So the sales cadence on our back to school looks good. But we still got haven't finished with back to school yet. So we will be finishing that up this weekend. It should be a terrific weekend in our Dollar Tree stores. If you have one near, drop in, you will see a lot of side walk sales and summer excitement and all that goes within summer season as well as get read to go back to school. ","Operator","And we will move on to Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler","Hey, thanks very much for taking my question. Is there anything -- when you look at Family Dollar, I know you said that the delay in getting the deal approved put a little pressure on Family Dollar and made them a little softer. But is there anything that you've seen that comes as a surprise, specifically a negative surprise? And I guess I would go back to the question that was just asked. It does seem like your guidance for the second half for Dollar Tree's comp is a little bit softer. Is there anything -- is that right, softer than what it was? And is there anything you would point to that would explain why you feel that's going to be the case? Thanks.","Kevin Wampler","Meredith, as you look at the people seemed to be little hung up at the moment on this comp guidance. I'd tell you that the total sales related to Dollar Tree for the year have changed an immaterial amount within the guides compared to where they were a quarter ago. So one thing we did state in our prepared remarks was the fact that there is some cannibalization from the rebanner store and we are offset doing over 150, there is some cannibalization we feel from those and that may make us round down from mid-single digit to low-single digit, but I mean an overall basis. As I said we've not materially changed the way our view is on the Dollar Tree business for the back half. ","Meredith Adler","Good. That is what I was thinking you were saying, but people didn't seem to be hearing it. Maybe you could just comment on then Family Dollar. Is there anything that has surprised you either positive or negative, since you've really gotten into it?","Gary Philbin","Hi, Meredith, this is Gary. Sometime on the ground there I would say, listen, I am enthusiastic because there is all the opportunities that we thought were there are there. And it's really matter of getting them in cadence and teeing them up and knocking them down. And I would say there is nothing on the negative side. We knew going in, how you enhance a customer experience, that's investing in some labor, that's investing in some store facilities, and those are big projects for us. And so we are going to be measured in disciplined and very prescriptive on how we do that and that's really the effort that we are putting together now to really lay out on a timeline on how we can do the things and show customers it is a fair shopping experience because we have better in-stock, we've better facility and we have team efforts engaged the way we like. And it's really just the nuts and bolts of retail and so what we are focused on we can recount down Family Dollar right now. ","Meredith Adler","Well, that's great. Lots of luck. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have time for one more question. Next we will hear from Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder","Hi, it is Dan Binder. Just going back to the sales plan for a minute, I was wondering if you give us a little bit of color on how disruptive it is when you close the stores and have to convert them. These four weeks, it sounds like it is kind of worth year -- it was recently. Is that what you're planning for the balance of the year on the stores that are remaining? And then within the Family Dollar business, I realize you are not reporting the comp today for their period. But I was curious when you think about your go forward plan kind of what's that underlying organic growth that we are assuming short term. ","Bob Sasser","Dan, the first three bannered stores with the four that we rebannered that we started immediately after we closed July 6. We had the completely rebannered and open within 26 days so 30 days it is kind of what we are aiming at basically we closed in and go through a process ahead of time, we are selling through and liquidating the Family Dollar inventory. We then closed down for about two weeks, two more weeks to re-merchandize store, get the rest of the merchandize out there, get their old fixtures out, get the new fixtures in, and if you are already needed not always sometimes we use the same fixtures, get the new sign packages and the new d\u00e9cor package and re-merchandize the store. So it is about one month process and some of it starts ahead of time because we've identify the stores now at a time and we know which one we are going to do by month. So we do have a pre closing clearance, so Gary -- ","Gary Philbin","Dan, and just for the first four stores because we could not start markdown until we closed the transactions, they were accelerated. So the stores that we identify in the future and have -- give us a longer runway to appropriately do the markdown. So the first four really difference were we had to do this in a very short window, the team very well accomplished that and we got to the finish line. You will see a more measured timeline on the markdowns in the future. ","Dan Binder","The other part of the question was the organic growth for Family Dollar Stores as we think about the full-year guidance.","Bob Sasser","I'll tell you they were positive in July, comp positive in July but they are new stores so it is less of comp story now and more of productivity story and obviously we are going to be go through a lot of changes remainder of the year, we are so excited about cleaning up the store, we are so excited about go through the process and rationalizing the assortment, getting rid of old and aged inventory and then replacing that in the space that's opened up from that with new seasonal products, new promotional product, new high value product in the store and what that will do for the customers and it is all in fourth quarter and we want our customers to see something different. Gary you'd like to - ","Gary Philbin","Well, the short term is for us just to get very clearly in front of our cleaning up some of the old non go forward merchandize so that we can have merchandize on end-caps and the best seasonal impact as we can go to the important holiday season. From the standpoint of store growth initially there was a number around there around 550 on Family Dollar for their fiscal year, appropriately that drop down to about 300, so we have slowdown store growth as we take a look under the hood, take a look at the assortments to drive sales per square foot, I am sitting in on every real estate meeting to identify really what's the strategy, whether is it working or do we need to recalibrate, and so we will take a look on both side of that ledger, , where does Family Dollar work best and really more than anything how do we find the right compelling assortments and our operational initiatives to drive higher sales productivity. ","Dan Binder","Then just as a follow-up, can you give us a little more color on how many stores you'll ultimately plan to convert? And as you go through this integration, slower Family Dollar store growth makes sense. I'm just curious as you think about the next two years beyond this year. I think you just said 300 for this year. What would you anticipate that to look like?","Bob Sasser","Dan, it is 150, more than 150 this year. With as many as we can get done between now and then end of October, obviously we want to stop at that point and pay attention to our fourth quarter business and then we pick up again next year. I have really not quantified the total number because there are still works in progress there. It is 100, I've said it is 100 and I believe it is 100 of stores that will have the opportunity, there is -- the analysis is ongoing as we go through more analysis we will get more firm direction the 150 plus number for this year was a new number, for a year probably that may be for next year we will share that as we get little more certainty on locations and where those are going to be.","Dan Binder","Yes, that was really sort of a two-part question. I'm sorry if I confused you. The 300, I was talking about new store openings for Family Dollar. I was just curious what that would look like during the integration period as you consider growth for the Family Dollar format next year and the third year.","Bob Sasser","Well, obviously we pull back until we can get there. There are more productive new store model. And more productive re-merchandize assortment in the store. We don't want to be investing and opening old lot of new stores until we know that we have -- what the model is and that has very success. So near term we pull back as Gary described, we pull back to -- when I say pull back from peak numbers that Family Dollar next will be pull back year also. That I think we got to say that as we get more confidence in the new model, we will ramp it back up, it is there to be done, there is plenty of room for the Family Dollar stores. We are excited about what we can do. We need this time for the rest of this year probably next year in order to get confidence that the new model and we will open stores but it won't be the peak numbers that we've seen in the past but little confidence that the new models are going to perform.","Operator","And now we will conclude today's question-and-answer session.

This morning, we announced our results for our second quarter. Sales increased 4.6% to $5.53 billion. Our consolidated same-store sales increased 1.8%. By segment, our comp sales for Dollar Tree banner increased 3.7% and the Family Dollar banner's comps were flat compared to last year's Q2 increase of 1%. Our enterprise gross margin rate declined 70 basis points to 30.1%; operating income was $382.5 million or 6.9%; and diluted earnings per share increased 17.3% to $1.15, one penny below the high-end of our guidance range.","In mid-July, our Company hit a milestone by opening our 15,000th store. We celebrated the occasion with exciting offers and promotions at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores, along with coordinated grand opening celebrations at select stores across the country. Also, in July, we opened up our 23rd U.S. distribution center located in Warrensburg, Missouri on time and on budget. The 1 million square foot facility is creating approximately 400 jobs in Western Missouri and will initially be serving Dollar Tree stores, but is equipped with the necessary systems to serve both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners in the future. The partnership and support we received from the state of Missouri, the City of Warrensburg and the surrounding communities was just outstanding.","The Dollar Tree sales initiatives have been hitting on all cylinders. Dollar Tree has now delivered 42 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth. In fact, each of the last five quarters, the increases have been greater than 3.5%. The last time Dollar Tree hit a streak of at least five consecutive quarters over 3.5% was in 2012. Our merchandize excitement continues to be driven by great values for a dollar, the discovery of what\u2019s new and our efforts around our major holidays and seasons. The Dollar Tree continues to grow at the business around these important times of the year.","For our Dollar Tree banner in the second quarter, top performing categories were snacks and beverage, candy, health and personal care, toys and household consumables. Sales performance was balanced across discretionary and consumables; comps were positive all three months; May same stores sales was the strongest month in the quarter. However, on a two year stack basis July had the best monthly performance as we had a very strong July in 2017. Geographically, Dollar Tree same store sales growth was strongest in the West, Southwest and Midwest, and all of our zones delivered positive comps greater than 2.5%.","For the Family Dollar banner in the second quarter, while we did not achieve our intended target on comps for the quarter, we continue to focus on the key initiatives that will drive to long-term success. The important elements that will change the sales trajectory for Family Dollar are; investment in customer experience, including better in-stocks and assortment; more private brand offerings along with better buying from our import capabilities; delivering value through our Smart Ways to Save; and specific customer offers that are targeted through our Smart Coupon program; and most of all, around our efforts to renovate the stores with better adjacencies and merchandize impact of our important categories.","Top performing categories in the quarter included beauty care, accessories, electronics and snacks and beverage. Our comp performance in the quarter was driven by consumables, approximately three quarters of our business at Family Dollar is consumable needs base products. And we\u2019ve comped again positively for seven consecutive quarters. For cadence in the quarter comp sales were strongest in May; July was negative, but up against the toughest comparison in the prior year. Geographically, Family Dollar same store sales for the quarter was again strongest in our Northeast and West Zones.","Switching to Canada, highlights for Dollar Tree Canada; our team continues to deliver mid single-digit positive comps for the quarter with increases in both traffic and ticket; the sales growth was balanced as both discretionary and consumables comped better than 5% for the quarter; top performing categories in Canada included books, lawn and garden, candy and greeting cards. For Dollar Tree Direct, while small less than 1% of our sales, but continue to be an important part of our business; it provides us the tool to connect with our customers and hence, loyalty at Dollar Tree and drive brand awareness. In Q2, we saw double-digit increases in both sales and Web site traffic to dollartree.com.","Our efforts here to connect with our customer and organizations help them find easily the solutions they need for bulk purchases and the ability to buy first some of the early seasons' great values. We continue to engage our customers in all forms of social media with a growing base of fans and social interaction that includes greater videos highlighting the Dollar Tree product. Please check both of our Web site, dollartree.com and familydollar.com.","Now, looking at the real estate in the second quarter; we opened a total of 146 new stores, 82 Dollar Trees, 64 Family Dollars; we\u2019ve relocated or expanded 13 stores, 10 Dollar Trees and three Family Dollars; and we renovated 109 Family Dollar stores as part of our renovation initiative. We also re-bannered 17 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores for a total 285 projects during the quarter. We also have freezers and coolers to 125 Dollar Tree stores during the second quarter, bringing our total of Dollar Tree stores with freezers and cooler to 5,436 now. During the quarter, we closed 26 stores, three Dollar Trees and 23 Family Dollars. And we ended the quarter with 15,073 stores split out with 6,812 Dollar Trees, 8,261 Family Dollars.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I just wanted to speak briefly about tariffs and potential for additional tariffs that are in the news. So far, the United States trade representative has implemented tariffs against 50 billion in Chinese goods and is considering implementing 10% or 25% tariffs against an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods. This potential impact could be mitigated by a variety of factors; the U.S. TR may reduce a list of impacted tariff lines before tariffs are implemented; and later may even grant specific product exclusions. We are and will be active in the process, we will not stand still like other shocks to the system, we will do what we have always done to mitigate impact. We can also attempt to negotiate price concessions, change product [sizes] [ph], specifications and evolve products mix. At Family Dollar, we can do all those things and we can also change our price. And as always, we have always taken a look at alternative sources of supply and product outside of China.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and our outlook for Q3 and fiscal 2018. Kevin?","Kevin Wampler","Thanks, Gary and good morning. Total sales for the second quarter grew 4.6% to $5.53 billion within our guidance range of $5.47 billion to $5.57 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 7% to $2.77 billion and Family Dollar segment total sales increased 2.3% to $2.76 billion. Enterprise same store sales increased 1.8% on a constant currency basis or 1.9% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations. On a segment basis, same store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 3.7% or 3.8% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations, and the Family Dollar banner comp was flat compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter.","Overall, gross profit increased 2.2% to $1.66 billion for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin declined 70 basis points to 30.1% versus 30.8% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.5% for the second quarter, a 10 basis point decline compared to the prior year second quarter. The decline was primarily due to 20 basis points of increased shrink costs, partially offset by improved merchandise cost net of fright as sales mix positively impacted margin, offsetting freight headwinds.","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 25.7% during the second quarter compared with 27.2% in the comparable prior year period. 150 basis points decline was primarily due to merchandise costs, including freight, which increased 85 basis points resulting from higher domestic freight costs, partially offset by increased initial mark downs. Distribution costs increased 30 basis points due to higher merchandising and distribution center payroll -related costs. Shrink costs increased 15 basis points and occupancy costs increased 10 basis points, resulting from the deleveraging effect of flat comparable store sales.","Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter increased 30 basis points to 23.2% from 22.9% in the same quarter last year. Excluding the $2.6 million receivable impairment from the prior year's quarter, SG&A as a percent of sales increased 40 basis points from an adjusted 22.8% in the prior year's quarter. The increase was driven by higher store payroll costs, partially offset by lower depreciation and lower store repairs and maintenance costs as a percentage of sales. Second quarter SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales increased to 23.7% compared to 23.4% in the prior year's quarter. The increase was primarily due to our store ROI payroll costs, which increased 40 basis points related to our planned Tax Cuts and Jobs Act savings reinvestment plan.","SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 22.6% compared to 22.4% in the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $2.6 million receivable impairment from the prior year, Family Dollar SG&A as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points from 22.3%. The increase was a result of 55 basis point increase in store ROI payroll expenses that was partially offset by lower repairs and maintenance costs and lower depreciation expense.","Operating income for the enterprise was $382.5 million compared with $419.5 million in the same period last year and operating income margin was 6.9% compared to 7.9% in last year's second quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 40 basis points to 10.8% when compared to the prior quarter. Operating income for the Family Dollar segment was $84.8 million or 3.1% for the quarter. Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $44.8 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense.","Effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.9% compared to 32% in the prior year period. The lower rate is the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the federal tax rate to 21% from 35% in the prior year, as well as an $8.1 million reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, resulting from statute expirations. For the second quarter, the Company had net income of $273.9 million or $1.15 per diluted share compared to reported net income of $233.8 million or $0.98 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.","And looking at the balance sheet, combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $647.3 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Our outstanding debt as of August 4, 2018 was approximately $5 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased to 8.5% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 4.6%. Inventory for selling square foot increased to 3.6%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support to scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end increased 15.6% from the same period last year, and increased 12.9% on a selling square foot basis. At quarter end last year, inventory was down 5.2% in total and 6.3% on the selling square foot basis. The increased levels in the current year represent our continued work to support in-stock levels, as well as early receipts of certain holiday merchandize.","Capital expenditures were $213.4 million in the second quarter versus $161.4 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2018, we\u2019re planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $850 million to $865 million, a slight decrease from our prior 2018 outlook. Depreciation and amortization totaled $152.6 million for the second quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $151.4 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $610 million to $620 million.","Our updated outlook for fiscal 2018 included the following assumptions. Calendar considerations for the year include the following, 2018 is a 52 week year, the 53 week in Q4 of 2017 added $406.6 million to sales and approximately $0.21 to earnings per share. Halloween shifts from Q4 into Q3, this shift favorably impacts Q3 from a revenue and earnings perspective that has no impact to same store sales. We expect continued pressure on the store payroll based on states increasing minimum ways. Wages, additionally as previously discussed, we continue to invest in store hours and average hourly rates as part of our $100 million investment into the business from our projected $250 million tax benefit. We expect higher domestic freight and diesel costs to continue. These costs continue to trend higher than our original guidance and we have reflected this in our outlook. We continue to work to mitigate these increases as we go forward.","The Company, along with other retailers, recently learned of an anti-dumping duty assessed by the U.S. Department of Commerce on certain Chinese driven products. We expect to incur $0.04 per share of expense in our fourth quarter to account for the anti-dumping duty assessment. Net interest expense will be approximately $47 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4. Our guidance does not include any share repurchases and we cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 21.5% for the third quarter and 21.4% for fiscal 2018.","Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be $238.9 million shares for 4Q. For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range $5.53 billion to $5.64 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.11 to $1.18. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.4%. For fiscal 2018, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $22.75 billion and $22.97 billion based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and 3.4% square footage growth. The Company now anticipates net income per diluted share for the full fiscal year 2018 will range between $4.85 and $5.05 and includes the previously mentioned $0.04 per share of antidumping duty, compared to the Company's previously expected range of $4.80 to $5.10.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Kevin. Over the past few weeks, I attended our annual field leadership meetings at both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. It's our opportunity to connect with our field leaders face-to-face, teach and learn, recognize and reward individuals and the teams for superior performance and give service awards. We interact with our merchant leaders on sales driving initiatives, coach field leaders on people development and ensure that we're all lines heading into the important holiday season. We had very productive meetings and I'm pleased with the caliber of businessmen and women, they are leading our field organizations.","Our leaders are energetic, focused and motivated going to this important back half. For Dollar Tree, the banner is up against some great sales in the back half of last year, 5 comp in Q3 and 3.8 in Q4. And let me talk a little bit about the sales driving initiatives in place to successfully cycle these numbers. These include our snack zone. Last quarter, we provide additional details regarding this concept, which we've been testing in Dollar Tree stores for some time. By the end of Q2, we\u2019ve had stacks up and running in more than 500 stores. Store and customer feedback has been terrific and the numbers support this, and we really like the leap for getting in this new category within the store, the concept targets on the go customers with immediate consumption items. Snack zone sales are consistently outperforming the sales lift targeted for them.","A mid single-digit percent of the store sales are coming from the snack zone items. We plan to have the second zone in at least 750 stores by the end of fiscal 2018. We're already in the development stage of snack zone 2.0, which can be rolled out to smaller Dollar Tree stores in 2019 and beyond. Also, this week, we are announcing a new exciting partnership that Dollar Tree as with Hallmark Company with our greeting cards. Over the past three months, we have rolled out Hallmark greeting cards to all of our Dollar Tree stores. The new greeting cards are expressions from hallmark priced at a dollar and the Hartline line of cards from Hallmark priced at dollars for two cards. All the cards are brand-new and designed exclusively for Dollar Tree. These cards are tailored to be relevant to our customer base and our surrounding stores, and celebrate every type of occasion.","I could not be more proud of how hallmark our merchant teams and store teams execute this transition flawlessly across 6,000 plus stores; it brings a lower-class brand into Dollar Tree; we're excited about this new partnership; and encourage you to see our Hallmark cards being promoted on our Web site, in-stores and social media now that's in every Dollar Tree store. Additionally, our merchant teams continue to locate and source terrific buys that bring the thrill of the heart to the consumer; visit our stores now and you'll see that we are stocking for business; we're lining down to summer and back-to-school offerings and already showing the new holidays ahead of us, Halloween, fall, harvest; we are entering the best time of the year for Dollar Tree to show what\u2019s new for the season.","At Family Dollar, we left our field leadership meeting with an emphasis on our store execution and consistency of delivering a Family Dollar brand standard. Our combine efforts to focus on driving a better store experience, along with the tools our store managers and district leaders new to win was the focus of our year long efforts to drive better store level traffic and conversion in store. The merchandize energy look great and our teams are up for the challenge in the back half.","Our field leadership has focused on the elements that we'll win in the marketplace; our investment in our people, our labor to drive sales, understanding sales impact and merchandizing energy within their four walls, shrink control and store growth and renovations. I've talked about our initiatives around Family Dollar; the basics we are correctly focused on, a better customer experience, better in-stocks and store conditions; improved private brands along with the value compared to our national brand counterparts; import merchandize, it allows us to create value but also to bring the excitement to our store categories; focus on the value on completing it; our callout for Smart Ways to Save; we\u2019ve seen our customer respond to our consumables as we\u2019ve had seven consecutive positive comps in this important line of our business.","Dollar Well items throughout the store creates great price impact and speaks to our customer that many times need this assortment to make it to the end of the month with their budget; and renovations and the excitement around renovations speaks to the portfolio optimization when we take a look at our fleet of stores; we have 8,000 stores and we take a look at how we optimize across the fleet; we have our top volume stores that continue to produce a positive comp; we re-bannered stores, where our metric show that we will do better as a Dollar Tree than a Family Dollar; and then as always, we take a look at the middle group of stores and target the renovations where we can drive better performance, both top line and bottom line.","We\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing on the renovations; we have targeted 450 locations this year and we will do more; we\u2019re going to extend that to 500 this year and we can\u2019t do them through back half of our October, November and December; but we will do 500 this year and are working on setting a higher target for 2019 renovations; our customers are buying more and the feedback gives us great confidence to move forward more of these in the right stores; I believe the right combination of more renovations, along with the foundational elements of our strategy, would drive the traffic and basket that we\u2019re looking for; and really to make meaningful changes to our fleet of 8,000 stores.","We continue to focus on making meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both banners. I feel that we are well positioned to the most attractive sector of the retail to deliver to continued growth and increase value for our long-term shareholders. The combination of more than 15,000 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers in all types of markets. This combination of two great brands provides great flexibility in managing our future growth. Our teams are ready for an important holiday season and are focused to win in their stores and markets as we enter the back half.","Operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC.","Scot Ciccarelli","Gary, you talked about the need to improve consistency at Family Dollar in terms of store appearance, organization, et cetera and that would certainly conform to what we've seen in our stores tours. Do you think you've had the full buy-in from your Family Dollar employee base for all the changes that you're trying to implement? And if not, how do you get that full buy-in from the associate base given the importance of their contribution to what should be improved financial performance?","Gary Philbin","Scot, I think you\u2019re spot on. At the end of the day, we do those absolutely a store at a time and it really speaks to I think two things. I would tell you our leadership, zone, region, district and our store managers that we recognize the ones with superior performance at our field meeting, they are on board. I think the consistency that I'm speaking to is how do we give them the tools to win in their box. And I would tell you it comes down to a few things that have always been part of our elements to focus on, is getting people trained correctly. And that still remains the number one priority in what we've invested in with our tax investment today. Our store manager turnover, while stubborn, has come down a few points and that's against the backdrop of even a robust economy out there. And if we were to say there is one element that combines great store performance match it up with the store manager that has taken the saddle over a year and it's actually remarkable for both banners our performance improves, so we\u2019re focused on that.","When we have store managers leave us before one year, we put our folks in that spot that tends to show up in stores and that lack of consistency. And so that's where we tend to see the cracks in the dam and so we work real hard, trying to understand why people leave us before a year, both at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. But the path is really the same for both, hire the right folks, get them trained, work through their hurdles. But the other piece and you touched on what is renovations too, which then I think gives us a chance to jumpstart and change that by store and district and region very quickly. And that give us the chance to go in and spend time with a greater touch in their stores to gain the consistency and the element that drive traffic and business into those stores. So our focus on investing in our store managers is where we clearly have our eye set. It was the theme of our meeting this year and it's where we expect to see progress over the next year.","Scot Ciccarelli","And can you just remind us when you start to raise wages for the group?","Gary Philbin","Well, the investment if we teed up this year. So keep in mind, we're always monitoring where we are by market and that goes back to even last year. I think we went to this year with a thought we went down when I get behind the curve with unemployment now at 4% people have opportunities. So it's really occasion in specific markets that are tied to investments in our hourly workforce. And so we kicked that off this year in both banners and putting a little bit of science behind it with where are the markets that have the highest increases going on, or can we affect turnover in a better way, because we give a higher starting wage to the folks that got to run the stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Just on the renovations at Family Dollar. Obviously, it has and continues to be a big focus for that banner. I know you haven\u2019t really quantified in the past. But can you maybe just directionally give us a little bit of sense from what you guys are seeing close to renovation? How those stores are performing? Are there may be fewer markdowns at some of those stores if you look from more of the margin that'd be helpful?","Gary Philbin","Because we\u2019ve excited about the renovations and I maybe just want to go back to why I said in comments. I think we\u2019ve taken a hard look across all of our 8,000 stores; and we got a group of stores chugging along, giving us a positive comp; it tend to be our highest volume stores by nature, our customers have been doing business in there and continue to; we\u2019ve re-bannered some that are in between, but the stores in the middle that we can affect to drive comps in; we have an old fleet of stores and we\u2019ve targeted some of the oldest in the fleet to go after that. But more than that, I think what we\u2019re seeing with the renovations is increased traffic and basket; the merchandizing layout is different enough in the store to give the customers to come in and really take a look at some everyday needs, we expand frozen food for instance; but we\u2019ve also enhanced what we\u2019ve done on our seasons at Family Dollar, different than Dollar Tree; summer time becomes much more of a grilling holiday at Family Dollar than it could ever be at Dollar Tree.","We have our impulse items both in our [wow] [ph] tables and up in the frontend, and so we\u2019re seeing really a remarkable pickup for that last dollar our customer might have on something that wasn\u2019t on their shopping list. And so, we\u2019ve had mid single-digit comps in this growing fleet of stores. But as I sit back and take a look at this portfolio of stores, we just got to do more of them to affect change and that\u2019s really going to be our focus for the balance of the year. We\u2019re going to squeeze in another 50 and I\u2019ll do more if we can, we\u2019ll be limited a bit by just the holiday. We don\u2019t -- try not to do too much in our stores after October but we\u2019ll get to 500 maybe more. And then we have the confidence now with what we\u2019ve learned to tweak it a bit and go into 2019 with a bigger number on that group of stores and that\u2019s going to be how we end up this year and the basis for kicking off 2019.","Vincent Sinisi","And then maybe just as the follow up, I'll stay on the same basic subject. Do you guys think that when you\u2019re making enhancements, I mean, core Dollar Tree is obviously the consistent machine. But when you\u2019re making enhancements, either to that or particularly Family Dollar more, do you think in terms of what you\u2019re doing from an advertising perspective, I guess, the heart of the question is, do customers realize as quickly as they can of the enhancements that you folks are making, or do you think maybe there's even more that you could do from that perspective as opposed to just maybe next time they happen to be passing the store? Thoughts around that would be great.","Gary Philbin","Good question and unless you do something, your consumers never realize what you've done. So for Dollar Tree, at the snack zones now, we get a band around at one of the stores, it's on the website. It's word-of-mouth. I would tell you I see people in the isle actually face timing their family members at home because they found something that, in particular, was there. So we've never -- advertising a Dollar Tree is maybe like unlike any other retailer. We want to show people that we have something new but get a banner out in front our folks find us. Family Dollar, fair question, I think it's store-by-store. And so depending on the store in a market, we obviously do everything on the store level side to show customers either that\u2019s [pendants] [ph], banners, big grand openings. And then if the store is worthy in terms of what we think it can drive in sales [it probably get to][ph] zone add to do exactly what you described, tell people what's new, this is why you ought to come. So we gauge that based on the upside opportunity and what we see as a potential and the marketplace that the store is in.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","So I guess at family dollar we think higher levels, the flat comps for the quarter, same store sales turned back negative in July. I guess when you break down the component, is it traffic that\u2019s the missing ingredient here? And do you foresee any need to take pricing actions to accelerate footsteps. I guess just how best to think about the potential game plan and any change that you\u2019re considering?","Gary Philbin","Well, it is traffic that -- during the quarter we actually had a pretty nice basket increase that offset that but we will obviously -- we got to do both. And so the focus on driving traffic and it comes down to some of the things we've mentioned right, consistency of stores. But when you come back to how we take a look at the group of 8,000 stores across the portfolio Matt, the stores that do fine we want to make sure that are amped up on the right store investments that we've talked about on labor. For our customer -- for the stores in the middle, we want to make sure that we have targeted operational plans to make sure we get them up to brand standards as always. We can do things specifically to store level.","Your comment on where we are on pricing, I would tell you our pricing shows us in the targeted area as we want to be against our major competitors, it doesn't mean every once in a while you got to go and find the right thing for a Family Dollar customer around first of month and end of the month to drive that traffic. Those are the arrows in our quiver that we can use on a monthly basis. Over the long range, I want to affect more stores to have customers come in the door, because they know they have that renovated store the right way. So our top line stores to me, I think about as an investment and the things we've talked about, investment in store labor, investment in wages in the middle they'll get some of that. But clearly we get more renovation lift from some of those stores. And as always, we'll take a look at the portfolio optimization and figure out what stores as they come up for lease shouldn\u2019t be part of their hurt anymore. But that will be the process that we think about driving traffic in the back half and impacting 2019.","Matthew Boss","And then just one follow-up. What\u2019s the embedded gross margin outlook in the full year guide? I guess maybe even just higher level, how best to think about the headwinds versus the tailwinds that you're facing in the back half, maybe at both banners?","Kevin Wampler","I think Matt as we think about it and we\u2019ve been pretty transparent about the freight headwinds for since we gave initial guidance way back in early March, that will continue. I think as you look at it, it has a little bit heavier effect in Q4 than Q3 and that\u2019s just really because of the way that goods flow. You basically bringing in a lot of inventory now that you sell in Q4, which is when we capitalize freight it goes with it basically, so you\u2019ll have some of that. So we know that\u2019s going to be there. Obviously, I do believe these will become a little bit less of a headwind as we go through the year assuming the price stays steady where it is today.","If you look at diesel a year ago for Q2 is about 2.50, it went to about 2.70 for Q3 and about 2.95 for Q4, so diesel does trend up as you go to the back half of the last year. So to compare while still be a headwind will not be as big of a headwind as we get to the fourth quarter assuming current rates stay somewhat steady. And its right around 3.25 right now is where the diesel rate is. So that\u2019s the big one realistically that we\u2019ve seen. Shrink again is been a headwind, again it dissipates a little bit as we go to the back half, but it will still be a headwind as well. Now the good thing is as we talked about on the Dollar Tree side, the mix has been very good. We've had a very balanced sell on consumables and discretionary. And when we see that, we tend to like that on our overall margin and we\u2019re able to get those nice comp sales in our discretionary category, so a lot of puts and takes. On the comp basis as we saw this quarter, we don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not able to leverage our Family Dollar overall occupancy cost, we are able to leverage the Dollar Tree. So some puts and takes for each banner but again, they\u2019ll continue to be some pressure as we go through the back half. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse.","Judah Frommer","So first maybe given the differences in the Dollar Tree and the Family Dollar banner in terms of how they\u2019re shopped in the core customers there. Can you help us out with what you\u2019re seeing from, I would say, the middle and the low income consumer clearly very good traffic at mass merchants, and Dollar Tree probably benefited a bit from that. But any insights into maybe that lower end consumer would be great?","Gary Philbin","I would say Dollar Tree and because of the geography and where the stores sites are, you\u2019ve heard other retailers call down, I think Dollar Tree feeds off that. Our customers are coming in I think with a little more to spend, basically middle class and above and the opportunity is there to spend a little bit more and we\u2019re seeing that both in traffic and basket at Dollar Tree. And it just make sense when we take a look at the anchors we're next to and we hear them report and we compare that to how we\u2019re doing it with the same anchors and a pretty good correlation there, so it feels pretty good to us. I think with the Family Dollar customer, we do serve a needs-based customer. It is different. I think always as we've talked about, we're there to try to provide a solution for a budget from beginning of the month to the end of the month, much more consumable driven, which is showing up in the consumable comp we have. I think the stubborn part for us there has been discretionary.","And in May, we were really encouraged; obviously spring, early summer got to late start, because of weather in Q1 that everyone has talked about; May we really saw a pop up and I think it was a couple of things; I think clearly, people were probably behind on warm weather purchases at that point; but I think it also spoke to at Family Dollar, because sales were delayed and every stores have their best assortment right there at the beginning of May; and the comps we saw at that point across discretionary, I think point to I think when all gets in the store and looks as good as we hope or close to it, our customer response. I think as we went through the summer as assortments breakdown or we went out something here or there on our assortments, especially on the discretionary that\u2019s what we lose steam and I think that's all on us. But that's something we can fix, that\u2019s something we can control.","But I think this lower income customer listen; we\u2019re very sensitive to it; utility bills have been higher this summer, because of all the heat across the country and rents; if you take a look at any trend that I do, it still shows rents continue to go up three years going now, so that's money in their pocket; so we can do better to get those dollars and appeal to them to buy across our entire store that's our focus; but I want us always to be sensitive to making sure we have opening price point for this customer when they come in our store; when they have to spend extra 20 bucks on a utility bill; we ought to be there to find the solution to make that somehow -- the burden of them of stretching out their budget for the back half of the month.","Judah Frommer","And maybe just a quick follow-up, I know we\u2019re not talking about synergies much anymore, but as you talk about shipping for both banners out of your new DC. Is there supply chain opportunity we can think about as we continue in the integration there? Or is it going to be coming on new DCs or maybe active than historical once?","Kevin Wampler","I think we've pretty much said from day one that supply chain was a little longer term project as we think about it from rightsizing, rationalizing, getting everything in the right place at the end of the day. And again as you can see the new building in Warrensburg, Missouri has been built such that today it's servicing Dollar Tree stores where it can be co-bannered and service both. Again, from a stem mile perspective is always going to be beneficial. I think there's things we continue to look at in supply chain, automation is one of those and how you use automation to bring your overall -- where we really look at is cost per case, how much is it costing us to move a case through the distribution network at the end of the day. So there is opportunities, things that we\u2019re working on and looking at and really should have an opportunity to continue to move forward with some of those as we go forward. It'll be some capital investment to do some of these things, but I think the return on that would we believe will make it worthwhile.","Gary Philbin","And I would just add also capacity issues really been on the Dollar Tree side as we re-bannered stores, converted deal stores to Dollar Tree. We just needed the firepower on the Dollar Tree side, so that's the other reason that Warrensburg will serve as Dollar Tree initially.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joseph Feldman with Telsey Group.","Joseph Feldman","I wanted to follow up on with you guys on something regarding the tariffs. I know these are -- we haven't seen them all implemented yet and there is another $200 billion talked about and the 10% or 25%. But $0.04 for ribbon alone seems like a lot to me. Could you give a little more color around that? And what it would look like potentially if at least the current list that's being proposed was implemented?","Kevin Wampler","Joseph, just to be clear, I think there is a difference here. What we talked about is the anti-dumping duty, which was a specific ruling by the Commerce Department against ribbon from China. They had a dumping duty of 380%, that's 380% and is rolled up on August the 3rd or 8th somewhere in that timeline, while orders for the holidays had already been written six months before and implied in on both on trucks. That's completely different than the tariff fees, which is being considered at 10% or 25%. So it's all mixed up that to the dumping duty at a one company issue on Chinese ribbon that's what the effect is on the $0.04 based on that 380%, different than the tariff 3.01 that's been considered at 10% and 25%. Make sense?","Joseph Feldman","Yes, that's very helpful, thanks for clarifying that. And then a quick follow-up, I know, I fully understand the vast number of stores that you guys are operating with Family Dollar, and you are accelerating some of the Family Dollar renovations. But how do you accelerate it further like -- how you get to 10,000 stores in a year, 2,000 stores even in a year. it seems as that's one of the gating factors. Is it just a human capital issue or is it -- are there other things that you could streamline to speed that up?","Gary Philbin","I think you\u2019re exactly right. I mean, the optimization of this group of stores, we can impact more stores in the 500 this year and everything suggest that we're going through a budget season, now what they're going to take us to do more and how many more is that. We\u2019re not lacking capital we certainly want great return for any dollar we want be prudent managers of capital. But this is what we got to do to change the impact for the fleet of stores. And so if anything, we'll overcome all of it, we'll figure out the right stores, we'll figure out how many people we need to put against it. Obviously, it's not the only limiting thing you got to consider but you certainly have to plain it. But I think you're spot on, how do we do more that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to change what we -- how we affect our fleet of stores and really how we affect our customers at the end of the day to buy more and have more of them come into the store.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert Ohmes","Actually my question is on the Family Dollar gross margin, and if you could give us more color on how to think about that for the rest of the year, down 150 for this quarter and you -- it looked like merchandise cost pressures in freight was the biggest driver of that. Should we be assuming that type of rate decline for the back half? And then also just looking out over the next couple years, could you remind us how you're thinking about the gross margin at Family Dollar? Thanks.","Kevin Wampler","Rob, as we look to the back half as I stated earlier, there will continue to be pressure and freight is the biggest pressure item less in Q3 than in Q4 and again that\u2019s timing of inventory coming into the system and when it's sold. But the belief is that the effect will be somewhat less than it was in Q2 as we sit here today, so that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. But there will continue to be pressure and really the freight is the biggest impact. We were -- in Q2, we actually saw our mark up was up, we did have a fairly significant shift to consumables in the mix about 60 basis points more in consumable sales in a year ago. So overall, we feel pretty good about how we navigated through that. But again, our needs space customers are liking what they are seeing from a consumable standpoint.","And as far as long-term, obviously, as we've said this, the freight item this year is one of those shop to the system type items that we have to deal with and manage through and we'll do that. Obviously, the expectation is that we\u2019re going to drive the gross profit up as we go forward, that's the way we view it. Obviously, there is a lot of things that have to happen and we can definitely do better and shrink. We're not happy with our shirk performance this year in either banner, so there is an opportunity there. I think from the standpoint of distribution costs. Again, as I mentioned on the earlier question there is opportunity there. So there is going to be opportunities, it's just putting that together. And at the end of the day, to Gary's point, driving renovations, driving sales, creating leverage online items would be helpful as well. So I think that's the general thought process.","Gary Philbin","Rob, I'd just add color. I know you asked about long term and we're going through a year here where the shrink bogeyman is in the room with us, we\u2019re going to get that one look. Freight is a real thing this year but it's not going to be forever, and we\u2019re going to find a way to mitigate it until it does get better with the external forces at work. So I feel the pain right now it's not going to be a forever thing. In our discretionary business at Family Dollar is going to be the way that -- one of the ways we expand margin. As we do with renovations that drives margin expansion in the stores but we still have to get better on that side of the business, it\u2019s fair to be head for us and the levers that we\u2019ve talked about on private brands and import are just as true now as when we started it out, and that\u2019s what our teams are working on.","Robert Ohmes","And one just follow-up question. In the second quarter if you look at the largest U.S. retailers, like Wal-Mart, Target, Costco, some of them put up some of the best traffic comps in a long time. I would love to just get your perspective on where both of your banners fit into an environment like we saw in the second quarter where the traffic really just accelerated, for example, at Wal-Mart?","Gary Philbin","Well, I would say, we like healthy customer. I mean, we\u2019re in the same arena, especially at Dollar Tree. And I think our two year stacks at Dollar Tree, we\u2019re pretty proud of. So I think that speaks to everything that they\u2019ve been talking about what they see and health of the customer. And I think even at Family Dollar as we\u2019ve started off the quarter, we certainly had thought that if we were going to extend what we saw early on we\u2019d be having a different conversation now. We serve a different customer at Family Dollar we serve a little bit of everyone. And I go back to a customer that is on a different budget than most of us can think about and we get great at every first month and we have items that she need then. And at the end of the month, do we have the items opening price point often times that allows her to get towards the end of the month.","It\u2019s not the same rising tide for the customer at Family Dollar and we owe it to ourselves and really to our customers there to make sure what we put in front of them will resonate with them. It's showing up on the consumable side, we like our business there. I mean, we\u2019re gaining greater pray you all there and we\u2019re working real hard on the discretionary things that it -- one more purchase that we needed at Family Dollar store to make all the difference in the world. And then do that against the backdrop of consistency, merchandising energy in the store that\u2019s push the headcount that on renovations for the balance of this year and next, and I think that\u2019s the magic sauce we need at Family Dollar.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Gary, I think probably on every conference call during the last couple of years and probably most of your Investor meetings see the question about pricing for Family Dollar has come up again earlier on this call. And the Company always communicates that pricing is better than it was a few years ago. We have smart ways to say better in caps, et cetera. But is there a philosophical reason why Family Dollar doesn\u2019t adopt a pricing strategy of let's say being equal to maybe no more than 3% above Wal-Mart on national branded consumable items?","Gary Philbin","Well, philosophically Dan, I think we take a look at the major of competitors as we go against in the consumer market. I mean, obviously, when we\u2019re close in the trade area of Wal-Mart, they become one of them they're not in every market we have. So we take a look and either weight on specific items or match, or something that isn\u2019t important to our Family Dollar customer based on how we see sales flow through the store, we make judgments. Clearly, what comes through loud and clear from every research we've ever done and we continue to see is opening price point at Family Dollar. And sometimes it's a dollar item, but not all of the time. And those are the items that we really got to be right on with our customer. And so those are the elements that when we take a look at the baskets that our customer buys, and I still go back to consumables.","We have a large number of KBIs like everyone else and what we see in our consumables business is driving that comp now for second consecutive quarters. So I\u2019m not going to put together the pieces of all our pricing strategy on this call today, but I think those are the elements that allow us to drive that comp on the consumable side. And I would add maybe one other piece for our customer. You've heard me talk about two at every conference. What we do at first the month and end of the month at Family Dollar are two different things and that's important to for our customer. How we merchandise, what's in that, how we affect them with the Smart Coupons, which continues to grow. And I think it's not something we've talked a lot about, but we're really surprised by how many customers have signed up; one, because our customers have just as many smartphones as the average in the U.S.; and number two, they see the items offered to them that make the most sense. And we've heard me give the examples before and at conferences.","So it\u2019s not just what's on the shelf, it's that plus what's in the ad promoted, it\u2019s our price drop, it's the dollar wow our customers sees that go through the store with. So I view it as a recipe we go to market with, never taking a look at one item, but making sure that our pricing strategy is spot on with how we want to affect our customer base.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Randy Guiler for closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Thank you for joining us for today's call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Guiler","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the third fiscal quarter of 2018. Participating on today's call will be our President and CEO, Gary Philbin; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, 8-K, 10-Q and Annual Report, which are on file with the SEC.

Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up, if necessary.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Philbin, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer.","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Randy, and good morning everyone. Today, we are going to discuss our third quarter performance as well as our plans to improve the consistency of execution across the Family Dollar store base and to optimize our real estate portfolio. This will include a meaningful acceleration of in store renovations and re-banners in 2019.","This morning we announced results for the third quarter. Sales increased 4.2% to 5.54 billion. Consolidated same store sales increased 1%. By segment, comp sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.3%, the Family Dollar banner comps were down 40 bps compared to last year's Q3 increased of 1.5 on a two-year stack basis comps accelerated slightly. Our enterprise gross margin rate declined 110 basis points to 30.2. Operating income was 387.8 million or 7% and diluted earnings per share increased 16.8% to a $1.18 at the high-end of our guidance range.","We delivered earnings within the range of our expectations despite continued cost pressures related to domestic freight and our investment in store wages. Dollar Tree delivered its 43rd consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth with increases in both customer transactions and average ticket. We are pleased with the performance of our newly renovated Family Dollar stores. Additionally, we have begun the important phase of consolidating our store support centers into our Chesapeake campus, which will improve our ability to support Family Dollar stores through enhanced collaboration, communication and teamwork.","Dollar Tree continues to have a most unique, differentiated and defensible business model in U.S. value retail. Customers love our dollar fixed price point as demonstrated by 43 consecutive quarters of positive comps. Despite periodic cost challenges the Company has continued to deliver a relatively consistent gross margin annually with sector leading operating margin. Our 2.3 comp this quarter was on top of a 5.0 comp in last year's third quarter, and the comp growth was driven by balanced increases in both transaction count and average tickets.","In our Dollar Tree banner for the third quarter, top performing categories were snacks and beverage, candy, stationary, greeting cards and our Halloween seasonal assortment. We are extremely pleased with the recent addition of the Hallmark brand to our product assortment at Dollar Tree, customers are thrilled with the values and the offering, and I'll touch more on that in a moment.","Sales performance was driven by strength in discretionary categories. Comps were positive and exceeded 1.5% in all three months. October same-store sales were the strongest months in the quarter, and we saw a terrific sell-through on our Halloween seasonal merchandise. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the West, Southwest, Southeast, and all of our operating zones delivered positive comps.","On last quarter's call, I briefly touch on our beginning of our new partnership with Hallmark. We introduce the new Hallmark greeting card program in June. Every Dollar Tree store in the fleet was re-fixtured and merchandised with a fantastic new assortment. The rollout across the chain was completed one week ahead of schedule and our customer acceptance and feedback has been terrific and was validated by a double-digit comp in our third quarter.","We are able to enhance the assortment by market and store. We have cards tailored for African-American shoppers or Hispanic shoppers, religious, inspirational card occasions. We have fantastic every day and seasonal assortments with our Heartline brand and our best products of two for a dollar and our Expressions brand for a dollar per card, all are branded with the Signature Hallmark brand and recognizable crown logo. We are enthusiastic about this new partnership with Hallmark and it adds to our very important party category.","Also during the quarter, we added new snack zones into an additional 300 stores. We now have snack zones up and running in more than 800 stores. Store and customer feedback has been terrific and our numbers support this as we like the lift not just from the category, but within the store. The concept targets on the go customers with immediate consumption items and our snack zone sales are consistently outperforming the budgets assigned to them. These are just two examples of how Dollar Tree continues to reinvent our assortment to drive excitement in our stores.","For the Family Dollar banner in the third quarter, since acquiring our Family Dollar brand, our team has made progress towards addressing needed investments, but there's more to be done. While comps for the quarter across the banner as a whole did not meet our targets our renovated stores continue to perform ahead of our expectations. In fact, in the third quarter, we are seeing that the performance of our newly renovated stores, are the best performing of our renovation waves over the past six quarters. These strong results give us the confidence that we're poised to see the benefits of our investments in the brand, and we continue to focus on the key initiatives that will drive to long-term success.","The foundational elements that we have shared from the beginning are investment in customer experience, being better in stocks and assortment, more private brand offerings along with better buying from our import capability, delivering value to our customers through our smart ways to save, specific customer offers through our smart coupon program, and now most importantly around our efforts to renovate the stores with better adjacencies and impact of our important categories. I will provide more detail on these efforts later in this call.","Top performing categories during the quarter includes snacks and beverage, refrigerated, frozen products, candy, beauty care and laundry care. We delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps in the Family Dollar consumables business. Sales cadence comps were slightly negative in August and September, and slightly positive in October. In the prior year all three months were greater than 1% positive comp. Geographically, Family Dollar same store sales growth for quarter was once again strongest in our West, Mountain West and mid-Atlantic zones.","Switching to Dollar Tree Canada the team again delivered mid single-digit positive comps for the quarter, with increases in both ticket and traffic. The sales growth was balanced as both discretionary and consumables comped at or better than 4% for the quarter. Top performing categories include harvest, apparel, greeting cards. Importantly, the team Canada achieved this operating income for the quarter.","The digital division of Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Direct had another productive and profitable quarter in Q3. We experienced comp sales growth in our e-commerce sales where we are increasingly profitable. As we continue to over time leverage the existing infrastructure to drive to the bottom line. Online, we launched a robust marketing campaign to promote Hallmark cards in the stores. The campaign include a landing page deck, a dedicated Hallmark video and craft ideas featuring our cards.","Now looking at real estate in the third quarter we opened a total of a 127 new stores, 87 Dollar Trees and 40 Family Dollars. We relocated or expanded 14 stores - 10 Dollar Trees and 4 Family Dollars. We renovated 164 Family Dollar stores as part of our renovation initiative. We re-bannered 30 former Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 335 projects during the quarter. We have completed 488 Family Dollar renovations in fiscal 2018 exceeding our original target of 450 for the year. We also added freezers and coolers into a 143 Dollar Tree stores during the third quarter, bringing our total of Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 5579.","During the quarter, we closed 18 stores, 6 Dollars Trees and 12 Family Dollars, and we ended the quarter with 15,187 stores, broken-out 6,923 Dollar Trees and 8,264 Family Dollars. For the full year, we expect to have 325 new Dollar Tree stores and approximately 230 Family Dollar stores. This is below our original plan of 350 Dollar Trees and 300 Family Dollars. The shortfall is due to timing on the Dollar Tree side, and our accelerated focus to renovations on the Family Dollar side. We have mentioned previously our effort to switch to do more renovations at Family Dollar, and by our fiscal year end that number will be at 500.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I like to provide an update on the Section 301 tariffs and the potential for additional tariffs. Today, we currently source our product for more than two dozen countries, which does afford us a degree of flexibility. And I'm extremely proud of the work our merchandising teams, which have been very active working with our supplier base to minimize our impact from tariffs. Because of our team's effort, the expected impact on tariffs to fiscal 2018 will be minimal, as we've always said with visibility and due cost with some amount of time, we're typically able to navigate and manage the business for ways to offset these costs.","Our options include negotiating price concessions from vendors, changing product sizes, specifications and evolving our product mix. In Family Dollar, we can raise retails but only as a last resort, assuming a 10% Section 301 tariffs or freight will increase due to 25% next year. Dollar Tree has already mitigated the potential impact of the 2019 tariffs by 80% and Family Dollar by 50%. We have made significant process and will provide additional updates on our fourth quarter call.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail in our third quarter performance and for our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018. Kevin?","Kevin Wampler","Thank you, Gary, and good morning. Total sales for the third quarter grew 4.2% to $5.54 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 6.3% to $2.85 billion within the Dollar segment total sales increased 2% to 2.69 billion. Enterprise same-store sales increased 1%, on a segment basis same-store for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.3% or 2.2% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations and the Family Dollar banner decreased by 40 basis points.","Overall our gross profit increased by $5.9 million or 0.4% to $1.67 billion for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year's quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin declined 110 basis points to 30.2% versus 31.3% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.8% for the third quarter a 30 basis point decline compared with the prior year's third quarter. The decline was primarily due to the higher costs related to the distribution center payroll and shrink. Increases in freight were offset by improved mark on and a positive margin effect from mix shift based on strong discretionary sales for the quarter.","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 25.3% during the third quarter, which compared to 27.5% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to merchandise costs including freight, which increased 60 basis points resulting from higher domestic freight cost. 11 basis points of that increase related to hurricane-related costs incurred due to our Marianna Florida DC being down due to the loss of power and storm clean up. Stores normally serviced by those DC were moved to other DCs in the network for approximately three weeks increasing stem miles and cost.","Markdown increased 50 basis points related to promotional markdowns, approximately 10 basis points of the increase was due to damaged inventory in our Marianna DC in multiple Florida-based stores. Shrink cost increased 40 basis points due to unfavorable inventory results and changes in the accrual rate. Distribution cost increased 40 basis points due to higher distribution center payroll-related costs and a change to allocate certain benefit costs related to the DC to be consistent across banners. This represented 25 basis points of the increase. Occupancy cost increased 30 basis points resulting from the deleveraging effect of the decline in the same-store sales.","Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter improved 10 basis points to 23.2% from 23.3% in the same quarter last year, the increase was driven by lower corporate and operating expenses and lower depreciation as a percentage of sales partially offset by higher payroll costs. In addition, the third quarter includes $2.3 million of expense related to the store support center consolidation announced September 18, 2018.","Third quarter SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales improved to 23.2% compared to 23.3% in the prior year's quarter. The improvement was primarily due to leverage from the increase in same-store sales and lower incentive compensation costs, partially offset by 20 basis point increase in store hourly payroll expense resulting from the planned tax reinvestment. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 23.2% compared to 23.4% in the prior year's quarter. The 20 point basis point improvement was a result of operating and corporate expenses decreasing approximately 40 basis points resulting from lower advertising expense, legal fees and a gain on sale of fixed assets.","Depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 20 basis points as a result of certain assets that were revalued upon the 2015 acquisition becoming fully depreciated or amortized. Payroll expense increased approximately 35 basis points, primarily due to increased store hourly payroll as a result of the planned reinvestment of income tax savings and higher healthcare claims, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses.","Operating income for the enterprise was $387.8 million compared with $425.2 million in the same period last year and operating income margin was 7% compared to 8% in last year's third quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 20 basis points to 11.6% when compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income for Family Dollar segment was $55.9 million or 2.1% for the quarter. Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $47.8 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.1% compared to 32.4% in the prior year period. The lower rate is the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the federal tax rate to 21% from 35% in the prior year. Additionally, the Company recorded a tax benefit of 15.7 million based on the substantial completion of its analysis on the net deferred tax liability valuation. For the third quarter, the Company had net income of $281.1 million or $1.18 per diluted share compared to reported net income of $239.9 million or $1.01 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.","Looking at the balance sheet, combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $708.3 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Our outstanding debt as of November 3, 2018 was approximately $5 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased to 12% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 4.7%. Inventory for selling square foot increased to 6.9%. The increase reflects the acceleration of receipts of certain import goods to minimize the impact of increased tariffs.","We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end increased 7.1% from the same period last year, and increased 5.4% on a selling square foot basis. The increased levels in the current year primarily represent our continued work to support in-stock levels at a modest increase in the average unit retail.","Capital expenditures were $228.4 million in the third quarter versus $177.7 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2018, we expect consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $825 million. Depreciation and amortization totaled $150.5 million for the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $149.4 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2018, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $610 million.","Our updated outlook for fiscal 2018 includes the following assumptions. Calendar considerations include the following 2018 is a 52 week year, 2017 was a 53 week year and the 53rd week in Q4 of 2017 added $406.6 million to sales and approximately $0.21 to earnings per share. We reduced our sales outlook in Q4 due to opening 30 less Dollar Tree stores and 70 less Family Dollar stores as originally planned as noted earlier by Gary.","Our updated guidance now includes approximately 6 million for expected cost in Q4 related to our store support center consolidation. We expect continued pressure on the store payroll based on competitive markets and states increasing minimum wage. Additionally, as previously discussed, we continue to invest in store hours and average hourly wage rates as part of our $100 million investment into our business from our projected $250 million tax benefit.","We expect higher domestic freight and diesel costs to continue. That interest expense will be approximately 47 million in Q4. Our guidance does not include expenses and charges in connection with the effects in store optimization including store renovations, store closures, and other assets. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance assumes the tax rate of 21.75% for the fourth quarter and 20.2% for fiscal 2018.","Weighted average diluted share count assumed to be 239.3 million shares for Q4 and 238.9 million shares for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $6.1 billion to $6.21 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.86 to $1.95. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.2%.","For fiscal 2018, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $22.72 billion and $22.83 billion, based on a low single-digit same store sales increase and 3.2% square footage growth. The Company now anticipates net income per diluted share for full year fiscal 2018 will range between $4.86 to $4.95 compared to the Company's previously expected range of $4.85 to $5.05.","I'll now turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Philbin","Thanks, Kevin. Following the completion of the acquisition of Family Dollar in July 2015, we have made significant progress on the integration. We have exceeded our initial synergy targets, strengthened our balance sheet, and at the same time laying the groundwork for our future growth. As part of the integration process, we focused first on building a single infrastructure by implementing initiatives to establish a single foundation to drive performance across the organization and support the growth of both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands. As part of this foundational work, we successfully implemented a shared services model across corporate support functions.","We introduced a common systems and processes across both brands. We improved logistic and supply chain efficiencies, including testing and refining the approach in systems for combined distribution centers. Our first combined distribution center is in St. George, Utah, where we began servicing both brands in 2016, our learnings from this center are paving the way for the launch of our next generation combined DCs and additional synergies. And we commenced the consolidation of corporate functions, including all support functions into our Chesapeake, Virginia headquarters location. We expect to complete the consolidation by fall 2019.","With this foundation in place, Family Dollar's position along with the Dollar Tree brand to benefit from the combined scale of our broad footprint. Our integration work has not only been focused on the corporate level. During this time, we've implemented initiatives to improve operational performance across the footprint of Family Dollar stores. Examples of our work building the leadership team by hiring executives with significant and relevant retail experience, changing restock policies to improve in stocks.","Improving adjacencies and merchandising of key impact categories of the focus on consumables and increased refrigeration, introducing programs and training to enhance the sales culture, including store level compensation programs to better incentivize and align performance, launching smart ways to save our customer facing marketing program, investing in mobile technology and introducing smart coupons to better reach core customers and increase store loyalty.","Commencing a program to improve and rebrand private label products and increase the variety and quantity of private label products in store. Completing a store format test to optimize layout and develop a new prototype design. As we've discussed in prior calls. We've analytically looked at our process to optimize Family Dollar real estate portfolio through renovating stores, re-bannering stores to Dollar Tree brand, or closing stores. Since completing the Family Dollar transaction, we have opened 830 new Family Dollar stores renovated 865 Family Dollars, re-bannered 354 stores from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree and closed 195 Family Dollars stores.","Our renovation program really began 18 months ago and since then, we continue to take the learnings from each generation of renovations and applied them to the next. You've heard us say our renovations, are comping the mid-to-high single digits that's true when you look at the entire footprint of renovated Family Dollar's, however if you look at the more recent renovations we're seeing higher comps which gives us the confidence were executing well.","We therefore going to begin accelerating our store optimization program in 2019, as of now, we expect to renovate a minimum of 1000 Family Dollar stores in fiscal 2019. Next year we plan to open 350 new Dollar Tree stores and 200 new Family Dollar stores, as well as re-bannering additional 200 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree. Additionally in '19, we will be expanding snacks zones to additional Dollar Tree stores and we expect to be in a position to provide you with additional information on the store related projects in 2019.","So in summary, through the hard work we've done in the past 3.5 years, we've put in place the foundational elements that we need to be successful over the long-term, and with the acceleration of our program to optimize our fleet of stores under the Family Dollar brand, we are going to improve the customer experience across our portfolio and accelerate our growth. We've done a lot of testing and we know what works in both urban and rural markets, and based on that, we think, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us and across the country. In short, we are more excited about our future than ever.","Let me give a brief update on our capital allocation plans in connection with the acquisitions, we did not make share repurchases in order to allocate sufficient capital to reduce outstanding debt. Invest to support the growth of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, invest in the initiatives to integrate Family Dollar and to improve store performance across the portfolio. Since completing the acquisition, we have paid down approximately 3.5 billion dollars in debt.","In March, we achieved upgrades to investment grade from S&P Global and Moody's and we have continued to produce strong cash flow from operations. As a result of our successful progress with integration and free cash flow in excess of investment needs, we expect to pay down a variable rate outstanding debt. The Company has an existing 1 billion board authorization to repurchase shares and will continue to evaluate share repurchases in 2019, we plan to provide more information related to our capital allocation strategy in 2019.","In summary, we continue to focus and make meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both brands. We are well-positioned in a most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increase value for our long-term shareholders. The combination of more than 15,000 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers in all types of markets. This combination of two great brands provides great flexibility in managing our future growth.","Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I would just like to make a shout out to our store and field teams because after the hurricanes and recent fires. Many of our store associates and customers were personally affected by these storms, I want to personally and publicly share our thanks to the thousands of associates who work tirelessly to have their stores open and serve their customers and preparation for and then in recovery from the significant weather and fire events. We saw a great team work passion and dedication throughout the organization. My personal thanks for all the efforts made in our stores, our Marianna distribution center, support centers and our many vendor partners that enabled us to get the impacted stores back up and running in hours and days through and after these events.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead, with your question.","Michael Lasser","Gary, can you provide more context around your comment that mitigated 80% at Dollar Tree and 50% at Family Dollar of the 25% potential tariff? Does that mean that if the tariff flows through you will see a 20% hit at Dollar Tree and a 50% hit from that at those two banners? Or is there more to go? And as part of that, how have you been able to mitigate it such that -- could there will be affect to your customer from either lowering product quality, product size, or other factors?","Gary Philbin","Yes, and really it's, I'd call out the efforts of both merchandising teams. We are anticipating, I mean I wish it doesn't, but we are anticipating it's going to go to 25%. So, the number I'm referencing is that we expect the 25%. So the mitigation is based on that going through. And you have heard us mentioned how we have done it before. I mean it sounds like it's easy, it's not because we are touching a lot of SKUs.","The one thing you mention though is lower quality. We don\u2019t reduce quality. It could be account size change, but I would say it's probably been a bigger effort around where else can we buy things besides China compared to landed cost, a subtle thing, how do we make things to have better cubed to come across so that we can land it on the U.S. side at a better landed cost. If negotiation with our vendors who also know, this is a very important time with the kind of volumes that we can [indiscernible] some of the factories to negotiate that.","So it's never one thing, it's our efforts to negotiate very well on both sides, take a look at the items what do we have to have, what don't we have to have out, what can we change, what would you modify and how you pack it, but we're going to go into this, but this will be a year where we also have to be nimble because while other folks get to raise retails, including our Family Dollar banner as I've told folks before, our customers often don't have that extra dollar. So, we've got to be just better buyers and it's going to speak to both how we buy the specs we buy to and which countries we go to.","Michael Lasser","And just to clarify. Is there room to further mitigate the 20% at Dollar Tree and 50% at Family Dollar? And then just a follow-up, I think there's a prevailing view in the marketplace that given what the available for those days -- that Dollar Tree -- the enterprises operating margin continue to be under pressure for next year and down, I recognize it's early. So what would be the offset to all this factors that would allow your operating margin either flat or growing\u2026?","Gary Philbin","Well, to the first part on the imports, we are still working hard. Listen, this -- we've started in earnest in August, September, and we've made one trip, we still got things to buy in the back half of the year that's really the balance of what we have to mitigate. So, we're off to I think a real good start at both banners, more work to be done. And the pressure that comes, this is going to be a year where we're going have to understand what the customer between the tariffs, we've gone through a year of really nothing in my retail history, on seeing the lack of truck drivers that impacted freight, but I want to go into next year thinking that we have the right assortment in place for our customers first, and drive business and from there, there we get the chance to leverage some of our fixed cost and other things that we've always done to drive-up income. But as I look into 2019, this is going to be all about let's stay real close to our customer and what do we buy that they respond to you in both banners.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","John Heinbockel","Gary, let me start with, what's your broader thought on the Family Dollar store footprint, including the possible need for underperforming store closures? And then kind of tied to that when you think about the thousands of remodels next year plus the openings, your thoughts on the field organization's ability to handle all of that change in one year's time?","Gary Philbin","Well, agreed. I mean I think we boldly stepped out there and said, we're going to do really across both banners, but I'll stay focused on Family Dollar, a lot of renovations, more than we've done and the reasons we like that and it's important is what we're seeing in the current renovation. So, I would tell you the fields are excited. Everything, we've done John to get our folks incented and aligned to run better stores. Now here's a chance to change the four walls of their stores and we got to do it one store at a time, but the opportunity to drive more footsteps into the stores and improve top line I would tell you they're raising their hand, give me one of those.","The execution piece, we've got to be on top of our game. It's a lot because of what you do to enhance the store and reset it and the SKUs that come in and out. So, it's not a small task for the field team to execute, but we are up for it. This is our opportunity to make meaningful change at Family Dollar. It's how we have described it to our organization, they have seen the one\u2019s that\u2019s responding; I walked a recent store with both our RD and DM recently. Their eyes light up. The consistency in execution we are going to be all over that next year.","And I want to go through 2019 saying we did at least a thousand of them, and we were pleased with all of them. And that\u2019s going to be the bar that we set going into 2019, along with that is the re-banner. So just to call out as we have taken a look at the store and referenced to the broader question, we have taken a look at which stores are responding to the renovations and what is an urban versus rural, and the stores that are twinners, you might say well that\u2019s where we\u2019re harvesting some of those to become Dollar Trees.","So the opportunity to now understand that in a better way and as we continue our iterations of renovations and the stores that don't respond to that that we can sort of see that. The things that we had worked on on table stakes to get all stores to improve. Those are good things to work on retail. I think what we like about the renovations is that's what changes really the course of the future footsteps for that store and sort of breaks down for us. So that's our effort for 2019.","John Heinbockel","And then just secondly on the tariff topic, is the mitigation at Family Dollar the 50% versus 80% spread. Is that more a function of FDO does have pricing flexibility, right, where Dollar Tree doesn\u2019t? And if we did not get the 25%, let's assume we do, but if we did not get it, does that on the incremental 15, I assume your gut feel would be to reinvest that benefit into the business not keep it?","Gary Philbin","Well, listen, other people raise retails up or raise or lower them and for us, you have to be close enough to discuss, we don\u2019t have the same kind of value. The magic that Dollar Tree only works if they know that's worth more than a dollar because it is somewhere in their shopping universe, and in Family Dollar, we don't have, we always got flexibility. At Dollar Tree our promise is to have great value in the store not necessarily that item. At Family Dollar there are some basics that I want to make sure we are in place with, our teams still working hard on.","We have a big post-holiday trip. We will do better than where we are today. But at the end of it we may have to invest some of that to stay in place with the right items as we go into 2019. I don't think you can just say -- listen as the tariff goes to 25% it\u2019s a real thing, other retailers are going to be faced with that too and we are going to respond to it in our world the right way to make sure our customers see the right values in both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.","Operator","The next question will come from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Peter Keith","I wanted to just dig a little more into the renovation initiative around Family Dollar. So, Gary, last quarter you had said that, you are getting a mid-single digit comp lift. This quarter you said the store is performing better. Could you give us a sense on what some of the changes were driven that the better performance so we can hope to see that continue into 2019?","Gary Philbin","Well, exactly I mean I would say, it is not going to be one change, but I would just say this Peter as we went through really over the last 18 months. You put these stores out there you see what responds, it's easy to walk into the store, you like to layout, it always comes down to the look and feel, but I would tell you it's more around the assortment that the customer ultimately sees. So our latest iterations have focused on some of things the customer needs most I mean you heard us talk about consumables very important for Family Dollar, as a piece of the emphasis I think that the adjacencies that we've been talking about are paying-off for us.","Some of the price impact that we've been making throughout the store is a piece of it. I think, I would just tell you, you know what we've done that is that it finds us a way to get that last dollar when she is waiting for our check ounces as important as anything we've done in the store. So you know is it one thing, no, is it the combination of all of those effort that got us to that yes, and to me Peter the final judge for me and listen we'll continue to refine the I can't put a thermometer on this and tell you were all the way to the boarding point where we like it but I think we're pretty darn close. And I would just tell you that it shows-up in footsteps into the front door.","Peter Keith","Okay, thanks for that. I did also want to dig into the opportunity for combined supply chain, and you have the St. George, Utah test, it's going on for two years. So certainly can appreciate, it's a complicated initiative, but also surprised that it's been a two year test. Could you give us a sense on what's taken so long at this point? And as you are looking forward, when can we begin to expect to see this broaden out to more of the DC network?","Gary Philbin","While it is complicated thank you for recognizing that, and it's -- we're past the test stage. I mean we've build our latest DCs in Warrensburg, Missouri. Now with the same systems that St. George allowed us to ship both banners. The difference and the issue really has been as we re-bannered stores from Family Dollar to Dollar Tree as stores were divested than re-bannered from Family Dollar, all of the capacity needs over the last three years have been on the Dollar Tree side.","And so while Warrensburg has the capacity at this point, we need the capacity for Dollar Tree at some point, Family Dollar will show-up there. And so I think where you're going to see it is the new DCs will get to that ability to ship first. And then we have as we shift volume to and from in the network then we'll have a better opportunity to go back into some of the locations probably on the Family Dollar DC side, where they have a capacity to ship to Dollar Tree stores. We don't -- working on that, I don't have a timeline to tell the street that, that when it's going to happen it's still ahead of us, but we are planning for.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Dan Wewer","Kevin, I wanted to ask you about the cost of the renovations and also the time to complete a renovation? And just to confirm, if the sales lift now exceeding that mid single digit rate that you had alluded to in the past?","Kevin Wampler","I think from a cost perspective what we've said is, it really ranges from probably 100,000 to 150,000 and the big variable is always going to be the number or amount of refrigerated and cooler units and freezer units that we may be putting into that store, so that\u2019s the biggest variable. And the typical renovation, it takes us only about two weeks. So it's a very coordinated effort as you can imagine to because there are some pretty significant changes in regards to moving layout, changing the storefront and as well as adding immediate consumption coolers to the front of the stores, so it's well coordinated.","I think we feel pretty good about the work we've done to get that down to a pretty nimble timeline. And then in regards to your question mid single digit cost and obviously Gary's comment is it higher, we haven\u2019t really specifically said how much higher but it is definitely higher than mid single digits.","Dan Wewer","During the two weeks to complete the renovation, we have a 1,000 of this taking place next year. Could this put additional pressure on your inventory strength accrual?","Kevin Wampler","Well, I think part of this is again you do really have to look at inventory in the stores and in some categories might get a little smaller, so there can be some inventory movement. But I would tell you just in general, we are not satisfied with where our shrink has been this year in either banner. It has not been a result that we are very proud of, it's something that we are working on.","And again, it's just not something that\u2019s you usually see out of us from an execution standpoint. So it's on the top of everybody's list out there and the operations plus prevention and the whole organization from the standpoint of understanding that this is just as important as driving sales out there. So I don't want to say it's going to put pressure on it because my expectation is we would have to do better next year.","Dan Wewer","And then, this is a quick follow-up question. If you had unlimited resources, both people and capital, how many Family Dollar renovations would you like to ultimately complete?","Kevin Wampler","There will be thousands.","Dan Wewer","Starts with the two or four\u2026","Kevin Wampler","No, it's really, I mean Dan, it's really an issue of -- listen thousand is a big number and I have said, minimum because I'm obviously hoping for more because that's how I'm thinking about it. But I think seriously from the standpoint of just is this a one year project, no. We will see the results of this larger group of stores helping us certainly as we get into '19 and more and more of them are behind us. But I would see us doing a similar number in '20.","Operator","The next question will come from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","Chuck Grom","Just beyond the remodels. Gary, when you think about investments that need to be made whether it would be labor, training, technology. What else do you think it needs to get done to right size the banner? And how do you think about the operating margin profile of the Family Dollar segment over the next couple of years with that in mind?","Gary Philbin","That's one of the reason were doing the renovations Chuck, is as stores open volume they leverage there for a while fix expenses, but I think you touched on the investments that are needed. I mean we've talked about and try to call out some of the big ones that we've done. Technology will continue to migrate to best in breed between the two banners on some of the systems that we need. We will continue to invest in our people especially within employment being at near or all time lows and just what we've done this year and what we call the year of the store manager to drive success store-by-store with improving our store manager prioritization how they direct, how they follow-up with people, I meant this is not either or we've got to do both.","Overtime, operating income, just now we still have our sight set and where we started this journey, we will continue to improve it. I think what I wanted to emphasize today is, we need to touch a meaningful amount of stores to get the consistency towards that trajectory that gets us there. And I caught-up before the things that we've been doing, the blocking and tackling on our table stakes all good retailers have to do that, but the equation that I want to change is to drive more renovations, unless when we do the re-banners too because you know right off the bat, if it's a right market and the right neighborhood adding a Dollar Tree assortment certainly changes a four wall cash immediately on that store with the sales dropping off.","But what we've seen is, customers do figure out eventually that is a Dollar Tree and we see multiyear comps coming from the re-banner segments that we've done. So when we find the right store do that, we do that too so between those two you go on few years you start getting better comps from this fleet of renovated stores that start to leverage your fixed expenses, you start to see re-banners that are opportunistic coming out of the Family Dollar fleet and falling into the Dollar Tree four wall cash model and I think that's how we take a look over the next few years on building the business plan.","Chuck Grom","And then my follow-up question would be just on comps variability across the Family Dollar banner. I'm just wondering, how wide is the performance across your stores? And is there a thought to close more stores in the coming years and some of the stores that I guess are potentially underperforming the chain?","Gary Philbin","I think that's the work we've really been doing on the store optimization on taking a look at okay to your point, we got stores that are we got good store we have great stores at Family Dollar, you got some that aren't where you want, so how do you fix them. As we've done the renovations we now have with the newly assortment and everything that we just talked about, well there's an answer. Some don't seem to respond the same way while maybe those should be re-banners some are just operational improvement we need to get as always the right team, the right effort from our operations and those that can't respond that might be too old, might be too small, we're dealing with our -- a big and order fleet of stores you know, at some point you got to see when we close them at least they they're being opportunistic.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","On the margin front, how are you thinking about freight and markdowns at both banners in the fourth quarter? And larger picture as we look to next year, do you see the opportunity to drive positive consolidated operating margin, as you put together all the headwinds and tailwinds as you see today on the horizon?","Kevin Wampler","Matt, as we speak to freight, I think we look at that as a continued headwind as we look at the fourth quarter. And again, diesel, well it's still up, believe in Q3 it was up roughly about 20% as a rate year-over-year with the recent pull back in oil prices that may dissipate a little bit in Q4 so that may come down a little bit, but freight in general I think is the driver shortage that's out there and the pressure, we are seeing from that we expect freight to continue to be up and even really potentially through the first half of next year, there could be some pressure as well, but again that\u2019s ongoing.","From a markdown perspective, it's really pretty much a non event in the green banner because they are just not that many markdowns. The Family Dollar business is obviously a little different from a markdown perspective. As we noted in Q3, markdowns were up partially to drive sales and partially to make sure we are moving through inventory appropriately. As we look at Q4 I would tell you I would expect markdowns in the Family Dollar business to be up year-over-year again, I think the opportunity to be aggressive when appropriate and to keep our inventory as clean as it can is very important. So I think that\u2019s there for us. And I think as we continue to push that business forward that\u2019s something we need to continue to look at.","In regards to 2019 obviously we haven\u2019t given any guidance at this point, and now we are finishing up really the planning and budgeting as it relates to 2019 so there is not really much I can say at this point and in time, but I would tell you what is our expectation that we move the business forward and improve the business and that's what's going to be our guiding principle as we go into 2019.","Operator","The next question will come from Greg Melich with Moffettnathanson. Please go ahead.","Greg Melich","I wanted just to follow-up on tariffs little bit, thanks for explaining how you are really working to mitigate it. Remind me, how much of your COGS if you disclosed or not already are on the current list? I think we had around 25% of COGS coming from China, but I don't think that was the current list.","Gary Philbin","The current tariff list I think we have declared that we have about 9% of our sales are coming through that are tariff at this point.","Greg Melich","And so if that extended that might be different, but that is what you're referencing was mitigating 50% or 80% of what's currently on the list.","Gary Philbin","That\u2019s right, the tariff 301 list is what's, we're referring.","Greg Melich","And then a follow-up from before, you mentioned getting the 100 million reinvestments of the 250 million tax savings. How should we think about that in terms of -- is there any left or do we re-repeat part of that investment next year? Provide me with the timing of that? Was that all of an investment this year or was some that 250 going to be in the following years?","Kevin Wampler","So, the 250 that's the 2018 benefit with us, reinvesting 100 million into labor and both in rate and hours, and that's not only stores that's also within our DC environment as well. So that will continue through Q4. I think as we look into 2019, my very early rate would tell you that there's likely to still be some general pressure on wages, just from competitive marketplaces, as well as some states continuing to increase their state mandated minimum wages, but I think that the 100 million really was related only through 2018.","Operator","Thank you. The final question will come from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Marisa Sullivan","This is Marisa Sullivan on for Robbie. I just wanted to see if you can comment a little bit on traffic trends at the Family Dollar banner and how they've trended in the third quarter and then quarter-to-date and whether we should be expecting a positive comp inflection at Family Dollar in the fourth quarter and what would be the drivers?","Gary Philbin","Well, we will go against I believe a one comp last fourth quarter. Here, we are striving off the holiday season in earnest to me the kick-off is a little bit of Thanksgiving, but probably more for our customers the first week of December. So all of our plans, all of our efforts, the alignment of getting the merchandise to the right stores, that's going be the proof in the pudding over the next few weeks, so we certainly we call it it's a big spike in our business as we march towards the December 25th.","So, listen, we were going to work hard on we're excited about the holiday season, I think we got our folks in the right place. We spent a lot of time in both of our field meetings way back in August to get them propped on the excitement of the items that we have in our stores. We've gotten into not just stores but on display, I think both banners really going into this year have really done a job to improve the holiday assortment.","And right now, we're sort of in the, you might say, trimmer home and trimmer tree segments, trimmer gift and gift giving is still ahead of us. So those are clearly the biggest categories. For Family Dollar, it will be I think opportunity for us to really share down toys with the void in the markets. We did lean into the toy business this year, and I think it's going to be an important part of us having a positive comp as we go through December.","Operator","Thank you for the question.

Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now I will turn the call over to Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This represents the first quarter that we\u2019ve owned the Family Dollar business for a full three months in the prior year's comparable quarter. Our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015.","Total sales for the third quarter increased 1.1% to $5 billion. As a reminder, third quarter results last year includes sales from 325 Family Dollar stores that were divested after the end of the quarter. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.8%. Operating income increased 53.1% to $342.4 million, net income for the quarter increased 109.4% to $171.6 million, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.72.","Adjusting for $0.09 of expense incurred outside of guidance that was associated with debt refinancing, adjusted EPS was $0.81 and near the top end of our guidance of $0.76 to $0.82 per diluted share.","I'm very pleased with our company's overall performance for the third quarter. We delivered our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments improved gross margin rate year-over-year. SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed, operating margin improved 230 basis points to 6.85% for the quarter, and adjusted earnings per share were at the top end of our range of guidance.","The Dollar Tree banner continues to show strong, consistent growth, and we continue to make meaningful progress in the integration of Family Dollar. We remain on track to achieve our expected synergies target of $300 million in run-rate by the end of the first three years. This includes improvements in direct and indirect procurement, rebannering of select stores, and the development of our shared services model including supply chain and logistics. There's still much more to be done, and I believe we will ultimately surpass our target.","Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the third quarter included a total sales increase of 8.6%, same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7%, and this was achieved through increases in both traffic and average ticket.","Gross profit margin improved 70 basis points over last year and operating margin was 11.6%, an improvement of 170 basis points over last year's 9.9%. Excluding acquisition-related costs in the prior year's quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points. To share some of the color on the quarter, top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner include snacks and beverages, household products, seasonal toys, and party supplies.","Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. While we continue to experience an estimated 80 basis points of incremental cannibalization resulting from the rebannering of 210 Deals stores and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, we delivered positive same-store sales each month throughout the quarter.","And despite the calendar shift this year, which moved the last two days of October and Halloween sales from third quarter into fourth quarter, we finished the third quarter strong. October was our highest comp month of the quarter.","Geographically, Dollar Tree\u2019s same-store sales growth for the quarter was strongest in the upper Midwest, the Southwest, the Northeast, and the West zones. All zones had positive comps with the exception of the Southeast which was only slightly negative as it experienced a higher degree of incremental cannibalization from our re-banner initiatives.","The Dollar Tree business continues to be strong, consistent, and growing. This represented our 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our third quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping our stores more often and we continue to attract new customers every day, and when these customers are in the store, they're buying more.","Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what one dollar can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements.","Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun, and friendly shopping experience and seasonal energy was high beginning in August with back-to-school. In addition to dominant displays of back-to-school basics, the customers responded favorably to brightly colored fashion stationary, teacher supplies, classroom essentials , and lunchbox values all priced at one dollar.","In September, we celebrated Dollar Tree's 30th anniversary with bonus buys and wow items for our customers. Key categories including cleaning supplies, home office essentials, snacks, and a broad assortment of special values from our million-dollar brands, our stores were built with well-known national brands and high value private labels throughout the event.","Seasonally, our store teams transitioned efficiently from back-to-school to fall harvest and Halloween. In September, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquarters with major statements in Halloween costumes, makeup, home decor, candy, and party supplies. Customers responded enthusiastically and our sell-through was improved over the prior year.","We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well-balanced, seasonally relevant, and stores prepared for the Thanksgiving Christmas and the fourth quarter holiday shopping season. Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth, and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and through increasing the productivity of all of our stores.","In the third quarter, we opened a total of 101 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated and expanded 15 Dollar Tree stores and we re-bannered 42 additional Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree's for a total of 158 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 8% compared to the prior year, and we ended the quarter with a total of 6320 Dollar Tree stores across North America.","I continue to be pleased with our rebannering efforts. Since the acquisition, our store development teams have re-bannered 210 deals stores to Dollar Tree and 293 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree in addition to opening 495 new Dollar Tree stores. We ended our third quarter this year with a total of 565 more Dollar Tree stores than the same time one year ago. These new and newly re-bannered stores are performing very well in terms of sales and improved operating margin.","While the right decision for the long-term and the near term, we continue to bear incremental cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 basis points. This headwind will dissipate each quarter through the end of 2017 as we cycle the conversions from the prior year.","In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our drive the business initiatives include category expansions, customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and eye care, as well as home and household products.","Creating a fun and enjoyable shopping experience was a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. In Dollar Tree we want to own the seasons at the dollar price point.","Number three, creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store that Dollar Tree always find an unexpected value, and number four, being first of the month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekends and especially at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs.","We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the third quarter we installed freezers and coolers in 154 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4710 stores with plans to continue growing.","With the addition of the Family Dollar banner we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create shareholder value as a combined organization. I continue to be as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We're employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar, and we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization.","With a focus on managing our business for the present, we're developing the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.","I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar's performance and priorities.","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. After five full quarter, we continue to make progress at Family Dollar. Our focus at Family Dollar is around the customer facing initiatives that our customers continue to give us credit for and we're working hard to improve these across our base of 8000 stores.","Our customers are seeing cleaner, better merchandise stores that have more compelling en-cap despite they need for everyday basics and holiday needs. While we have more to do here, we are on the right track with our continued investment in the business basics of the Family Dollar banner.","For Q3 the Family Dollar banner had low single-digit negative same-store sales. However August was slightly positive, September was our weakest comp during the quarter and remember last year we had kicked off our Red Tag clearance mid-month. October was also negative as we cycled the completion of our clearance event last year and of course the impact of Halloween in first month shifting money out of the core.","However we did see an acceleration of our two-year stacked comp of greater than 100 basis points from Q2 to Q3. And our Q3 basket improved slightly against the negative transactions for the quarter primarily from the clearance event last year. Our consumable business at Family Dollar outperformed our discretionary business and geographically our West and mid-Atlantic regions were the strongest performing areas of the country for us. ","In real estate we opened 52 new Family Dollar stores. We relocated or expanded 24 Family Dollar stores for a total of 76 projects. We re-bannered 42 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree and we ended the quarter with nearly 8000 Family Dollar stores, 7964 to be exact. We will achieve by year-end our target of 200 new Family Dollar stores for the year and together with Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners, we now have a total of over 14,000 store locations, 14,284 across the U.S. and Canada.","At Family Dollar our customer facing programs continue to drive and show value throughout the store as we build momentum with our smart ways to save marketing program. Our customers continue to respond to the value and savings across all our foundations on delivering value for our Family Dollar customer. These simple ways to say reflect from our ad into our store and these show our customers EDLP, pricing on everyday values, our sale items that reflect the most meaningful values on key items, dollar well, which drives a surprise and opening price point throughout the store, compare and save to shed out really our excellent values in our private brands, price drop which is our great savings passed on to our customers above and beyond, and during the quarter we completed our national rollout of smart coupons.","Our customers have responded positively with above projection sign-ups from our Labor Day kick off. We already have over 1 million customers have signed up. For our customers it completes a no hassle shopping experience to find national and Family Dollar exclusive offers.","Also we added emphasis to our smart ways to save strategy with the kickoff on the CW Network of our partnership of a 30 minute game show called Save to Win. Our host of the show Pat Neely highlights the great products found throughout the Family Dollar across a high-energy front format that Pat's competing real Family Dollar shoppers against each other. So for Family Dollar is a great way to reach a demographic overlap that serves us well and really brings additional credibility to our smart ways to say.","Another fundamental part of our strategy for success is our focus on table stakes. At a high level this includes improved store standards and conditions, neat, clean fully recovered, merchandising relevance and energy, finding what I need a Family Dollar and at a value I recognize, and customer engagement what we call Family Dollar friendly.","Our customers count on us all month long but the first 10 days of the month at Family Dollar are critical in their efforts to be in stock, recovered and en-caps with a compelling offer. Our focus here revolves around our efforts to have improved direct to store delivery, support and service along with our operational teams improving our truck to shelf process. The convenience of our stores combined with our focus on improvements across our customer facing initiatives is the foundation for our improved customer experience at Family Dollar.","Our investment across our business is measured with a test and learn discipline to measure our success and develop our next step initiatives just like at Dollar Tree, so while we have more to do, our team at Family Dollar is motivated and energized to be the best at delivering value to our customers that are unique in many ways and often underserved.","Our stores serve our customers that counts on us and response and we deliver value, customer service and the Family Dollar shopping experience that we're all proud of in the neighborhoods we serve.","Now let me turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our third quarter performance and our updated outlook on Q4 and the full year. Kevin?","Kevin Wampler","Thanks Gary, and good morning. Total sales for the third quarter grew 1.1% to $5 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.6% to $2.47 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 5.2% to $2.53 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted negatively by the loss of sales from 297 stores which we re-bannered as Dollar Tree stores in addition to the 325 stores which were divested as required by the FTC.","Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% versus 2.1% in the prior year's third quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket as expected we experienced incremental cannibalization of 80 basis points from the 507 Family Dollar and deals stores that have been converted to Dollar Tree stores.","Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.8%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly re-bannered Family Dollar and deals stores are considered new stores and were excluded from our same-store sales calculation in Q3.","Gross profit for the combined organization increased 8.6% to $1.52 billion for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter as a percent of sales gross profit margin improved 210 basis points to 30.4% versus 28.3% in the prior year quarter.","Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.8% during the third quarter and 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's third quarter. Factors impacting the segment gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise cost due to favorable freight cost of higher initial mark-on partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales.","On a GAAP basis gross profit for the Family Dollar segment increased 5.6% to $663.2 million. Gross profit margins for Family Dollar segment was 26.2% during the third quarter compared with 23.5% in the comparable prior-year period. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $38.4 million and markdowns of $30 million in the prior year's quarter, gross profit margin was 26.2% for the quarter compared with an adjusted 25.4% in the prior year's quarter. The improvement is due to lower merchandise freight and shrink costs partially offset by higher markdown expense and increased occupancy cost.","Selling, general and administered expenses in the quarter for the combined organization decreased to 23.6% from 23.8% in the same quarter last year as a percent of net sales. Excluding $11.8 million or 25 basis points of acquisition-related expenses in 2015, the SG&A rate remained consistent at 23.6%. Increases in store hourly payroll as a percent of net sales were offset by lower professional fees and lower depreciation expenses as a percent of sales.","Q3 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.2% and 90 basis point improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. Prior year's quarter included $11.8 million of acquisition-related costs, excluding the prior year's acquisition related cost SG&A as a percent of sales improved 40 basis points to 23.2% of sales from 23.6% of sales. The improvement was driven by lower costs as a percent of sales for professional fees, health insurance, store supplies and legal costs partially offset by higher store payroll expense.","On a GAAP basis SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment was $606.8 million. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 24% compared to 23.5% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $3.8 million for severance benefits, although prior year's comparable period included $6.8 million of acquisition-related and divestiture costs.","Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 50 basis points as a percent of sales to 23.8% from 23.3% in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher store payroll, health insurance and advertising costs partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense.","Operating income for the combined organization increased to $342.4 million compared with $223.7 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 6.8% for the quarter from 4.5% in last year's third quarter. ","Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 170 basis points to 11.6% when compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the $11.8 million in acquisition related cost from the prior year's quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 120 basis points to 11.6% compared to an adjusted 10.4% of sales in the prior year third quarter.","On a GAAP basis operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $57.5 million to 2.2% as a percent of net sales. ","Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $112.2 million which is comprised primarily of net interest expense, as well as $26.6 million of acceleration of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs and $2.6 million in fees associated with our debt refinancing.","Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.5% compared to 34.3% in the prior year's quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to a one-time tax benefit in the third quarter of 2016 of $21.4 million or $0.09 per share related to a 1% decrease in North Carolina's state tax rate which decreased the deferred tax liability related to the Tradename intangible assets, as well as the adoption of ASU number 2016-09 under which the incremental tax benefit recognized upon RSU restricted stock vesting in the quarter and income tax expense.","For the third quarter the company had GAAP net income of $171.6 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net income of $81.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter.","Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $733.8 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Our outstanding debt is approximately $7.1 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion from the end of the third quarter of 2015. ","Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 8.5% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased to 8.2%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 0.4%. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the fourth quarter. ","Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 2.1% from the same period last year and increased 0.7% on a selling square foot basis. We're pleased with the progress we're seeing at in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the fourth quarter.","Capital expenditures were $95.6 million in the third quarter 2016 versus $169.5 million in the third quarter of last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $620 million to $650 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels including few development stores, our re-banner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $157.6 million for the third quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.3 million for the favorable lease rights amortization. Depreciation expense was $168.7 million in the third quarter of last year.","For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This includes $17.9 million for Q4 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases.","Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions. Beginning in Q4 our acquired Family Dollar stores will be included in our reported same-store sales. In 2016 the last few days of October our biggest Halloween sales is shifted into our fourth quarter. This shift is included in our sales guidance. Two are two additional sales days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2016.","We'll continue to experience a higher than normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our re-banner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our re-banner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We have budgeted lower freight and import trade costs than a year ago.","Our interest expense will be approximately $79 million in Q4. Our Q4 and full year guidance includes an impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and overtime regulations which takes effect December 1. We cannot predict the future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates.","Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36.3% for the fourth quarter and 33% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.1 million shares in Q4 and 236.7 million for the full year. ","For the fourth quarter, we're forecasting total sales to range from $5.59 billion to $5.69 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis is in the range of $1.24 to $1.33 an increase from our prior implied guidance of $1.21 to $1.30. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increases in both our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.9%.","For fiscal 2016, we're now forecasting total sales in a range between $20.67 billion and $20.77 billion compared to the company's previously expected range of $20.69 billion and $20.87 billion.","The Company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full-year 2016 will range between $3.67 and $3.76, which includes the effect of $0.09 of refinancing cost in the third quarter. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.67 to $3.82, which did not include any refinancing cost. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase and a 3.9% of square footage growth.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Kevin.","Again, I\u2019m very pleased with our overall performance for the third quarter, and I\u2019m extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. We're making meaningful progress in developing what I consider to be the best model in small box value retail. Dollar Tree is now diversified combination of 6,000 store banner and 8,000 store banner each with its unique ability to effectively serve more customers across all types of markets.","With the combination of these two great brands we've powerful flexibility and how and where we choose to grow while expanding our opportunity to grow. Across combined banners we will continue to focus on providing greater values to our customers while delivering superior returns to our long-term shareholders. Retail is an ever-changing environment. Overtime we demonstrated our management team's ability to be agile and nimble to effectively adapt to the changing environment.","As discussed on prior calls we have been preparing for and testing changes to our compensation structure in regard to the new FLSA regulations. We have communicated these changes to our teams to ensure our company's compliance when the new rule will become effective on December 1. As always we will continue to employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communications, analysis, collaboration and incentives. ","We are confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history.","For 35 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter what the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. In the third quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.6%, same-store sales increased 1.7% and operating margin improved to 11.6%.","Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It\u2019s a great time to be Dollar Tree.","Operator, we are now ready for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first today to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward Kelly","Hi, good morning, guys. I'd like to start with a question on Family Dollar if we just take a step back, and maybe a little bit more detail on the assessment of the progress to date. The asset clearly holds a lot of opportunity. There clearly seems to be a lot of low-hanging fruit. You've made changes, but the comps have been bouncing around either up or down modestly. Curious how you think you - how are you progressing I guess so far versus what you initially thought? And then what happens from here to get the momentum of the business turned more positively?","Gary Philbin","Edward this is Gary. Good morning. I think you're absolutely right. The opportunity is just as big as we saw at the beginning, and as Bob said, we remain just as enthusiastic. A little bit of - when you take a look at the opportunity, it showed itself in the quarter and even though we were slightly negative for the quarter, August was positive and then we went against the Red Tag clearance event both in September and October.","So I wasn't able to overcome some of the traffic, I think the silver lining for me was that the basket lift that we got last year stuck with us this year. And then I would tell you, November is starting off, I would hope, going into the holiday season.","So I\u2019d start with saying the foundation that we're building around value, the marketing program, the table stakes, those are the things that we knew we had to do going in just to build the foundation, and anything else we're going to do past that, we have to stick because we're consistent on delivering value in the store and we have a shocking experience that our customers find value when they come to the door of a Family Dollar.","Long term, what's going to change? While we continue to have the opportunities in front of us that we can enhance private brands, of course, and we can do more direct imports, but we still have a store base that has wonderful opportunity for us to take a look and figure out how we continue to renovate, put in new assortments, expand the elements in our store that our customers are looking for, when we see our first-of-the-month of the business on SNAP for instance, some modest changes that drive business to our frozen food resonate very well with our customers.","So the work so far has been around the foundation that allows us to long-term deploy capital in a meaningful way into our existing store base along with new stores that will create different flow for our customers as she comes in, and sees more seasonal merchandise, sees more elements that drive higher sales per square foot productivity because of our assortment expansions.","So that's the work ahead of us. I would tell you that up to this point, we've been very focused on just driving the foundational pieces of our business that we had to fix and while we're not all the way there, I would tell you that we've made progress, and it's still our focus as we go into '17.","Edward Kelly","And just a quick follow-up. In terms of synergies, can you just tell us how much of the $300 million you've captured to date?","Kevin Wampler","We're right on schedule with what we said on the $300 million, we have never really quantified where we are on that, I'm very excited about the work that's been done there and what we\u2019ve accomplished so far. And as I said, I expect that we're going to the exceed $3 million over the three years. ","Edward Kelly","Okay. Thank you.","Kevin Wampler","$300 million.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Tanal","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just to follow-up on the synergy point, can you talk to the one-time costs that you expect to incur as you got there? Are we still thinking about 50% of $300 million as sort of in SG&A? And where are you at today relative to that kind of a number?","Bob Sasser","Yes, Stephen just to reset maybe where we laid that out, originally we said $300 million of one-time cost to achieve. We said half of it OpEx, half of it CapEx basically is how we're looking at it, at the beginning of the process.","I would tell you, as we -- as I look at it to where we're at to this point, we probably spent more CapEx and OpEx through this point because if you think about the number of stores, we've re-bannered as part of that, that's been a fairly large cost at the end of the day. We probably have spent more like I said, CapEx and OpEx.","But I still think the $300 million holds true. What I don't know exactly at this moment is will it maybe be 60% CapEx at the end of the day as opposed to 50%. I think there could be a little bit of movement in that direction as we think about not only re-banners but the systems integration and various other projects. We've got one DC that we have co-bannered.","So a lot of things that we've done have required capital dollars to make those changes. So I think it may lean a little bit closer - a little heavier on the CapEx side than the OpEx at the end of the day.","Stephen Tanal","Got it, that's helpful. I guess just on Family Dollar and thinking about the guidance for the fourth quarter, what gives you the confidence in the inflection there?","Bob Sasser","Well, it's - I think our comparison to last year where we know that we went to this holiday season. I think better merchandise, our stores are cleaner, they're better merchandised because we were exiting our Red Tag clearance event really into the second week of November last year was the final cleanup.","We've just gotten off to quicker, better start. I think our assortments are going to be compelling and our offers through from Thanksgiving through Christmas give us that confidence. And I think our customers are starting to recognize they can come into Family Dollar on a more consistent basis and find what they need, our in-stocks I would tell you, we triangulate on it from both what our systems says and then what have we done to ourselves that cause any missteps and then finally in store, what are we doing to have better in-stock and I would just tell you that those three pieces, we're in a better position now than a year ago.","And I think that's where our customer sees when she comes into our store, so that's what gives me the confidence and like I said, while it's early start to the holiday season, nothing tells me that we shouldn't have a positive comp on the quarter.","Stephen Tanal","That's great to hear. Just lastly for me, as I think about leverage in our models, how should it really play out from here? When do you expect to make bigger pay downs? Where do you expect to get over time sort of thing?","Bob Sasser","Sorry, you broke up a little bit, could you repeat the question.","Stephen Tanal","Yes, sorry, I was asking about just leverage and how that should play out from here. When you expect to make debt pay downs or how we should think about that leverage ratio over time? Thanks.","Bob Sasser","Yes, I mean obviously we reached long-term, our goal is to get back to investment grade with the refinancing we did here in the third quarter. We did pay down additional $242 million of debt and last year after the holiday season, we made a pay-down we will be in a position to consider that again this year.","As I look at it today, I think we have the opportunity to be investment grade by fiscal year 2019 and again, we think that's important just from a flexibility standpoint as we go forward and have the flexibility to be able to do whatever we want to do from a financing and again also from investment grade we will bring down the cost of capital overall as well.","So I guess how we're thinking about it is we're going to continue to build the business and invest in the business and grow the business, but we're also working to continue to pay down the debt as well.","Stephen Tanal","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. Gary, when we've had a chance to visit a lot of Family Dollar stores, the in-store standards looked terrific compared to where they were a year ago. But we also see that pricing remains somewhat higher relative to Dollar General and Walmart. My question is would you be willing to reinvest into more aggressive pricing at Family Dollar in an effort to regain market share at a faster rate?","Gary Philbin","Hi Dan, thank you. Thanks for the comments on the store conditions. It's something we're working hard on and proud of when we make progress, more to come but for pricing, I would tell you, we're aware of all the competitive checks out there and I would, I would just tell you it varies as you probably see by geography across the U.S. there are certainly pockets that are more competitive than others. I would tell you, our response is really built around our foundation of how we go to market still.","So from the standpoint of what do we do on like every retailer, what do we do on ad versions, but with us, we also have the ability to do price drops along with our base price, conversions along with playing our private brands, along with showing Dollar valve. And that gives me the flexibility that says, I can go to market with some or all of those to show the customer the value.","So, I\u2019m aware of where the competitive checks are when we go face-to-face with all those folks. But I want to maintain the flexibility at this point of putting the right offer for our customer in front of were on first of month and at the holiday. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m focused right now and it\u2019s not lost on me where everyone is out and we are responding. We think in the right way across those markets.","Dan Wewer","Just two real quick questions. One can you discuss how deflation impacted same-store sales for the Family Dollar segment? I guess the impact for Dollar Tree would be less. Then also, any comments on the Utah distribution center supporting both brands? And what is going to be the rollout for the other distribution centers supporting both brands going forward?","Bob Sasser","Well, I\u2019ll comment on the deflation. I mean, obviously we\u2019re not a grocery store, and I would say the biggest impact in a Family Dollar is obviously milk and eggs, bread to a lesser degree. You can see the impact in those categories, but I don\u2019t want to hang my hat, but that\u2019s been any impact.","I think our four walls what we can control is such a bigger opportunity for us to have those items in stock for first so month, and make sure our customers have it when they come into \u2013 we have it when they come into the store. That\u2019s our opportunity. And we\u2019ll roll through the price deflation as we go into next year and then we\u2019ll be back apples-to-apples.","Gary Philbin","The St. George's test that we rolled out earlier in the year, by the way went very smoothly and it was accomplished faster than we expected to be accomplished and high margins of the people who work together on both sides, both banners to make that happen. We\u2019re assessing the success of it and the savings that we\u2019re gating from it right now.","I think we need a few more \u2013 little more time to understand the operating metrics there and where their opportunities are to say as well as some other ideas that we\u2019ve got in logistics. I\u2019ll tell you that, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t settled in on the answer to your question, yes how many and when or what, but we\u2019re working very hard on deciding what that should be as we go forward as well as other opportunities that we have in the logistics network.","I believe that in the long-term that some of the highest returns and our synergies are going to come from our supply chain and how we manage our distribution network across the country, so big opportunities there, a lot of it\u2019s tied to IT integration.","That\u2019s a big part of the gating factor of the speed that we want \u2013 that we\u2019re going to be moving forward. But so far so good, we accomplished the combination very quickly, quicker than we thought and we\u2019re now looking at the results.","Dan Wewer","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. I wanted to discuss the puts and takes on EBIT margins in both banners. For the Tree, obviously a very strong result in 3Q; if you can just help us understand which of those drivers can sustain into the fourth quarter.","Then for Family Dollar, I believe it was about a 2.2% EBIT margin rate, which is lower than the run rate from the past few quarters. Help us understand what took place in 3Q and what will change going forward. Thanks.","Bob Sasser","Sure, Paul. So as we look at it, we look at the Dollar Tree banner. Obviously a very strong gross profit during the quarter with improvement of 80 basis points, and again, lower freight costs, better mark-on, obviously our merchant team has been doing a great job, continuing to the source unbelievable values at the $1 price point, and obviously, it\u2019s been a little bit of a buyers market to a certain extent on the discretionary side for the foreign purchases, so that's always helpful.","But again, what we always do is we manage that. We have to make sure that we\u2019re credit \u2013 providing a value to the consumer at Dollar price point, and that something that we've been able to do.","Freight in itself is been a benefit. I would tell you a couple of things. One, Q4 is the \u2013 the quarter in which we see basically a flip where diesel will not see a benefit. In the fourth quarter, diesel will actually be a slight headwind in the fourth quarter compared to last year than where the pricing was.","We have import benefits through our contract, which goes through the end of April, but obviously, that landscape is changing as well as we go forward, so that we \u2013 keep that in mind, but so \u2013 but I would think for the fourth quarter we would expect to see our gross profit continue to expand on the Dollar Tree banner.","On the SG&A side of the equation, we saw some various moving pieces, as I spoke to in a sense of lower costs for professional fees, health insurance, store supplies and legal costs but we also had investments store payroll. So we do believe it's important.","We will continue to invest in store payroll as we go forward. We believe it\u2019s important aspect of running good stores that our customers expect as we go forward in the conditions and merchandise and full fun and friendly, so we think that will continue. But, so I would say there is opportunity on the SG&A on an overall basis but I think probably gross profit is a little bit bigger potential.","If you look at Family Dollar, Family Dollar on a GAAP basis basically improved from a flat operating margins were 2.2 operating margin for the quarter. I think you have a lot of different moving pieces. On an adjusted basis you saw improvement in the gross profit line items, and really again we saw improvement mark-on and improvement in freight and improvement in shrink. And I think those are areas we think we can continue to improve upon.","And I would tell you that one of the call ups was higher marked down. But I think that is somewhat that is really a condition of last year. You remember right in Q2 last year, we took $60 million reserve for markdowns for the Red Tag clearance sales. We spent half of that in Q3, so we are able to take that reserve to offset some of those markdowns in Q3. So our Q3 markdowns last year probably little below what they would be on a normal run rate basis, so that was not unexpected at the end of the day.","On an SG&A basis, I think, one of things we have going on is we do have a geography change going on in the Family Dollar P&L between merchandise margin and advertising. So we are getting \u2013 we're taking \u2013 we\u2019re not taking co-op dollar, we\u2019re getting it net cost upfront in the products. So we're seeing an increase in advertising which was called out in my comments, prepared comments, and that will continue as we go forward.","So, but otherwise, we've also had store payroll investments as well as Family Dollar. So some puts and takes there as well, but on a go forward basis, we do expect there maybe some investments there but I would expect that depreciation and amortization on a Family Dollar banner will continue to decrease as we\u2019ve cycled through the comparisons of the harmonization of depreciation policies and the favorable lease rights. So somewhat of a long-winded answer but that\u2019s kind of the puts and takes Paul that\u2019s for you.","Paul Trussell","No, that's very helpful color, thank you. My follow-up just to Gary. Just regarding Family Dollar merchandise assortment, as you mentioned certainly there's a more compelling offering. If you can just help us better understand what categories we should see when we walk in the store, the kind of greatest rate of change over the near term, whether that's on the seasonal side and your approach to the holidays. Also maybe just discuss just what are the -- what you are implementing from a consumables standpoint.","Gary Philbin","Paul, I would say what we worked hard on, I would help you to see walk into a Family Dollar now, just the fact that end caps reflect more of what we have in our ad and the seasonal relevance and the holidays, and we have cleaned up obviously from a year ago. Really the merchandise did not have a home and they tended to collect on end caps.","So our ability to put in front of the customer what she wants on weekly, monthly and during the holiday basis is by far the biggest difference that you are going to see at our Family Dollar. The tweaks that you see on assortments going up and down the aisles, really reflect around what we think our customer is most interested in and that reflects around our basics and things like candy and our consumable business including frozen food, which drives traffic in our discretionary business.","We still have a strong apparel business on ladies that is seasonally relevant and driven by a cold weather, which looks like we\u2019re finally going to get a good as we go into the Thanksgiving holiday. And just around the seasonal displays an impact, much like you see sometimes at Dollar Tree, the things our customers need and left few days going up to a holiday. Family Dollar shopper shops so much later in the season than our ability to get ready for that and to have those displays on the floor or on the shelf are very important for us.","All that being said, I would tell you the biggest lever of Family Dollar had at the beginning of this process was just getting in stock and that\u2019s how we continued to work on every day of the week to make sure that we haven't with support from our DSD suppliers as well as what we\u2019re touching from the back door to our shelf.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","And we do have time for a couple of more questions. We\u2019ll take our next from Michael Lasser of UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Gary, you mentioned that November is starting off how you had hoped with markets interpreting that the business is comping positive. Would that still be the case if you adjust for Halloween shifting into the early part of this quarter?","Can you also, as part of that, discuss maybe what's not working as well as what you thought? The intent here is to understand where the biggest opportunities for improvement are to really put the business on a sustainable comp path higher.","Gary Philbin","Well, I know you haven\u2019t done all of the math on how \u2013 we just tagged we had a good first of month Michael for the first 10 day, so sort of forgetting where Halloween impacted us those first two days really a lot of our focus is what's happening to us from the first through the 10th of the month and that is where we saw nice impact on first of month and we\u2019ve been able to sustain that kind of activity through the additional weeks.","Big week in front of us, obviously, but I would say it's \u2013 we\u2019re going into the very meat of the holiday obviously this week and kick-off on Thursday going to the balance of the quarter into Christmas. And then we\u2019ll keep our fingers crossed on whether most of which have just the right amount cold weather to sell all of our apparel that we need and not too much know that people can\u2019t get to the stores.","That being said, what's the biggest opportunity I would say besides the basics I've mentioned on being in-stock and compelling values is then renovation of some of our store base, because we are still on risk in the older stores at Family Dollar that require either perhaps some deferred maintenance but maybe even more than that gaining their right assortment in the store with the right amount of square footage for each of the departments.","And that's where we see the past long-term drive that sustained cost at Family Dollar to \u2013 that\u2019s the basics in retail but having the right assortment and part of that is how is it set up in each of our stores. So, let me take a look at the Family Dollar fleet. It works against us right now where we have a large fleet of order stores. The upside is once we get into them and renovate them, there's a long runway there for us to keep improvement across our store base.","Michael Lasser","That's helpful. My follow-up question is, if you look back at your projections at the outset of your path to improve Family Dollar, are you having to invest more merchandise margin dollars and operating expense dollars than you originally expected, either because of what you have learned about the business or because the operating environment is different than what you thought because of factors like deflation or price competition?","Gary Philbin","That's a good question. I don't know, I can say how I thought about from the beginning to now. I think what \u2013 we've gotten the benefit of is the work on synergy has given us the ability to see that, when we take a look at the margin expansion of Family Dollar, a good piece of that is the synergy work. Another good chunk of that is what we just do at Family Dollar in terms of auctioning and getting the best cost and as markets go up and down, making sure we're getting through net cost.","I think the synergy work over the long-term will give us flexibility. So, you know, while we said when $300 million I think we\u2019ve all said we would be disappointed if that's all we ended up with.","So the flexibility that that gives us a Family Dollar to say where should we invest it now. We went into knowing that we had deferred maintenance and CapEx to put in the stores. We\u2019re on \u2013 we've been following that model.","It's sequenced in a way that gives us a biggest feedback. We've invested in store labor, because we just quietly needed to give our customer a better shopping experience, but that was, that's proceeding as we\u2019ve projected.","So I don't know that\u2019s \u2013 it's changed from what we thought. It certainly never quite goes maybe as fast as I would like to see it happen, but I would \u2013 I feel that we're on track with the things, with the big levers that we start with the Family Dollar.","We have stayed focused on and stay true to. And at the end of the day staying focused on what our customer\u2019s will give us credit for, and that's maybe the anchor that we went into this work. That's where we are today.","Michael Lasser","Thanks, again, and have a great holiday.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question today from John Zolidis with Buckingham.","John Zolidis","Thanks for fitting me in. Question on Family Dollar; you mentioned the in-stocks being the most important lever. If I think back to the management of the business under the prior regime, one of the things that was tried at various times was to change the SKU counts, increase the assortments in terms of total choice. Particularly in HVA; that was the category where they took assortment counts up and then --.","And so what I'm wondering - and this is partially based on visiting the stores and sometimes noting that the Family Dollar stores appear to have fewer items or choices than some comparable format retailers - where do you think you are with the breadth of the assortment in the stores? Do they need to increase, decrease? And how does that relate to the efforts to get in-stocks in place as you move forward? Thanks.","Bob Sasser","John, I think it's \u2013 I think what you're going to see \u2013 listen, its not going to be dramatic big bang or you see hundreds of skews dropout one week over the past week. I think our measured approach here is really been doing line reviews and really taking a look at the skews that are most meaningful for our Family Dollar customer, what's responding to us as we put against the backdrop of our Smart Ways to Save.","And, we're going to take a look really 4 feet by 4 feet as, what's the reason to have the offering that's in front of the customer, and have the right assortment. I'm not caught up in skew count. That's a certainly a piece of it as much as it is on how I'm going to drive productivity and profitability 4 feet by 4 feet to the store.","And so, I think while the two are related, I really think a little bit is how do I get the right assortment at Family Dollar across these categories? You'll see some additional expansions in the future on some categories. But clearly, we had an opportunity to just get ourselves looking through the lens of value from our customer to have the right assortment at Family Dollar.","The in-stock piece while related is the opportunity for us just to make sure that we're in stock on shelf for our customer, and that's a work we're working very hard on to make sure that we have, especially the first 10 days of the month, but have the items that are most meaningful for the customer on the shelf. So the two are hand in glove but I sort of view them independently in terms of our work processes.","John Zolidis","Great. Thanks for that and Happy Thanksgiving to everyone.","Operator","And we will have time for one more question. We'll take it from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. And Mr. Boss, please check your mute button, we're unable to hear you. Mr. Boss, your line is open. Please go ahead.","And with no response, we will move to our next, we will go to Alvin Concepcion with Citi.","Alvin Concepcion","Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to ask about the competitive promotional environment, what you saw in the third quarter into November, perhaps sequential or year-over-year. I think you said you were comfortable with your competitive response, so would you consider it pretty rational out there? Just general observations would be helpful.","Bob Sasser","Alvin it's Bob. Just a couple of notes on the competition from a Dollar Tree perspective as well as Family Dollar perspective, we've always seen highly competitive in our sector discount store sector. So it continues to be, we see a lot of activity out there, especially now with the Big Box and the grocery stores and especially on the food side of the business. From the Dollar Tree side, we're pretty well insulated from that, from the standpoint of our goal is to offer the greatest value to the customer for Dollar and the ever-changing mix.","So we don't always exactly the same items as some of the Big Box retailers or even the Family Dollar's small box sector. So from the Family Dollar - from the Dollar Tree side, we watch what the competitors are doing as always, but we're really focused on the customer and offering the best value there, that's about half of our business.","The other half of our business is Family Dollar, and more traditional type of a business, more planogram. We sell a lot more of the same things that others sell. We've been watching that as Gary said, we shop religiously with competition, whoever they maybe across a broad geography and very thoroughly and we take that information and react to it accordingly. Really keeping the focus on what's important to our customers.","We want to do, what's in the best interest of our customers what they're offering and offer more value and more ways. One of the things at Family Dollar and I'm extremely excited about that was touched on really maybe on the last question was the things that we've done and how - what maybe has been accomplished and one of the major accomplishments, I see is our smart ways to save marketing program.","The stores - the store is what we're selling to our customers more to it than just an item or product is the shopping experience and it's an stock, in store and that's the whole idea of your Family Dollar store and customer engagement in the stores.","So we've made a lot of progress on our smart ways to say everyday low price as Gary says throughout the store sale items, frequent sale items, our Dollar well in our stores, it's not a Dollar Tree but we have a Dollar well section in our Family Dollar Stores, it has gained a lot of traction.","Our price drop program continues to find traction and interest from the customers, our shopping compared with our private label and the newest one is our digital coupon that Gary said at a short period of time, we had over million customers signed up for.","So, just that idea of engaging with our customers, the store matches the ad, the ad matches the store when a customer comes in, there is an expectation of being in-stock in business, finding what they need, may not be as many skews as the Big Box guys, we don\u2019t have room for everything but what we have is what our customers expect to have and we have it in-stock, every day, as well as our add items.","So I look at the competition always and I'm very much as we are all students of retailing, that at the end of the day, all of our actions are focused on the customer and executing our plan to that customer, we're going to be competitive, we're going to be appropriately competitive, we're going to shop the market, but we look at for more ways to engage the customer to offer even more value than our competitors offer that takes a little time.","But frankly, I think we're right on target with that and the building of the foundation that will expand into the future for years into the future, I think that's one of the most important things that we can do as retailers build, this Family Dollar business, so that survives - there is always going to be a price issue here, there is always going to be emphasis on one category or the other. What will stand the test of time is how we\u2019re serving our customers are from the best product, at the best price, and a shopping experience that they expect.","Alvin Concepcion","Thank you. And my follow-up is just a quick one for you. Did you see any impact from Hurricane Matthew or SNAP to your comps this quarter?","Bob Sasser","We didn\u2019t even mention Hurricane for a good reason, because I was - I thought about it but if I said anything about the Hurricane, yes, there was an impact. But our people did such a fabulous job of getting through that. We had stores closed. We had stores without electricity. We lost service from our Savannah distribution center for days because we couldn't get workers to the D.C. in order to serve. We were servicing stores in that area, out of our South Carolina distribution center for example and for a Dollar Tree.","So our store teams and our logistics teams and everyone just did a fabulous job in really difficult times. That was a Category 4, came all the way from Florida up to Virginia off the coast. It hit a lot of people and created a lot of issues.","So out of that, we had some extra markdowns because we lost some electricity. We lost a few stores out of that, you see the results though and it\u2019s really - it did not bring us to our needs, it did not cripple us, our people did just a fabulous job on really scrambling to continue to serve the customer in the best way possible.","So we didn\u2019t speak to it because we came through it in rare fashion.","Alvin Concepcion","Thank you and happy holiday.","Operator","And at this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Randy Guiler for any additional or closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Thank you, Diana. Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, March 1, 2017. Have a great holiday.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Reid. Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy Reid","Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, and welcome to the Dollar Tree conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in our business. Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter financial performance and will provide guidance for the remainder of 2013.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, our most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K, all of which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so.","[Operator Instructions]","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, CEO of Dollar Tree. Bob?","Bob Sasser","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we announced our sales and earnings for the second quarter of 2013. Comp store sales increased 3.7%. This was on top of a 4.5% comp increase in the second quarter last year, and it was driven principally by a 3.1% increase in traffic and a 60 basis points increase in average ticket.","Total sales for the quarter grew 8.8% to $1.85 billion. Earnings for the second quarter were $0.56 per diluted share. This represents a 9.8% increase over last year's $0.51 per share. Operating income was $201.3 million, an increase of $16.9 million or 9.2% over last year. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.9%, an increase of 10 basis points over the second quarter last year. This was our highest second quarter operating margin ever as a public company. And net income rose 4.6% to $124.7 million.","For the first half of 2013 compared with last year, total sales were $3.72 billion, an increase of 8.5% compared with last year. Comp store sales increased 2.8% for the half. Earnings per share were $1.15, an increase of 13.9% compared with $1.01 per share in the first half last year. Operating income increased by $45.4 million. Operating margin increased 30 basis points to 11.2%, another first half record. And net income rose 9.7% to $258.2 million.","I'm pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Both top line sales and earnings were near the upper end of guidance, and comp store sales, momentum is building. Most importantly, we provided value to our customers and brought a record level of second quarter earnings to the bottom line.","We believe that our model is right for all times. In our current economy, with customers facing stubbornly high unemployment, unpredictable fuel prices and higher taxes, people continued to look to Dollar Tree as a destination for a balanced mix of high-value consumer products and a terrific assortment of fun, high-value and high-margin variety merchandise.","Sales increases in the second quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories, with our discretionary categories growing at a faster pace. Performance in the second quarter was relatively consistent across the country and all zones achieved positive comp store sales. The highest comps were in the Midwest, followed closely by the Southeast.","Our comps were positive every month, with our strongest performance in June. I'm especially proud of our Dollar Tree associates from every department in the company who work everyday to deliver on our promise of great value merchandise and a clean, bright and fun place for our customers to shop. Looking forward, we're excited about our growth potential and continued relevance to the customer.","Our plan is to continue growing our business by providing more value to a broader range of customers, and we're doing this in several ways. The first way is through organic new store growth. During the second quarter this year, we opened 81 new stores, relocated and expanded 32 existing stores and grew total square footage 7%.","Through the first half, we've added 175 new stores and expanded or relocated 48 stores. We ended the quarter with 4,842 stores, and we're on track with our plan for the full year 2013, which includes 340 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 415 projects across the U.S. and Canada.","In addition to opening more stores, we have a strategy to continue to open better and more productive stores. We continue to see strength in new store productivity. Last year, new store productivity reached its highest level since 2001, and through the first half, our 2013 class is tracking at a similar pace. This has been the result of a coordinated process, concentrating on improved site selection, rightsizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improved staffing and building the bench of qualified store management. Efforts to increase sales per square foot are not limited to new stores. In the past few quarters, we have described some of our category-specific initiatives to drive sales. Elements of the strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout the chain.","We have re-merchandised our checkout lanes and expanded assortments across the front end of our stores to create more merchandising energy and to drive impulse sales. We continue to rationalize and expand assortments across the chain in Stationery, Candy, Health and Beauty Care and Home and Household products to maintain relevance to our customers.","Store associates are emphasizing more effective customer engagement and working to drive sales of related items through cross-merchandising and suggestive selling. In all stores, we're developing more powerful seasonal and party presentations to create interest and a fun shopping experience, and we're rolling out freezers and coolers at a faster pace. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 215 additional stores for a total of 444 store installations in the first half.","We now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 2,993 stores.","With this increase, we raised our installation plans to 550 stores for the full year. This will be the most installations we have ever done in a year. This category serves the current needs of our customers, drives traffic into our stores and provides incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product.","Reflecting all of these initiatives, our top-performing categories in the second quarter were our checkout products, stationery, frozen and refrigerated products, candy and party supplies.","Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats, the expansion of our geographic reach and the development of additional channels of distribution, specifically that means Deal$, Dollar Tree Canada and Dollar Tree Direct. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ stores deliver low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home products. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deal$, we're able to serve more customers with more products at value prices every day. Awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing, and the concept is building momentum. We opened 7 new Deal$ stores in the second quarter, ending the quarter with a net total of 206 Deal$ stores, and we are on track with our growth plan for 2013.","Our Canadian integration and expansion continues on schedule. Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher-value product and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. Service level and in-stock position of basic products is increasing. The shopping experience continues to improve as our stores develop a more powerful seasonal presence. And through our investment in infrastructure, systems and training, we now have consistent year-on-year data on which to base our sales and assortment planning decisions.","At the same time, we're aggressively expanding our Canadian store base. We opened 9 new stores in the second quarter and ended the quarter with 160 Canadian stores, well on our way to achieving our plan to grow our store count by 25% for this year. In addition to opening new stores, we're re-merchandising and re-branding existing stores. We now have completed our planned re-branding of former Dollar Giant stores in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta. We will complete the re-branding of Dollar Giant stores to Dollar Tree Canada in the third quarter.","We see enormous potential in Canada. As previously reported, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. Our goal is to be the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point.","Dollar Tree Direct, our online business, continues to expand and develop. DTD is providing an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores. We've expanded our online offering by 30% this year. Dollar Tree and Deal$ Direct now offer more than 3,300 items online, including more than 1,500 items in less than case-packed quantities. Traffic on the site exceeded 5.4 million visitors in the second quarter, a 34% increase over the second quarter last year. And we continue to expand the Dollar Tree brand through social media with fun and engaging contests and 3 new YouTube videos in the second quarter.","One of the keys to achieving consistent profitable results has been our practice of building infrastructure and distribution capacity to support growth ahead of the need. In that regard, I want to update you on the status of 2 projects. First, the construction on our new 1 million-square-foot distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut was completed ahead of schedule and under budget -- under construction budget. With the earlier completion of construction, we staffed earlier and we began receiving and shipping merchandise to stores in the second quarter, well ahead of our planned third quarter startup. While the earlier opening increased cost in the second quarter, we were able to offer higher levels of service to our stores sooner. Longer term, DC10 will provide capacity for growth in the Northeast and increase network efficiencies.","Secondly -- second, we are currently expanding DC8 in Marietta, Oklahoma from 600,000 square feet to 1 million square feet. The expansion is proceeding on schedule with plans to be operational in third quarter. Both the Marietta expansion and the new Windsor DC are being financed through available cash.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance.","Kevin?","Kevin S. Wampler","Thanks, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 9.8% in the second quarter to $0.56. The increase resulted from our sales growth and a 10-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the second quarter last year.","Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 35% during the second quarter compared with 35.2% reported in the second quarter last year. Several factors contributed to this performance. Distribution expenses increased 20 basis points, reflecting the incremental expense associated with the ramp up of our new DC in Windsor, Connecticut and maintaining a high level of service to stores as we realigned DCs consistent with our added capacity.","In addition, shrink expense increased by 15 basis points, while it remained below 2% of sales. These factors were partially offset by higher initial markup across many categories, reflecting continued improvements in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model.","Discretionary product grew by 35 basis points as a percent of our total sales compared with the second quarter last year. SG&A expenses were 24.1% of sales for the quarter, a 30-basis-point improvement from the second quarter last year. Operating expenses declined by about 20 basis points, due principally to reduced expenses for inventory services, insurance and utilities, which offset increases in legal fees and store supplies. Payroll-related expenses declined by 10 basis points, as leverage on field management payroll and lower expenses for retirement plan contributions offset increases in workers' compensation and health insurance benefit expenses relative to the second quarter last year.","Operating income increased $16.9 million compared to the second quarter last year, and operating margin was 10.9%, an improvement of 10 basis points on top of the very strong 10.8% operating margin in the second quarter last year.","The tax rate for the quarter was 37.9% compared to 35% from the second quarter last year. The current year rate negatively affected EPS by $0.025 compared with the lower tax rate in the second quarter last year. As a reminder, the lower rate last year was primarily the result of statute expirations and the settlement of a state tax audit.","Looking at the balance sheet and the statement of cash flow, cash investments at quarter end totaled $413.7 million versus $379.8 million at the end of the second quarter of 2012. During the second quarter, we repurchased 886,000 shares of Dollar Tree stock for $43.7 million. At quarter end, we had $748 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter was 224.3 million.","Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 14.2% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot at cost increased 6.7%. This reflects primarily an increase in goods in our supply chain including inventory for our new DC in Windsor, Connecticut, and merchandise to support our initiatives in stationery, checkout and party. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings in our third quarter sales initiatives.","Capital expenditures were $96.4 million in the second quarter of 2013 versus $74.7 million in the second quarter last year. The majority of the increase is in our 2 distribution projects this year. For the full year, we continue to plan consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 550 stores, IT system enhancements, approximately $37 million towards the new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut, and $25 million for the expansion of our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma.","Depreciation and amortization was $46.6 million compared to $43 million in the second quarter last year. We expect depreciation expense of approximately $190 million to $195 million for the year.","Our guidance for the second half of 2013 includes several assumptions. First, Halloween shifts back into the third quarter this year, reflecting the retail calendar. We believe that this will shift approximately $5 million of revenue into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year. Comparable store sales are not impacted by this shift.","Second, the third quarter last year included $0.17 of earnings per share from the sale of our interest in Ollie's.","Third, in the third quarter last year, we recorded a realized gain of $3.8 million relating to the favorable resolution of a legal matter. Fourth, there are 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which presents a $25 million sales challenge in the fourth quarter. Also as you will remember, due to the retail calendar in 2012, it included 53 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 14 weeks. This extra week added $125 million of incremental sales and $0.08 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year last year.","And finally, our guidance assumes a tax rate of 37% for the third quarter and 37.7% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 224 million shares for the third quarter and 224.4 million shares for the full year. As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.","With this in mind, for the third quarter of 2013, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.87 billion to $1.92 billion, based on a low to mid single digit comparable store sales increase and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.59, an increase of 5.9% to 15.7% compared with the $0.51 of earnings per share in the third quarter of last year, absent the gain from the sale of Ollie's.","For the full fiscal year of 2013, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.85 billion to $7.97 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.3% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.77. This would represent an increase of 8.6% to 13.5% over 2012 earnings per share of $2.44, excluding the $0.08 benefit from the 53rd week and the $0.16 gain on an annualized basis from the sale of Ollie's in the third quarter of last year.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Kevin. Once again, I'm very pleased with our performance so far this year and I'm excited about our future. First half sales grew 8.5% to a record $3.72 billion, and comp store sales increased 2.8% on top of a 5.1% comp last year, driven by a combination of increased customer traffic and higher average ticket.","Our operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 11.2%, the highest first half operating margin in our history. Net income grew 9.7% to $258.2 million, and earnings per share increased by 13.9% to $1.15.","We're continuing to grow. We opened 175 new stores across the U.S. and Canada. And so far, the productivity of new store class is very strong. We expanded frozen and refrigerated product to 444 stores, more than any previous year. Dollar Tree has a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're expanding to support sustainable, profitable growth in the years ahead. We opened our new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut, ahead of schedule and under budget, and we're on schedule and on budget with the expansion of our Marietta, Oklahoma DC.","Looking forward, I believe that we're positioned to do even better in the future. Our business model is powerful and flexible. It's been tested by time and validated with the company's 27-year history. The Deal$ brand is gaining traction. Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach, and we're expanding our Canadian business according to plan.","We continue to manage our capital for the benefit of long-term shareholders. Over the past 4 quarters, we have invested $367 million for share repurchases, including $112 million in the first half of this year.","It's an exciting time at Dollar Tree. We had a great first half. As we enter the third quarter, our shelves are full of the right product, our stock rooms are in great shape and our merchandise values have never been higher.","We will now address your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Given the aggressive cooler rollout, I thought it was interesting that the discretionary continues to outperform consumables. Can you maybe talk about the cadence of comps in discretionary and consumables as the quarter progressed? And then maybe as a follow-up, any initial thoughts on the back-to-school season so far?","Bob Sasser","We don't break any of that out separately and I can't really comment on the back-to-school season. But I'm going to try to give you some color, the comps were consistent throughout the quarter. June was the highest comp in the quarter. I believe our variety business comped consistently higher than the consumer business throughout the quarter. That's a result of plans. Stephen, we're a variety store, we've always been a variety store. We service slightly higher demographic than others in our sector, $40,000 and up versus $40,000 and down. So we've always had a discretionary portion to our mix that we aspire to. One of the reasons we're amongst the highest in margins in our sector is because of our variety mix. It's a balanced mix. It's about 50-50. Sometimes it's 51-49, sometimes it varies a little bit. But it's typically a balanced mix. Our consumable business has grown a lot faster over the past several years for a couple of reasons. One is the rollout of the cooler program. We went from basically 0 to a lot of coolers, a whole brand-new business during that timeframe. We added and expanded a lot of the consumer product categories over the past -- almost all of them over the past 10 years and certainly a lot of them over the past 5 years. So those are newer businesses to us. But again, we're always striving to strike that balance, not only because it's what we are, it's what we do, it adds excitement in our stores with the seasonal product and the variety mix, and it also contributes a lot of margins. So we're very happy with the balance as it is. I would expect going forward, you will see some bouncing back and forth as we continue to drive sales and serve our customers in these difficult times. And you'll see a little bounce back and forth. But all in all, when you look at the big picture, it's somewhere in the 51-49 or 50-50 range.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I guess one quick follow-up, just on the gross margin line and on the distribution cost in particular. Are there still costs that you'll have to incur in the second -- or into the back half of the year? Maybe any color you can give in terms of how gross margin is playing in the guidance.","Bob Sasser","Well, our distribution cost, Stephen, I will just share with you, that I would expect the pressure to continue a little bit through the third quarter on distribution cost. I would expect it to mitigate somewhat in the fourth quarter, that's just my -- our feelings right now. We opened DC10 earlier, which is a good thing. We're proud, we opened it earlier and ahead of budget. But we did bring all those costs online earlier than anticipated. And the other thing is with our distribution, we run a very high level of service all the way up until the time we bring on a new distribution center. We don't sacrifice service to our stores or in-stock in our stores or any of that in anticipation of bringing a new DC online. So what that does is we have DCs running, servicing our stores at a high level and then we bring a new DC online. We bring the cost up on that, but we haven't really brought down some of the costs in the existing DCs where we're realigning now. So it's not just bringing a new DC on the ground, it's been the realignment of the entire network as it now shakes out with different service areas for different DCs. So that's what you've seen. This is the first brand new DC we've done probably in 5 years, I'm estimating, I can get the facts. But the others have been replacements over the past several years. This is the first brand new one that we've opened in some time. And it's not -- it's something we expected. But again, we weren't willing to give up service level to our stores in order to improve the distribution costs.","Operator","We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is a little bit a broader picture, I guess. We have seen some shaky results from some other retailers, and yet, your traffic was up pretty nicely in the quarter. When you kind of think about what happened to you guys in the back half of last year, how do you think about how 2-year stack should kind of flow through? Is there any reason that you can identify at this point that 2-year stack comps should start to flow in the back half?","Bob Sasser","We certainly are in the third quarter against our easiest comparison. I hesitate when I say easy in this environment, but our easiest comparison to last year is in the third quarter. So our expectation is that we're going to continue to grow our top line. We're going to continue to grow our comps. I haven't really looked at and don't have the stacks in front of me right at this minute for the rest of the year. But we are excited about our third quarter business. And the comparisons are much easier than they've been in some time.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, can you just comment on cadence of new store openings? Was it pretty much normal pace or was there anything back-end loaded? The new store productivity, you commented it was good but might be a little bit lower than, I think, we've been modeling.","Bob Sasser","Yes. And I think there have been a few changes and the jury is still out. And I get to see the granularity and, of course, we don't report the granularity and that's where my statement's coming from. But we did -- in the first half, we opened a few less stores than we did in the first half last year. Opened 175 new stores, I believe that's 12 less than we opened in the first half last year. But we also opened 25 new stores in January this year, which are really in last year's numbers. But ordinarily, this is the first time we've opened stores in January. We used to stop before the holidays and pick up with new store openings in first period, February. This year, we were able to accelerate our plan to get stores opened quicker, and instead of holding on to them, we just opened them up. So there was another 25 stores. If you added those into the first half, I think you'll find that we're actually ahead of the game. The real question though is for the rest of the year, we -- as I look at the rest of the year, we're on target and on plan to open all of the stores that we guided to. We opened a few less in the first half than last year, and we opened a little bit later in the first half than last year. One other thing I just want to point out to you, on the productivity, there's a pretty good range now between stores that we open up, productivity in our urban markets, our more densely populated markets and in our suburban and rural markets. So when you're looking at a small number, midyear, sort of a snapshot of 175 stores with others on the way, it really -- a few stores can make a big difference if you open -- and product -- sales productivity, if you open them up, a few more urban stores in the mix versus a few less suburban stores, that makes a big difference. If you do it the other way, that makes a big difference. As I look at where we are, I'm very comfortable with and happy with our productivity, so far this year. And I expect us to end up with another great year in sales productivity in our new stores.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Morry Brown with CL King.","Morry Brown - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","You called out the impulse items at the checkout as a top-performing category in the quarter. Can you give us a few more details around the performance of these items?","Bob Sasser","I can share with you the -- what we've done over, we've lowered the profile on the front of our stores. We've re-merchandised the entire front, the checkout stands, the aisles in front of the checkouts, the front end caps in front of the checkouts. From the time you enter the store till the time you leave the store, those checkouts are real focal points. And we've lowered our profile up there for a couple of reasons. Customer service, now our cashiers can better see the customers and our customers can see the cashiers. It's cleaner, it's a more -- it's less cluttered-looking with a lower profile. And we completely changed the mix. We've got a whole lot of new items on our checkout stands, all aimed at that impulse, that last-minute sale that we can get from the customer. The things in the aisle in front of the checkouts, we've given our customers a little more shopping space there. We have a trend fixture up there that changes and changes and changes. The hottest items, it's the hottest impulse items, it's new, it's trendy. And we're seeing the return from that as being really remarkable. And there's a lot of room to go. I mean, we can do better. But as we talk about the checkout assortment being the highest comp in the third quarter, it certainly has been, and it probably will be for quite some time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So with the balance sheet pretty strong and little debt on the books here, can you talk to potential opportunities on the capital allocation front and your current thinking regarding cash priority?","Kevin S. Wampler","Sure, Matt. I mean, I think you've heard us talk to this before. Obviously, as we think about cash, our first priority is always the business, growing the business and opening as many stores as we can, good profitable stores. And I think we're doing a good job there. Obviously, it's also building the infrastructure necessary, and we've had some bigger projects here the last year or so, with obviously DC10 at about $95 million, the expansion of Marietta at about $25 million. So those are very important to the overall ability to service our stores and continue to build our network, and for future growth as well. So obviously, that's always our first -- first and foremost in our minds. Obviously, beyond that, historically, the numbers would tell you that since 2004, we've repurchased $2.6 billion worth of stock. And over the last 3 years, it's closer to probably about $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion right now. And so we've looked at it, that's really where our free cash flow has went to at the end of the day. Historically, we've made acquisitions. Most recently, it's Canada. So it's not fair to say never, but there's nothing on the plate at the moment. So as we've said, we look at our capital structure, we talk to our board on a regular basis. And right now, we're very comfortable at where we're at, and we did buy back about -- just about 43.7 million here in the quarter of shares. So I think that's where we've continued to see where we put our cash to work at.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then, can you speak to any in-store initiatives to watch for in back-to-school and the second half? And also, Bob, if you can just elaborate on your earlier momentum building comment, I thought that was interesting.","Bob Sasser","Well, the 3.7 comp is certainly momentum building for us. The first half, we did a lot of great things in our stores, I call them great. Our stores really worked hard to get all the initiatives done. And they were -- for example, you asked about stationery in the first half, we expanded our stationery department. We started, I guess, in April and did a portion of the stores, and then we finished up a bunch in June, and just in time for back-to-school. So we felt going into back-to-school, we had the best back-to-school assortment ever. And we have the best stationery department ever and expanded the stationery department on top of that. So early in -- or late in the second quarter, we're already getting some good results from our stationery sales. So I'm real proud of what we've been able to do there. Our merchants have done a terrific job of rationalizing the assortment and creating an extreme value in the stationery business. We think it's a real growth department for us. And our stores really did heroic efforts on getting them relayed. And by the way, within payroll budgets. You'll notice our payroll was really good in the second quarter. So they did this in addition to everything else that they do. Other categories, we redid, we finalized our checkout, our front ends. We've expanded our Candy department in the past several months. We continue to improve on our seasonal opportunities. And I used to talk about second quarter as not being much driven by seasons, but now, we've made seasons out of things that weren't really big seasons at one time. You start off and you got May, you got Mother's Day, which has always been good, now with our cards and our balloons, we had a terrific Mother's Day going into then Memorial Day, with red, white and blue and picnics and all the things that go along with that. And then into June, and really starting in May and peaking in June, is our graduation season, which is -- it's always been there, but we've chosen to emphasize it. And our merchants did a great job of putting together a graduation assortment for parties and for all the things for the graduate, the new graduate. Our stores have done a terrific job of laying it out in the stores in an impactful way. And the biggest thing we had going in graduation, the most excitement I've seen for a while, is on our school colors promotions. So I guarantee, if you come to Dollar Tree, you can plan your party for your graduate and we will have your school colors. And we've expanded our colors, it was on our website. We did some outreach through social media. We promoted it in the stores. And as a result, graduation has become a really important season for us. Of course, Father's Day is buried in there somewhere. We recognize it, but it pales in comparison to most of the other holidays in the season. And then, of course, you end with -- in July with the Fourth of July, another patriotic red, white and blue celebration and picnicking and beverage and paper supplies and all the things you need for the beach and for the pool. So a lot of seasonal excitements in the quarter. We -- again, we tend to create seasons where they did not exist before.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffrey.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a follow-up on earlier question regarding the gross margin trends, that we've seen shrink kind of creep up here as a modest headwind the last 2 quarters. I guess kind of a 2-part question, should we expect that to continue through the rest of the year? And then also related on the gross margin, with the new DCs, would you then expect maybe some distribution expense leverage as we get into next year?","Kevin S. Wampler","So in regards to shrink, we have seen it creep up a little bit this year. And we're coming off of 3 years where it was basically at historical lows. So we've had some really great results. And it's edged up a little bit, and we're really -- we're basically 90% of the way through our inventory this year. So it's pretty much going to be where it's going to be, it kind of settled in. Again, it's still well below 2% at retail, which we think is a barometer that is important at the end of the day. So obviously, we're addressing it. There's various things that we think we can do internally to look at it and create some more focus around it and hopefully drive it back down to where it needs to go going into the next year. In regards to the gross margin and as it relates to the DCs, I think as Bob said, I think we expect within our guidance, there's costs associated with it going through the third quarter, as we continue to work through the changes in the network that it creates when you create capacity and you realign your stores within your distribution network. So that's built in, and we expect it to get a little bit better probably in the fourth quarter. But it does potentially create some opportunity for next year.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, very good. And then I just had one quick follow-up. With the large amount of coolers you've done so far this year in 444 stores, could you give us a breakdown on what percentage of those are in existing stores and what percent is in the new stores?","Kevin S. Wampler","Yes, we traditionally have already spoken to that at year end. So we haven't broken that out at this point in time. But I would tell you, in general, given the larger number, more of them are going into existing stores than new stores.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you can discuss 2 topics. One, if the 6 fewer days that you -- that were all there in the fourth quarter between Thanksgiving and Christmas impacts the comp or were you just talking about the impact on total sales? And then secondly, if you could speak to the markdown performance in the quarter.","Kevin S. Wampler","Sure. As we look at the fourth quarter and the $25 million headwinds -- headwind that we've referred to, there is some comp effect at the end of the day. The bottom line is with 6 less days, there's just certain -- there's a certain amount of -- people will run out of time before they realize it. And they just won't come to the stores in those days. They'll figure out that they'll make it by without maybe picking up that last item. So there is a little bit of effect, but that's obviously factored into our guidance. With regards to markdowns, markdowns remain very, very good. We have -- at a dollar price point, we really have minimal markdowns. I think we've been able to control those. From time-to-time, we will have some seasonal candies or something like that after we come through a season that you'll see at the front of our store markdown. But by and large, they're fairly minimal and really very immaterial to the gross margin overall.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","If I could follow-up on the calendar shifts, in the quarter you just reported, the comps came in a bit better than expected, but the total sales were slightly below the high end of the guidance. Was there any kind of effect from the quarter ending later than last year as you got further into back-to-school?","Kevin S. Wampler","I don't believe so, realistically, I don't believe there was an effect from that for the quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A question on inventories, up 6.7% per store. I understand the reasons you explained for the growth. But regardless, inventories are growing at a faster rate than either revenues or gross profit dollars. When do you envision that reversing itself, is it when we annualize the opening of the Connecticut distribution center?","Kevin S. Wampler","Dan, if you remember when we reported Q1, we were actually up. Inventory -- total inventories were up 15.4%, and we're up 7.9% on a selling square foot basis. So it's obviously come down and the expectation is that it will continue to come down as we go through the year. So I would expect we'll be a little bit better-shaped at the end of Q3 and then, again, a little bit better at the end of the year. So that's how we view that at this point.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And do you think that's the primary reason for the higher shrink, just the fact that you have 7% more inventory in the store and therefore, just a bigger opportunity for our inventory to disappear?","Kevin S. Wampler","Realistically, the increase is not all in the store at the end of the day. Part of it is in the supply chain, i.e. they're in the distribution centers a little bit or on the water coming to us. So the increase in the actual stores are something less than that 7 -- or excuse me, 6.7. So while there's a little bit more inventory, I don't think that's a major factor at the end of the day.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And Bob, one question for you regarding Deal$. When you acquired Dollar Giant, you're very quick to identify 1,000 store opportunities in Canada. You've been very clear about the 7,000 store potential for the Dollar Tree brand domestically. You're, obviously, very upbeat about Deal$, but curious as to why it's difficult to determine what's the potential rollout for Deal$? And when do you think you might have enough data to be able to give us an idea of how big that could be?","Bob Sasser","Yes, good question. It's a little different in the U.S. than it is in Canada. We bought Dollar Giant, and we don't have another chain up there. All we have is Dollar Giant in the country of Canada. And we have made plans, we looked at the markets, we looked at how many stores per customer that was already in Canada and how many more we thought we could do and we did an analysis, and we came up with the 1,000 store. And in the U.S., we got Dollar Tree, and Dollar Tree and Deal$. At a point in time, my vision is, at a point in time, that Dollar Tree will continue to grow, but maybe Deal$ will be growing at a faster pace at some point in time. Right now, they're both competing for the same capital. They're competing for real estate, they're competing for all the resources that you put behind with the Dollar Tree brand. And frankly, the best return on the dollar is a new Dollar Tree store anywhere, so -- whether it's Deal$ or anybody else out there. So we're still growing Dollar Tree really fast, and we're still growing it very profitably, and we've got a lot of room to grow, and we're bringing Deal$ along. We still have opportunities to build the brand in Deal$. When we go into a market, not everybody really knows what a Deal$ is and they know what a Dollar Tree is, so we've got to do some things around branding. And the margin and the return, while profitable, is still not as good as a Dollar Tree at this point. At some point, it's going to be a push, frankly. But right now, that's the reason I haven't chosen to quantify what I see as the long-term potential of the Deal$ stores in terms of number, and that's my reason.","Operator","We'll go next to John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Question about the ticket increase in the quarter, 60 bps. It's a little bit lower than what it was the last 2 quarters when it benefit. And it should have been benefiting, I believe, the MasterCard rollout, which you don't anniversary until, I believe, the third quarter. So I was wondering if you could talk about the penetration of credit during the quarter, whether that slowed, and if there's anything else going on that's affecting the size of the ticket.","Kevin S. Wampler","Sure, John. The penetration of debit and credit grew by 170 basis points year-over-year for the second quarter. And the majority of that was in the credit, not the debit side of the house. So today, roughly 40% of our transactions are either debit or credit. Again, about 2\/3 or just a little less than 2\/3 are debit, with the remaining being credit. So we are continuing to see an increase in penetration there. You're right, the MasterCard rollout where we really saw the effect was Q4 last year. So we are seeing some benefit from that. I would tell you just in general that the average ticket for a debit and credit transaction is coming down. And I think that's just a function of the fact that as a bigger portion of all transactions are debit and credit, on average, they're going to come down. So -- and I think that's just the trend, with retail in general, same with the increase of debit cards. And so there's no real surprise there, I guess, but it is just a little bit of a change in fact. So overall, I think we feel pretty good about our overall ticket growth in the sense that it continues to grow, we continue to focus on things where we can drive tickets such as the front end and checkout and impulse, as well as just doing a great job of merchandising our stores. So that's kind of the story of the ticket right now.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I wanted to touch on the coolers for a minute, if you could talk to the productivity of this year's class of coolers versus prior years. And then do you have any early view into how many coolers and freezers you plan to roll out next year?","Kevin S. Wampler","Well, with regards to next year, obviously, we haven't given any numbers on that. So really we won't do that until the beginning of next year, realistically. But this year's class is -- some of them are going into maybe little smaller stores than where we've had, than we've put them in the past. So we've got some traction there. I think in general, we don't see the productivity as being any different than what we've spoke to in the past. And what that has been is what we've said traditionally a 5% to 10% comp lift, and that's across the whole stores, not just in the consumables side of the business. We also see a comp lift on the discretionary side when we add freezers and coolers. So it's an important aspect to the overall store business. And we continue to like them. It obviously drives traffic into the stores, more frequent trips. A little bit lower margin, but at the end of the day, with the overall comp increasing in the store, we like what it does to the overall P&L.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just in terms of other store productivity initiatives, I just want to clarify that the stationery, checkout and party expansions are fully rolled out at this point and whether you -- can you give us any sense for what might be next in the back half of this year or maybe next year in terms of category changes or expansions?","Bob Sasser","Well, it never really ends, does it? We rolled out expanded stationery department, more SKUs, more square footage. As we go through and analyze our results over the months and quarters, we'll see productivity issues and we'll identify the categories that continue to grow, and those are going to continue to get more. You may end up with another expansion in stationery in the next year, depending on how we do with this one, the same thing with our party. And also in our Food, in our Candy, in our snacks, in our salty snacks and beverage and that side of the business. So it's really a function of how the customer is responding, what are the customers asking for, how they're responding to a category, whether we're over-spaced or under-spaced, or under-SKUed or over SKUed, and we continue to make those adjustments throughout the year. So this year, first quarter, first half, it was the checkouts, it was the front end, it was stationery, it was candy, it was party. There's always a few others, too, by the way, that we do in our home areas. It may not be the whole department, but could be subcategories that we expand or contract, always searching for that sweet spot for the customer today and staying relevant to the customer today. So for the past several years, we had expanded our consumer products, our cleaning supplies, our HBC, our food, candy and snacks faster, reducing some space in the variety area. This year, we've chosen to expand some of the variety categories, and we're seeing some good results in that. So I guess I'm just saying, it just never ends. It's always an ongoing analysis of the business and analysis of the customer, listening to the customer, what do they want, giving them more of what they want to buy.","Operator","This does conclude the question-and-answer portion of our call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Randy Guiler, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Guiler","Thank you, Melanie. Good morning and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree\u2019s performance for the second fiscal quarter of 2016. Participating on today\u2019s call will be our CEO, Bob Sasser; CFO, Kevin Wampler; and Family Dollar\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer, Gary Philbin.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors. These are included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K which are all on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements and you should not expect us to do so.","At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now I will turn the call over to Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced Dollar Tree\u2019s results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 included only one-month of Family Dollar performance as our acquisition was completed on July 6, 2015.","Total sales for the second quarter increased 65.9% to $5 billion, and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.1%.","Operating income increased 189.5% to $357.2 million, net income for the quarter was $170.2 million, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.72, which was the top end of our guidance of $0.66 to $0.72 per diluted share.","I\u2019m very pleased with our Company\u2019s overall performance for the second quarter. We delivered our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. The gross margin rate in both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners improved year-over-year.","SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed. Operating margin improved 300 basis points to 7.1% for the quarter and earnings per share were at the top of our range of guidance. We\u2019re making progress in the integration of Family Dollar and in the achievement of our previously announced run rate synergies of $300 million by the end of the third full-year post-acquisition.","This includes savings and direct and indirect procurement, improvements in sales and profitability from the re-bannering of underperforming stores and the development of our shared-services model, including supply chain and logistics. There\u2019s much more to be done, and I believe we\u2019re on pace to surpass our target.","Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner in the second quarter included a total sales increase of 8.5%. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%. I will add, this was in the face of headwinds from our re-bannered Family Dollar and Deals stores, and this was achieved through balanced increases in both traffic and average ticket.","Gross profit margin increased 20 basis points and operating margin improved 110 basis points from the prior year\u2019s quarter to 11%. Excluding acquisition-related costs from the prior year\u2019s quarter, operating margin improved 30 basis points. Top-performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner included party supplies, snacks and beverage, toys and household products.","Sales in our discretionary categories outpaced sales in our consumables for the quarter. And geographically, Dollar Tree banner same-store sales growth was strong as in the Midwest and in the Southwest. The Dollar Tree business continues to be strong, consistent and growing. This represented our 34th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. Our second quarter results once again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand.","Customers are shopping our stores more often, and we continue to attract new customers every day. And when these customers are in the store, they\u2019re buying more both traffic and average ticket contributed to our comp growth. Millions of consumers continue to look at Dollar Tree as part of the solution to help balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day.","Our merchant teams continue to do a terrific job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy and at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever, and our merchandise margin increased once again in the second quarter. Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience, and seasonal energy was high in May beginning with Mother\u2019s Day.","In addition to party essentials, Dollar Tree stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good, and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned to patriotic themes and the celebrations surrounding Memorial Day, picnics, pools, beaches and summer fun, reflecting the seasonal strength of Mother\u2019s Day and Memorial Day, along with a strong basics performance. May was the best month for comp store sales.","We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well balanced, seasonally relevant and stores prepared for the back-to-school season. Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores.","In the second quarter, we opened a total of 99 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 18 Dollar Tree stores. We re-bannered the remaining 32 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores, and we re-bannered 47 Family Dollar\u2019s to Dollar Trees for a total of 196 Dollar Tree projects during the quarter. Total Dollar Tree banner selling square footage increased 10.4% over the prior year, and we ended the quarter with a total of 6,184 Dollar Tree stores across North America.","Additionally, I\u2019m pleased to report that during the second quarter, we successfully completed the re-bannering of our Deals stores. As a reminder, 210 Deals stores were converted to Dollar Tree stores, nine Deals stores were converted to Family Dollar stores, and three were closed as their lease term expired. All of our resources and efforts are now dedicated to our two primary growth banners, Dollar Tree, where everything is a dollar and Family Dollar, your neighborhood discount store.","I\u2019m especially pleased with our re-bannering efforts. Over the past four quarters, our Dollar Tree banner store development teams have re-bannered 210 Deals stores to Dollar Tree and 251 underperforming Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree in addition to opening 384 new Dollar Tree stores.","As a result, we ended second quarter this year with a total of 845 more Dollar Tree stores than we ended the second quarter last year. These new and newly re-bannered stores are performing well in terms of sales and improved profitability. While this is the right decision for the long-term, and in the near-term, there was increased pressure from cannibalization on our comp stores of approximately 80 additional basis points during the second quarter. We expect this to be a headwind through the remainder of the year.","In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Our Drive The Business initiatives include category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products.","A fun and enjoyable shopping experience with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. We\u2019re driving the business by creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store.","And at Dollar Tree, you\u2019ll always find an unexpected value. And we\u2019re driving the business by being first-of-the-month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items on weekends and especially at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs.","We are continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the second quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 157 additional Dollar Tree banner stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 4,559 stores and growing. And we are well on our way with our plan to expand frozen and refrigerated to 400 additional stores in 2016.","We continue to invest in infrastructure. Dollar Tree DC11, our new 1.5 million square foot South Carolina distribution center, was completed on time and began serving stores in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions in June. The expansion of our Stockton, California DC is adding additional capacity as we grow in our West Coast stores. And the work to co-banner the Family Dollar DC in St. George, Utah has been completed. This DC is now servicing both banners from the same facility.","With the addition of the Family Dollar banner, we have an incredible opportunity to increase and create more shareholder value as a combined organization. I am as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to grow our business and to serve more customers in more ways. We are employing a disciplined approach to building the foundation for long-term improvements and the customer experience at Family Dollar. And we remain confident in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organizations.","With a focus on managing our business in real time, our eyes are on the future as we develop the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Gary to discuss Family Dollar\u2019s performance and priorities.","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. We continue to make progress at Family Dollar that\u2019s driving our performance and customer-facing initiatives. Now one-year into the integration, our customers are seeing stores that are cleaner, better merchandised on promotional end caps, elimination of old inventory and improvement on our in-stock position.","Certainly, more work is to be done across these important customer-facing initiatives. Our feedback has been positive. Store teams have received the tools to do better with these initiatives and have respond with great efforts to drive our in-store customer experience.","For second quarter, our same-store sales for the Family Dollar banner were slightly negative and were affected by the calendar shift, which moved the August 1 of the month from second quarter last year into third quarter of this year. Basket improved slightly against negative transactions. Our performance was balanced between discretionary and consumable, with consumables performing slightly better than our discretionary business. Strongest sales were at the beginning of the quarter, July was slightly negative. And geographically, comp store sales were strongest in our West and Mid-Atlantic regions.","In real estate, we opened 57 new Family Dollar stores, relocated or expanded 34 Family Dollar stores for a total of 91 total projects. We re-bannered 47 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, and seven others were in the process of conversion at quarter end. We ended the quarter with 7,945 Family Dollar stores, and we continue to track on achieving our previously announced target of 200 new Family Dollar stores in 2016.","At quarter end, we have total of over 14,000, 14,129, to be exact, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores across North America. At Family Dollar, our focus remains around three fundamental principles: know our customer, improve our shopping experience and drive the value equation for our customer. This translates into our customer-facing messaging in there and in-store, which is our smart ways to save program. We are pleased with the reception and traction from our customers.","The value at Family Dollar is built upon this simple thought, smart ways to save, based around EDLP pricing on key items for our customer, price drop on planned items for our customers shopping list, Dollar well items on key opening price point SKUs and compare and save for our most meaningful, incredible value private-brand items. We are also placing continued emphasis on our national brand items that are most meaningful and complemented with other value brands that emphasize the value of our assortments.","We continue to win back customers and drive additional visits. We\u2019ve worked on our promise to deliver a better customer experience. We call these our table stakes, the building of a foundation for an improved customer experience at Family Dollar. These include store standards and conditions, neat, clean, full, recovered, merchandising relevance and energy. Family Dollar has what I need and at a value I recognize and customer engagement. We call this Family Dollar-friendly.","Our team members are part of the neighborhood they serve. We are convenient and friendly. While some of these require investments in facilities or equipment or labor, not everything does as we continue to have our field teams make progress on the basics of truck-to-floor and recovery standards.","Our merchants and field teams are working hard to be first-of-the-month ready and weekend-ready, when our customers count on us the most. Displays and recovery around these important days are part of our planning and execution. We know our customers measure us against their view of store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service, speed of checkout.","We\u2019re working hard to deliver these elements across 8,000 stores. We can be the store of choice for our customers\u2019 basic shopping needs, along with the excitement of seeing the newness of the seasons and holidays. Our investment in the business and our table stakes initiatives are being managed with the same disciplined approach we built the Dollar Tree business for many years.","Our focus is on what our customer needs and gives us credit for, identifying a lot of ways important productivity enhancements that allow us to reduce cost within our systems and process, then reinvesting some of these savings again, where our customers will see benefit. Test and learn is part of the process and points us to the best areas to invest.","While we have more to do, we have a motivated team at Family Dollar that\u2019s intended to drive value to our customer that is often underserved and store teams that with the right tools, can win in their store neighborhood by neighborhood.","Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our second quarter financial performance and our updated outlook for Q3 and full-year 2016.","Kevin Wampler","Thanks, Gary, and good morning. As a reminder, the prior year\u2019s second quarter included one-month of performance for our Family Dollar segment, following the completion of our acquisition. Going forward, all year-over-year comparisons will include a full three months for the Family Dollar segment.","Total sales for the second quarter grew 65.9% to $5 billion, which includes our fourth full quarter of Family Dollar sales. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.5% to $2.39 billion, while Family Dollar segment total sales decreased 4.5% to $2.61 billion.","Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by the removal of 268 stores, which were re-bannered as Dollar Tree stores and 325 stores, which were divested as required by the FTC. The total reduction in Family Dollar store count as a result of re-bannering and divestiture is 593.","Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2% versus 2.7% in the prior year\u2019s second quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization from 465 Family Dollar and Deals stores, which have been converted to Dollar Tree stores.","As Bob mentioned, the incremental cannibalization was approximately 80 basis points for Q2. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, same-store sales grew 1.1%. All acquired Family Dollar stores and newly re-bannered Family Dollar and Deals stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation.","Gross profit for the combined organization increased 76.8% to $1.51 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. The majority of the $657.2 million increase was driven by the addition of Family Dollar\u2019s gross profit for the full quarter of $588.4 million as the second quarter of 2015 included only one-month of the Family Dollar performance. Gross profit for the Dollar Tree segment increased 9.2% for the quarter.","Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.3% during the second quarter, a 20 basis point improvement compared with the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Factors impacting the segment\u2019s gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs due to favorable freight costs and higher initial mark-on, partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales.","On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment increased $588.4 million. The increased amount was due to the nine additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 26.6% during the second quarter compared with 22.9% in the comparable prior year period.","Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $1.9 million in the current quarter and $11.1 million in the prior year\u2019s quarter, gross profit margin was 26.7% for this quarter compared with 23.3% in the prior year\u2019s full quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher mark-on, lower shrink and the prior year period being negatively impacted due to the $60 million of markdown expense related to SKU rationalization and plant liquidations.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 57.9% to $1.16 billion from $731.8 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. The majority of the $423.4 million increase related to $398.6 million of incremental Family Dollar expense.","Q2 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 23.3%, an 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. The prior year\u2019s quarter included $16.5 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding the prior year\u2019s acquisition-related costs, SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 10 basis points compared to the adjusted 23.4% of sales for the prior year\u2019s quarter.","The year-over-year decrease for the quarter was driven primarily by lower payroll costs as we implemented our shared-service model, lower incentive cost based on performance and reduced legal expenses. These were partially offset by higher store hourly payroll costs and store operating costs related to HVAC repair costs.","On a GAAP basis, SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment increased $398.7 million. The increased amount was due to nine additional weeks in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent of sales was 23% compared to 22.5% in the prior year\u2019s full quarter.","The current year includes $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation. The prior year\u2019s comparable period included $7.5 million of acquisition-related costs, $6.5 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $6.5 million for useful life and fixed asset revaluation.","Excluding these costs, SG&A expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to 21.8% from 21.7% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased store payroll, incentive compensation, advertising costs and repairs, partially offset by lower business insurance costs and lower utility costs.","Operating income for the combined organization increased to $357.2 million compared with $123.4 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 7.1% for the quarter from 4.1% in last year\u2019s second quarter. The increase included an incremental $189.7 million related to the additional nine weeks of operations for Family Dollar in the second quarter of 2016.","Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 110 basis points to 11% when compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding $16.5 million in acquisition-related costs from the prior year quarter, operating income for the Dollar Tree segment improved 30 basis points to 11% compared to 10.7% of sales in the prior year\u2019s second quarter.","On a GAAP basis, operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $189.7 million to 3.6%. Excluding the $1.9 million of inventory step-up amortization, $18.7 million for favorable lease rights amortization and the $5 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation, operating profit margin for Family Dollar in the quarter was 4.6%.","In the prior year, the Family Dollar segment incurred an operating loss, primarily as a result of markdowns related to SKU rationalization and planned liquidations of non-go-forward merchandise.","Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $87.3 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax expense rate for the second quarter was 36.9% compared to a tax benefit of 31.1% in prior year\u2019s quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to a pretax loss for the second quarter of 2015.","For the second quarter, the Company had net income of $170.2 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to the reported net loss of $98 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2015.","Our outstanding debt is approximately $7.3 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 15.1% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased to 10.4%. Inventory for selling square foot increased 4.3%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the third quarter.","Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 1.5% from the same period last year and increased 2.2% on a selling square foot basis. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the third quarter.","Capital expenditures were $180 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $100.1 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2016, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including few development stores, our re-banner initiatives, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects and our distribution center projects.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $161.9 million for the second quarter. This includes purchase accounting-related costs of $18.7 million for the favorable lease rights amortization and $5 million in depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $89.5 million in the second quarter of last year.","For fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for two items, which are included in our guidance.","First, it includes $30 million all in the first half of fiscal 2016 of depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable lives accounting policies of the two companies and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation.","Secondly, it includes $18.4 million for Q3 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases.","Our updated outlook for fiscal 2016 includes the following assumptions. Our same-store sales calculation excludes Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are re-bannered. The acquired stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations as of the beginning of our fourth quarter of 2016.","In 2016, the last two days of October, our biggest Halloween sales days, shift into our fourth quarter. We reflected this shift accordingly in our sales guidance. There are two additional days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2016.","We will continue to experience a higher than normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our re-banner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our re-banner strategy analysis and our outlook for same-store sales. We have budgeted lower diesel fuel and import freight costs than a year ago.","Interest expense will be approximately $88 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4. We are currently reviewing opportunities to refinance our current debt structure given market conditions in the debt capital markets. Our guidance does not include any effect of potential reduced interest expense or non-cash charges for deferred financing fees to be written off if a transaction is consummated. Any material changes would be communicated via an 8-K upon closing of a transaction.","Our updated full-year guidance now includes an estimated impact of $0.03 to $0.04 per share related to the FLSA change and over time regulations, which takes effect in December. Our guidance incorporates the costs and synergies from our corporate restructuring related to merger integration that was announced on August 4. We cannot predict the future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates.","Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 29.9% for the third quarter and 33.7% for fiscal 2016. The lower rate in Q3 is a result of the state of North Carolina lowering its corporate income tax rate from 4% to 3%, beginning January 1, 2017.","The Company estimates this change will decrease its deferred tax liability and decrease its tax expense. The Company expects to recognize a one-time tax benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.09 per share in Q3 of fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 236.4 million shares for Q3 and for the full-year.","For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.02 billion to $5.10 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.76 to $0.82, which includes the expected one-time tax benefit of $0.09 per share. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 2.5%.","For fiscal 2016, we are now forecasting total sales to range from $20.69 billion to $20.87 billion compared to the Company\u2019s previously expected range of $20.79 billion to $21.08 billion. The Company now anticipates net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis for full-year 2016 will range between $3.67 and $3.82. This compares to our previous EPS guidance range of $3.58 to $3.80. These estimates are based on low single-digit same-store sales increase and a 4% square footage growth.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Kevin. And again, I\u2019m pleased with our overall performance for the second quarter, and I\u2019m extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in a very short time. Just over a year since closing, we\u2019ve cleaned up the Family Dollar inventory and the stores.","The business has stabilized and is showing signs of long-term fundamental improvements. We have successfully launched and are testing the results of our first co-bannered DC in St. George, Utah, and we continue to make progress on our systems integration and development of our shared-services model for support functions. We have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year three and I believe we can exceed these expectations.","These synergies will be achieved through a combination of lowering costs in both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. But this is just the beginning. There\u2019s much more to do, and I will tell you that, as always, we will employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives.","We\u2019re confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of sales and earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history.","For 34 consecutive quarters, the Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. While our price point remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. Our history of performance continues in the second quarter, Dollar Tree banner sales increased 8.5%, same-store sales increased 1.2% and operating margin improved to 11%.","Over the past three weeks, I have attended and presented at our Family Dollar segment\u2019s Annual Leadership Conference and our Dollar Tree segment\u2019s Annual Field Management Meeting. I really like what I see. Our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. It\u2019s a great time to be Dollar Tree.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] As a remainder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We\u2019ll go first to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. On today\u2019s announcement from one of your competitors, it\u2019s noted that there\u2019s been some headwinds from food deflation and food stamp participation rate reductions and even some competitive pressures.","I wonder if you could frame that up with the Dollar Tree versus the Family Dollar segments. I assume Dollar Tree might be a little more sheltered from those. And if so, maybe perhaps talk about if you\u2019re seeing any impact on the Family Dollar segment regarding those dynamics?","Bob Sasser","Yes. Thanks for the question. We are a little more sheltered, I think, than the other segment. Our SNAP, our food stamp penetration, is fairly small to begin with, especially in the Family or the Dollar Tree segments. So it\u2019s less than 5%. So there has been some impact there on that food stamp and SNAP across the banner, but it really it is a small piece of our business at Dollar Tree. Gary, you have a comment on Family Dollar business?","Gary Philbin","Certainly, at Family Dollar, food stamp penetration runs higher than Dollar Tree. It\u2019s still under 5%, I would say, during the quarter. We were relatively flat, and with the exception of that last week in July, where we really lost first-of-month money, which is probably the only dip we saw in a particular week. Certainly, our customers at Family Dollar are still under pressure. They do respond. So for us, I frame it up - our opportunity is just being ready on first-of-month with our customer, and that\u2019s really our focus.","Peter Keith","Okay, thanks. And then maybe a follow-up on that. How should we think about the Family Dollar same-store sales growth once it enters the comp base in Q4? Do you think it\u2019s going to be accretive or dilutive or neutral?","Kevin Wampler","Yes, within our guidance that we\u2019ve given, it\u2019s basically neutral. It\u2019s the way we would plan it and the way it\u2019s built within the guidance. So - and again, it\u2019ll take effect in Q4, and it\u2019ll be more [indiscernible].","Peter Keith","Okay. Thanks a lot. Good luck for the rest of the year.","Kevin Wampler","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey, great thanks very much for taking my question. Good morning guys. Just to follow up on the Dollar Tree kind of comp reporting structure once 4Q comes around. Should we expect one consolidated number? And then what level of detail between the segments do you expect to give going forward?","Kevin Wampler","Yes. The expectation is there will be a consolidated number, but there will be indications for the segments as well. So I think it\u2019ll be the best way to get the benefit of both worlds, so to speak. So it is one company at the end of the day, one reporting entity, but obviously, we do segment report as well.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, thanks Kevin. Just one quick follow-up. I know in the press release you noted kind of continues to be a challenging sales environment. Can you give any specific commentary on have there been any changes more recently and in particular, as I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all asked on this call, kind of any notable change from Walmart, specifically?","Bob Sasser","Vincent, what we\u2019re looking at is it is a fairly challenging retail environment, really based on looking at the consumer. We still believe that consumer is under a lot of pressure. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about lower gas prices, which over the past year, I guess, lower, they seem to pop up and down here and there.","But the consumer is still seeing a lot of pressure on cost increase with rent and just food and health care and taxes and all the things. So we see them as still being under pressure. I think that\u2019s the number one issue that we see out there. Gary mentioned the calendar shift that put first-of-the-month money into the next quarter. That was an impact we saw in both banners, especially in the Family Dollar banner. In the Dollar Tree banner, we experienced a little more cannibalization than we typically do, so we called that out.","But basically, it\u2019s just mostly driven by the consumer. We are watching the competition. Retail is a very competitive as we all know, a competitive business. We watch what they do, and we react accordingly with prices or with - sometimes learning what they\u2019re doing, it helps us along the way, too. So we\u2019re looking at the competition. We\u2019re shopping our prices throughout the quarter. We shop full book at - once per quarter and the key items throughout the quarter. So we\u2019re keeping up with that. I can\u2019t tell you that that\u2019s been an issue anymore, though, for us than it usually is.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, great. Thanks very much Bob. Good luck going forward.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Joseph Feldman with Telsey Group.","Joseph Feldman","Hi, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask one quick question about that shift of August into the third quarter, like if you excluded that, would the Family Dollar comps been positive? Or it just would\u2019ve been a little less negative than\u2026","Bob Sasser","Well, we won\u2019t know because you can\u2019t really do it. But I think it would have been \u2013 it would have shifted it to that positive area. But you\u2019ll never know. It is a big deal in both banners, the first-of-the-month, that\u2019s why we talked about being first-of-the-month ready. It is especially a bigger \u2013 it\u2019s much bigger in the Family Dollar business, I believe, because of the more needs based. About 70-some percent is needs-based product in the Family Dollar. So when you shift that first and the third of the month when the money is out there for the lower income, the entitlements and all of that, then that does make a big difference.","Joseph Feldman","Got it. And then as far as the \u2013 some of the efforts on the Family Dollar side, I know \u2013 thank you for the update on where you are, but I guess, I was just kind of thinking, from a \u2013 maybe if you could share some in sort of a baseball metaphor or something like where you guys are on some of those various issues in terms of innings or like I know it\u2019s still early on a lot of it, but are some a little more middle innings versus haven\u2019t even begun the game?","Gary Philbin","Hey. Joseph, this is Gary. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a baseball game, so I\u2019m not sure I want to say the inning because I think what we\u2019re really playing down is a foundation of long-term growth. And for us, that\u2019s maybe more around how we think about the elements that we know we have to fix in the business. So the table stakes in my mind are the elements that our customers going to give us credit for in the long-term. So customer engagement in our stores, cleaner stores, in-stocks, those are some of the things we just have to do along with some of the facilities that had deferred maintenance.","So there\u2019s certainly those things that don\u2019t necessarily give you a credit on sales, but you just have to do. But our ability to really get our folks focused on really landing on those elements are most important. So maybe it\u2019s not a baseball game. Maybe it\u2019s polo and run the second chukker. I\u2019m not sure. So we have an opportunity here just to build the business based on the foundation of what is most important to our Family Dollar customer.","Those things are what our customers will give us credit for. It\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And so we\u2019re playing around on first-of-month, so when we talk about being first-of-month and weekend-ready, we\u2019ve got to improve and gain consistency with our customers that we have the items that are in-stock, what they need at a fair price. And that\u2019s really the architecture we\u2019re building Family Dollar around for long-term success.","Joseph Feldman","Got it. Thank you. And if I could just sneak one more before I leave. Consumables was a little softer than discretionary. I\u2019m curious as to was there anything behind that? It\u2019s different from what we hear from a lot of the other retailers.","Bob Sasser","Well, first of all, that shift to first-of-the-month, a lot of that is consumable products. So when we shifted that into the next quarter, I think that impacted it greatly. The other thing is we\u2019re having some really great seasonal and variety efforts in our Dollar Tree segment. The merchandise has just been terrific. The value in our variety merchandise continues to get better. When I pointed out that for 30 years, price has been $1, but our values are better and our margin and our initial mark-up continues to increase, that\u2019s true.","Our buyers are doing a terrific job in sourcing and then couple that along with some favorable freight rates, ocean freight and\/or transportation costs in the U.S. and we really are getting greater value in our variety merchandise, still at a $1 price point. And by the way it\u2019s a little higher margin. So I attribute it to terrific merchandising especially in the Dollar Tree variety segment.","Joseph Feldman","Great. Thanks. Good luck for this quarter guys.","Bob Sasser","Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Stan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel Binder","Hi, actually it\u2019s Dan Binder. My question was around Family Dollar as well, and you commented that the synergy goals maybe ultimately exceeded. I\u2019m just curious, as you\u2019re a year into this, where do you think the upside is going to be? Is it in vendor leverage? Is it in supply chain?","And then on the topic of pricing, obviously, you\u2019ve been calling out more value with smart ways to save program. I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re doing with pricing at Family Dollar more broadly across the store and how much you\u2019ve had to invest in pricing since you\u2019ve taken it over?","Bob Sasser","This is Bob. I\u2019ll let Gary speak to the Family Dollar. But to the synergies, we\u2019re very pleased with where we are on the synergies going forward. I think I\u2019ve said this before that I would be disappointed if we couldn\u2019t beat $300 million. I haven\u2019t quantified that, and I\u2019m not ready to do that right now, but we are well on track with that.","There is still terrific opportunities in our indirect spend. There\u2019s just more there to be done. There\u2019s a lot more to be done in our supply chain. That\u2019s a big cost, a big expense, and we\u2019re really \u2013 the supply chain team is really doing some great work right now. That requires technology support, technology integration and some other things to take a little longer. But the payback on the supply chains going to be very strong as we go forward. Gary, if you\u2019d like to...","Gary Philbin","Dan, here\u2019s on the pricing question. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it sort of science and the art of science is obviously knowing what the rest of the world is doing so we understand that very well monthly as we go through. I think the art of it and here\u2019s what\u2019s important for us at Family Dollar.","First of month is obviously very important for us. What I\u2019ve learned over my time there is the items that we have to be ready for on first of month and the value equation we have to have on end caps, that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on making sure our customer sees. One of our smart ways to save. It can be Dollar items. It can be private-brand items that are tied into our great value on a national brand end cap.","Our ability to have cleaned up end caps now gives us the opportunity to do some of those things we were not able to a year ago. Up and down the aisle, we want our customers to see a promise of great everyday low price. We want to make sure we\u2019re calling out our Dollar well. We\u2019ve added a couple hundred Dollar items over the past year, but this is not about converting a Family Dollar into Dollar Tree.","We have a great private-brand program that we\u2019re polishing up and enhancing. We want to make sure that on sale, we have the right national brand items and are at there driving traffic. So it\u2019s not just one tool we\u2019re using. We want to be certainly competitive as we measure the competition. But really, for our customers at Family Dollar, we have really get all those things together that we\u2019re describing in smart ways to save to execute very well around first of month, but then the balance of the month as well.","Our customer shops differently at the end of the month than the beginning of the month. And it\u2019s really something that I think is unique to Family Dollar, with a customer base we serve it. We\u2019re getting smarter on how they respond on both promotions and then what we show in store. So that\u2019s the work that we\u2019re working very hard to get smarter on and improve our sales trajectory on.","Daniel Binder","And just as a follow-up on the supply chain. Can you give us a little bit color on what that schedule looks like from an integration standpoint? I know you\u2019ve had this re-bannered DC up in St. George that\u2019s up and running. But just in terms of the rest of the integration activity, what\u2019s involved and how long that will take?","Gary Philbin","Yes. We\u2019re still working through a lot of that. Again, we\u2019ve got two WMS that both work really well. We are integrating those two, though. That\u2019s going to take some time. We\u2019re also looking at engineered standards and doing a lot of work, and especially in the Dollar Tree banner, as we bring these two companies together on engineered standards.","So a lot of foundational work is being done right now with 22 distribution centers. So the idea of planning for capacity needs as we\u2019re continuing to grow is a high priority. So we\u2019re spending time on what do we need going forward based on our growth, number one. And number two, the integration and how do we put these two banners together to better serve not only the new growth, but also the existing businesses.","So lots of things are going on with St. George it was the first one. It\u2019s only been a couple months, few months. I think June, I guess, is when we brought that up. And there\u2019s some refinements that they\u2019re in process of doing on that. But we have been able \u2013 we\u2019ve done the hard work of integrating and shipping both banners out of one distribution center. That gives us the ability going forward to take advantage of capacity and assist them no matter where it exists by using it for both banners.","It gives us the ability to reduce our stem miles in the future. So that we can deliver both banners out of the same DCs, then certainly, we can get the best stem miles. So there\u2019s a lot of payback there, but it is taking a little time on integration because of technology. We\u2019re continuing to grow, and we\u2019re not going to miss anything there. We still have to continue to provide capacity as we continue to grow.","And frankly, the engineered standards work that we\u2019re doing is really, really important to us as we go forward and combine these two banners and combine these two networks, doing it the most efficient way and reducing cost per building is a big idea. So we\u2019re working really hard on it. The time line is still a little bit in flux. I would tell you that we\u2019re going to - I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to beat our synergy estimates on the supply chain in the three years as we said. I can\u2019t tell you how much.","Daniel Binder","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for a couple more questions. We\u2019ll go next to Alan Rifkin with BTIG.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you very much. Bob, as a follow-up to the $300 million synergy goal that you expect to exceed, you had, in earlier calls, talked about year one synergies which we are now past being $75 million. Can you maybe provide some commentary relative to the $75 million as to what you realized in the first full year?","Bob Sasser","Yes. I would say we\u2019re hitting and exceeding expectations. There\u2019s a lot more to be done and more than, as I said early and also in earlier calls, that I\u2019d be disappointed if we couldn\u2019t exceed the $300 million. The work is being done right now. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity there.","As I said earlier in this call, the indirect spend is a huge opportunity for us as we get into all the things that we don\u2019t sell but that we use in the business and using the power of the combined companies to improve our buying and leverage on that is going to be a big extra. So I\u2019m excited about our goals and exceeding our goals, and we\u2019re on target.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. Fair enough. You also basically raised the midpoint of your earnings guidance by $0.05, $0.055 with the new guidance today, including the $0.03 to $0.04 impact from the overtime rule going into effect December 1. You did this at the same time that you lowered revenues and basically kept the comps consistent at low single digits.","How should we view the incremental increase to earnings? Is that coming from better performance at the core Dollar Tree chain? Is it coming from a result of greater synergies that you\u2019re expecting in the second half of the year or better performance at Family Dollar? If you could maybe just provide a little bit more color on the delta resulting in the higher earnings today?","Kevin Wampler","Sure, Alan. This is Kevin. And so a lot of moving pieces right now, as you\u2019re well aware. And we talked about the fact that there is a $0.09 onetime benefit in Q3 related to taxes. And so that\u2019s obviously a piece of it.","You\u2019re right. FLSA is now in the guidance, and so that\u2019s $0.04. We\u2019ve got some restructuring charges from our announcement from August 4 that are in there as well. But there are - the rest of it, I guess, I would tell you, there are some pluses and minuses, right? So we took obviously sales came down based upon trends.","We did say earlier this year that we expected the synergies to be more impactful in the second half of the year, so there is a piece of that. We are seeing both banners we talked today about the fact that we\u2019ve seen higher mark-on and lower transportation costs and probably a little bit better than what we had probably originally anticipated.","So - and again, I feel pretty good about the fact that even on a one comp, food basically leveraged our SG&A during the quarter. So again, we\u2019re keeping our mind and our eyes on the expenses and managing them well. So a lot of moving pieces. But I think that kind of gives you kind of the backdrop as to how we\u2019re thinking about it.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. Two questions, actually. First, Kevin, given the commentary regarding the overtime rules, is that the kind of figure we should just annualize? Or there\u2019s more to labor in 4Q, so you can\u2019t really think about that on an annualized basis, number one. And number two, given the timing of the purchase of Family Dollar last year and your historical kind of forward ordering pattern, should we expect to see more meaningful changes to the Family Dollar merchandise offering as we roll into 4Q? Thanks.","Kevin Wampler","I\u2019ll speak to the first. I\u2019ll let Gary speak to the second. But as far as FLSA, again, when we spoke to at last quarter, we said $0.03 to $0.04 and it was not included in our guidance. And again, the rules had really just come out the week prior to that, I want to say. We continue to believe $0.03 to $0.04 is the right number.","And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not \u2013 you don\u2019t just take that number and annualize it. December is by far the biggest affected period of time. It is the period of time when, as you can imagine, our stores are very, very busy, requires our managers to work a lot of hours. And we obviously, have to take that in consideration.","So obviously, we\u2019re testing some things right now in our stores as to how we\u2019ll address this. It is a bigger effect on a dollar basis in the Family Dollar banner than the Dollar Tree banner. The Family Dollar banner has historically been more of a full-time employee model versus the Dollar Tree model, which has been more part time staffing.","And so things there we\u2019ll be looking at, so you can\u2019t annualized it, and I think what we\u2019ll look to do is we\u2019ll learn, as we go through the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be able to give a better product indication as to what we really believe the full-year possibilities are after we get through the fourth quarter. But I wouldn\u2019t say annualization is the right way to go.","Gary Philbin","Scot, Gary. Let me just comment on the fourth quarter and what\u2019s ahead of us. We\u2019re excited about the fourth quarter, and so when we talk about the assortment changes, I mean, each year, we go through the line reviews. And of course, last year, Christmas had been bobbed, so we went into a holiday with what we had. I don\u2019t know how I would color major changes or not. I think we refined what our customers have the need for and also the wants for as we go into the fourth quarter.","I think we have a great opportunity at Family Dollar to really win the holiday. We just had our entire field team in to show off a product and assortment that\u2019s geared up really from October through Thanksgiving through Christmas.","So merchandising energy that we often had talked about in the past at Dollar Tree that translates pretty well into Family Dollar too. It\u2019s just that customers come to us for different reasons, and we\u2019re going to take full advantage of that at Family Dollar as we go into October, November, December. I think you\u2019ll see\u2026","Scot Ciccarelli","Gary, I know that you\u2019ve maintained separate ordering groups and merchandisers et cetera for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. But would you say that is it the third quarter or the fourth quarter? Or when would you say that you were kind of starting to see more of a consolidated effort in terms of how you\u2019re trying to merchandise in a little bit more, call it oversight on the Dollar Tree side?","Gary Philbin","On the Dollar Tree? I\u2019m not sure I follow.","Scot Ciccarelli","No, just in terms of like you\u2019re sitting in your seat, right, and you\u2019re going to have more impact and more influence regarding what\u2019s showing up in the stores. You\u2019ve obviously made some tweaks at the margin, but I would think that there\u2019s going to be more meaningful changes the longer you\u2019re kind of in that seat and you kind of reorganize how you want to merchandise the stores.","Gary Philbin","I\u2019m not sure I have a date for you, Scot, that you\u2019ll be able to go in and see a brand new story. It is a continual refinement of the assortment, test and learn. You\u2019re going to see things change over time by assortment and ultimately in the store. But I\u2019m not here to give you a date where you\u2019re going to see something that went from one assortment that dramatically changes to something else.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. Thanks guys.","Gary Philbin","You bet.","End of Q&A","Operator","At this time, I like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Guiler for any additional or closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Thanks, Melanie.

Good morning everyone. As we reported today, the turnaround of the Family Dollar business continues to gain momentum. Family Dollar\u2019s same store sales increase of 2.4% was the third consecutive quarter of sequential acceleration and represented 160 basis point improvement in the two-year stacked comp. Despite sales headwinds created by the global helium shortage, Dollar Tree\u2019s segment delivered a same stores sales increase of 2.4% while cycling a strong 3.7% increase from the prior year\u2019s quarter. Dollar Tree has now delivered 46 consecutive quarters of positive same store sales and eight consecutive quarters of two-year stacked comps exceeding 6%. ","I\u2019m proud of the team\u2019s accomplishments. During the quarter, we successfully consolidated our store support centers and as planned closed 296 Family Dollar stores as part of the store optimization efforts. Additionally, we completed 542 Family Dollar renovations into the H2 format. ","Our results for the second quarter included a sales increase of 3.9% to $5.74 billion. Consolidated same store sales increased 2.4%. Our GAAP EPS of $0.76 exceeded our $0.64 to $0.73 per share guidance range. Other highlights for the quarter included completing 542 Family Dollar H2 renovations, completing 275 Dollar Tree Snack Zones, repurchasing $88.4 million of shares during the quarter as part of our share buyback program. ","At the end of July we formally moved all business to the Chesapeake, Virginia campus. This represented the work over the past year to bring all functions, and especially our merchant teams, together. While we still have associates in the moving process, we now have one physical location to conduct our business.","Regarding Dollar Tree sales highlights for the second quarter, Dollar Tree had increases in both traffic and ticket with traffic slightly outpacing the ticket increase. Geographically, all regions comped positively. Cadence of comps through the quarter, all three months were better than 1.5% with June being the strongest month. Dollar Tree continued to deliver solid positive comps in the consumables category. Our discretionary business also comped positive but was impacted by the global helium shortage. We estimate that our comp was negatively impacted from lost balloon sales by approximately 40 basis points. We expect this helium shortage headwind to continue but to a lesser degree in the back half of the year. The first half is more impacted with the timing of our biggest balloon holidays - Valentine\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s Day, as well as school graduations. ","For real estate in the second quarter for both segments, we opened a total of 150 new stores, 107 Dollar Trees and 43 Family Dollars. We relocated or expanded 17 Dollar Tree and two Family Dollar stores, we renovated 542 Family Dollar stores as part of our H2 renovation initiative, and we re-bannered 106 Family Dollars to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 817 projects during the quarter. We also added freezers and coolers into 210 Dollar Tree stores during the second quarter, bringing our total of Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 5,970. ","During the quarter, we closed 305 stores, nine Dollar Trees, and consistent with our previously announced efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio, 296 Family Dollar stores. We ended the quarter with 15,115 stores, split into 7,306 Dollar Tree stores and 7,809 Family Dollars.","Last week, we opened up our 24th U.S. distribution center located in Marlow County, Ohio on time, on budget. The 1.2 million square foot facility is creating approximately 400 jobs in central Ohio and will initially be serving Dollar Tree stores. It is equipped with the necessary systems to serve both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments in the future. I would call out the partnership and support we received from the State of Ohio, Marlow County, and the surrounding communities has been just outstanding.","Before I turn the call over to Duncan to discuss the Family Dollar business, I\u2019d like to provide you all an update on tariffs.","We have been operating in unique times, to say the least, as it relates to tariffs. As I stated one quarter ago, our merchandising teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating the effects of 25% tariffs imposed under Section 301 for Chinese goods included on Lists 1, 2 and 3. Prior to the recent USTR announcements on List 4, as well as the additional 5% tariff increase on all lists, we believe our team had successfully mitigated most of the adverse effects of the Section 301 tariffs. We have negotiated price concessions, cancelled orders, modified specs, evolved product mix, and diversified vendors. We are now taking actions to mitigate the recently announced tariff increases and will continue to assess the future impact of those tariffs.","Our merchandising team is experienced, committed and talented. They have developed a tested and proven process for mitigating costs and have the metrics in place to track and measure success. The team will continue to focus on delivering great values to our customers while managing and protecting margins.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Duncan.","Duncan Mac Naughton","Thank you Gary, and good morning everyone. Before I discuss Family Dollar\u2019s performance, I\u2019d like to share details regarding a significant organizational milestone that we recently achieved.","Effective July 22, we have successfully consolidated our store support centers into Chesapeake, Virginia. This was a large, complex task that required effective communication, collaboration, and teamwork throughout the organization. I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s attitude, commitment and determination throughout this process. Many of our associates stepped up to relocate with the organization and are now settling into the southeast Virginia area. I\u2019d also like to salute and recognize those who could not or chose not to relocate, but they stayed on through July to facilitate a smooth transition. ","The benefits of having our brands together in one location are simply immeasurable. The Family Dollar team is already seeing the benefits from the stability of having a clear vision of the direction and future of our company. ","The Family Dollar team delivered another quarter of sequential improvement and comps with a 2.4% increase. The team\u2019s performance demonstrates that our efforts to improve the consistency of execution across our stores and our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio are working and gaining traction. We continue to believe that we\u2019re making the right steps to transform our customer experience to increase the frequency of their visits. ","Regarding Family Dollar sales highlights for the second quarter, an increase in average ticket drove the same store sales increase in the quarter as year-over-year transaction count was essentially flat. Our consumable business performed very well, delivering its 11th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales.","Regarding the cadence of comps during the quarter, May was up against the strongest compare from a year ago and was slightly positive. June and July were the strongest months of the quarter, and notably year-over-year traffic turned positive. From a regional perspective, comps for all seven zones were better than 1% with the strongest performance in the west, southeast, and southwest.","A few weeks, ago, we conducted Family Dollar\u2019s annual leadership conference. This conference brings together our field leadership team and business leaders to teach, to learn, to network and strategize as we prepare for the very important holiday season. The field leadership teams are energized and focused, and they will take that energy back to their respective store teams. ","The theme of our 2019 meeting was the Road to Reinvention. We must evolve to be prepared for the future and we\u2019re making smart changes and bold changes in our business at Family Dollar. As demonstrated by three consecutive quarters of improved comps, our customers are giving us credit for the improvements they\u2019re seeing in our stores, which include our H2 renovations which continue to deliver low double-digit lift, and our grand reopening events are effectively getting the word out to the local communities. Key components of the H2 renovations are $1 Dollar Stop or $1 Wow sections throughout the whole store; more freezer and cooler doors with a broader selection of products; new signage, new d\u00e9cor with improved queuing lines at checkout; better lighting, and much, much more. ","Our category resets are working. We\u2019re seeing material comp lifts post-reset. Examples of our reset success include candy, household products, and food storage. I\u2019m very proud of the work the teams have done on our private brand offerings with improved labels and packaging. These national brand equivalent, value priced products represent an opportunity to deliver great values to our customers while driving customer loyalty, store traffic, and profit dollars.","At Family Dollar, we are on the road to reinvention. The team has delivered positive comps of 1.4%, 1.9% and 2.4% over the past three quarters, and I am pleased with the additional trends for the third quarter. We have the headquarter move behind us, we have an eager, energized and aligned leadership team, and a terrific plan entering the holiday season. I look forward to providing you more updates on our progress in the quarters ahead.","I will now turn to Kevin to provide more detail on our second quarter performance and our updated outlook for 2019.","Kevin Wampler","Thanks Duncan, and good morning. Total sales for the second quarter increased 3.9% to $5.74 billion, comprised of $2.96 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.78 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same store sales increased 2.4% and on a segment basis, same store sales for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar increased 2.4%. Overall, gross profit was $1.65 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year\u2019s quarter.","As a percent of sales, gross margin was 28.7% compared to 30.1% in Q2 of 2018. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 70 basis points to 33.8% when compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. Factors impacting the segment\u2019s gross margin performance for the quarter included merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 55 basis points primarily due to higher domestic outbound freight costs and an increase in the mix of lower margin consumables sold. Distribution costs increased approximately 10 basis points due to higher payroll costs, and occupancy costs increased approximately 5 basis points on the lower comp compared to the prior year.","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 23.3% during the second quarter compared to 25.7% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to the following. Markdown expense increased approximately 100 basis points, resulting from store closure, re-banner and renovation markdowns as anticipated as part of our store optimization process. Merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 95 basis points, primarily due to increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise and slightly higher freight costs. Shrink increased approximately 45 basis points resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the current quarter and from changes to the accrual rate.","Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales in the quarter increased 80 basis points to 24% from 23.2% in the same quarter last year. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales improved to 22.5% compared to 22.6% for the second quarter of 2018. The improvement was due to the following. Store operating costs were lower by approximately 15 basis points due to lower utility costs, specifically electricity resulting primarily from the benefit of the LED lighting program in the stores. Payroll costs increased approximately 10 basis points primarily due to an increase in store hourly payroll due to higher average hourly rate, partially offset by lower retirement plan expenses. ","SG&A expenses for the Family Dollar segment were 22.7% as a percentage of sales in the second quarter compared to 21.6% for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to the net of the following. Operating and corporate expenses increased approximately 95 basis points, resulting primarily from the loss on disposal of fixed assets due to the store closure write-offs and store supplies expense to support the H2 initiative. Payroll expenses increased approximately 35 basis points primarily due to average hourly rate increases and additional hours, including temporary help expense to support H2 renovations. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 15 basis points as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated or amortized. ","Corporate support expenses increased 30 basis points as a result of $10.8 million of store support center consolidation costs and higher depreciation. ","On a consolidated basis, operating income was $268.9 million compared with $382.5 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin was 4.7% of sales compared to 6.9% of sales in last year\u2019s second quarter. ","Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $40.5 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. ","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% compared to 18.9% in the prior year second quarter. The quarter and prior year quarter benefited by $5.8 million and $8.1 million respectively from a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions resulting from statute expirations. ","For the second quarter, the company had net income of $180.3 million or $0.76 per diluted shared. This compared to net income of $273.9 million or $1.15 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $623.4 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Our outstanding debt as of August 3, 2019 was $4.3 billion.","During the second quarter, we invested $88.4 million in the repurchase of approximately 882,000 shares. At quarter end, we had $812 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We will provide on additional share repurchases, if any, following the quarter in which they occur.","Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 15.1% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7.1%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 7.4%. Our inventory levels reflect the early receipt of imports to mitigate tariffs. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings, re-banners, and our sales initiatives for the back half of the year. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 2.3% from the same period last year and increased 3% on a selling square foot basis. ","Capital expenditures were $293.3 million in the second quarter versus $213.4 million in the second quarter last year. For fiscal 2019, we\u2019re planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion, which is consistent with our initial 2019 outlook. ","Depreciation and amortization totaled $155.1 million for the second quarter and $152.5 million in the second quarter of last year. For fiscal 2019, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million.","Our updated outlook for fiscal 2019 includes the following assumptions. Calendar considerations for the remainder of the year include the following. There will be six fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will negatively impact Q4 sales. With regard to tariffs and the recent USTR announcements, we estimate that without mitigation, List 4a and the additional 5% tariffs on Lists 1, 2 and 3 would cost the company approximately $26 million in additional tariffs. Our updated outlook does not include the recently announced tariff increases as we are currently working to mitigate these costs.","Our company outlook on March 6 of 2019 included $95 million in discrete costs related to our Family Dollar store optimization initiative and our store support center consolidation. With the increased visibility of our overall costs, we now expect to incur $85 million in discrete costs for the year, of which we\u2019ve incurred $76 million in the first half of the year. Our Q3 outlook includes the remaining estimated $9 million in costs related to these initiatives.","We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wage, and completing the company\u2019s initiative plans. We expect year-over-year domestic freight costs as a percentage of sales to flatten out in the second half while import freight rates, as we noted in last quarter\u2019s call, will increase in the back half of the year. ","Net interest expense will be approximately $41.1 million in Q3 and approximately $162.7 million for fiscal 2019. ","We cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we have not adjusted our outlook for currency rate changes. As always, our outlook assumes no additional share repurchases. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.4% for the third quarter and 22.1% for fiscal 2019.","Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.5 million shares for Q3 and 237.6 million shares for the full year. ","For the third quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.66 billion to $5.77 billion, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.16. These estimates are based on a low single digit increase in same store sales and include approximately $9 million of discrete costs. ","For fiscal 2019, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $23.57 billion and $23.79 billion based on a low single digit same stores increase and approximately 1.3% square footage growth. The company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for full year fiscal 2019 will range between $4.90 and $5.11, which includes discrete costs of $85 million or $0.28 per share and approximately $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share in store closure related costs.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Philbin","Thank you Kevin. I\u2019ll share a brief update on our early reads from the Dollar Tree Plus test. We are in the very early stages of our multi-price point test at select Dollar Tree stores and will continue to closely monitor the results, including impacts to traffic, sales and margins. Some details related to the test are: launched in mid-May. By the end of June, we had the test rolled out to approximately 115 stores. The test includes newly added products at price points of $2, $3, $4, and $5. The products being tested, which currently include about 200 SKUs, are clearly identified as Dollar Tree Plus items, providing customers more choices, more sizes, more savings. We are testing a cross-section of high, moderate, and low volume stores, as well as urban, suburban and rural settings so we can understand how customers respond in the varying markets. ","Early in the test, the product mix has leaned more towards consumables, and this will evolve as we move towards the holiday season with more discretionary items added to the test. We\u2019ve received feedback on the values from our customers on the initial merchandise assortment, and this is critical as we know we want to protect the Dollar Tree brand. Our customers view Dollar Tree as the destination for terrific value for what you spend in one dollar.","We are pleased with how our teams have started and implemented the test across varied geographies, store volumes, and size. It\u2019s giving us valuable insight to how our customers view these values across a Dollar Tree store. Our teams are excited about the evolution of the merchandise assortment as we approach the holiday season. On our most recent import trip, we have bought specifically for Dollar Tree Plus stores and are getting excited about the additional assortment that will resonate with our customers as we go into our holidays.","Finally, I wanted to share a few words regarding our field leadership meetings that I attended in the past few weeks for both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. This is the opportunity to connect with field leaders face to face, teach and learn, recognize and reward all those individuals and teams for performance and service awards. We interact with buyers and sellers. The merchants and our field team work together. We coach and mentor people development and ensure that we are all aligned heading into the important holiday season. We had very productive meetings, and I\u2019m pleased with the focus and business acumen of our businessmen and women that are leading our field organizations. Our leaders are energetic, focused and motivated going into this important back half. ","Operator, we\u2019re now ready to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We will take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about some of the improvement in the Family Dollar comp, to what extent you can tie it to initiatives versus underperforming stores coming out of the comp base versus macro strength, and do you think that we\u2019ve turned corner here on a higher run rate? I mean, it\u2019s been a few quarters now of improved sales.","Duncan Mac Naughton","Yes, good morning and thanks. I\u2019ll tell you what, we\u2019re pretty excited about the 2.4 comp at Family Dollar. What\u2019s most exciting, to your question, is all boats are rising. We\u2019re seeing great performance in our H2 stores. To me, what we\u2019re seeing is the bulk of the stores are also driving great comp sales, and as I talked about on my prepared remarks, we\u2019re now seeing positive traffic across the chain, so that\u2019s telling us our customers are liking what we\u2019re doing as we clean up our stores. ","As you know, we have roughly 1,000 H2 stores out there, and we closed the quarter with 7,809, so the good news here is we have multi years to add, as we\u2019re going to talk about, 1,150 or so stores this year, and how do we really change the face of our chain. I would tell you that we can\u2019t--with that small store base, we can\u2019t run the whole comp, so we\u2019re seeing the balance of the chain really help there. We did have some help from store closures, but it was not nearly as impactful as the balance of the chain.","Simeon Gutman","Then a follow-up, I guess on margin and the visibility, at what point does the margin improve and follow this top line? Related to it, can you just share with us on the Dollar Tree side how much helium may have hurt the GM and maybe the EBIT for the Dollar Tree business this quarter? ","Kevin Wampler","As we look at the margins and we look to the back half, obviously the front half in particular was loaded with the discrete costs - as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve incurred about $76 million of what we now believe is $85 million of costs that we will incur. We look for the gross margin to become much more comparable to last year, it\u2019s obviously been down. I think the one thing that we have to always consider as we\u2019ve been driving our business in the Family Dollar world with consumables, and even in Q2 the Dollar Tree business was driven by consumables based upon everything we have going on, touching all these stores that we\u2019re touching, so we\u2019re driving traffic, we\u2019re getting our core customer back into the store in Family Dollar, and they\u2019re liking what they\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s a little bit more consumable driven, so our job that we still have ahead of us is to continue to improve our discretionary business. We do look for the gross margin on the Family Dollar side to start to level out as we go through the back half.","Gary Philbin","Simeon, this is Gary. Let me add my color to that. For both banners, I think it\u2019s important as we went into this year, knowing all the stores are going to be torn up for renovations, H2 at Family Dollar, Snack Zones, at Dollar Tree, by the time we were going to get to Q2, we will have touched 1,000-plus stores. By design, not exactly reading the crystal ball as well as you would like, we went in aggressively - close-outs, our Wow product at the Dollar Tree side, a little bit more on consumable side, on the merchandise playing at Family Dollar, so part of that was to make sure we could through, touch these stores, catch them, put them back together, and still drive a positive comp.","As far as balloons, the impact there was the impact of 40 BPs, and that\u2019s really just on what we lost on balloon sales in the first half--or in the second quarter year-over-year. Obviously first half, as I called out, is a little more impactful. What we didn\u2019t measure was balloon sales usually have a halo effect of everything else in the party department, which is obviously one of our highest margin and a very large business, and it really drives customers to that store. We know it\u2019s not going to be as impactful because the holidays aren\u2019t as big, and we\u2019d like to think it\u2019s going to get moderately better as we go into \u201920, but that was probably the best way to measure the balloon impact.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. ","Matthew Boss","Thanks, and nice progress, guys. First at Family Dollar, how best to think about sequential same store sales improvement opportunity in the back half of the year? Maybe what do you see as top drivers of the traffic inflection at your H2 remodels, and any color on early 3Q trends would be helpful.","Duncan Mac Naughton","I\u2019ll tell you what, Matt - thanks for the question. As you can see, our engine is growing, our traffic is turning positive, and we\u2019re driving some real growth with consumables, and our job is to convert that to the discretionary side of the store to enhance our margin throughout the year. We\u2019ve got a really strong back half plan and a strong holiday plan that we just shared with our leaders at the annual leadership conference, and I think year-over-year you\u2019re going to see us continue to strive to grow our comps as we get more H2s on the ground, they mature, and we\u2019re seeing in the balance of the stores is they\u2019re really starting to have higher standards at store level, so the stores are getting cleaned up, the customer is noticing, and they\u2019re getting the components of some of the H2 stores while they may not be an H2 store. So we\u2019re trying to fast adapt as we learn what are the key winners and key categories.","We did a number of resets last year that are now going to start cycling and be helpful to the comp in the back half, so I feel pretty good about our business plan with comps as we look forward. ","Gary Philbin","Matt, it\u2019s Gary. I would just add, that\u2019s part of the energy and why we added more H2s. A shout-out to our openers has gotten us ahead of the game to this point to get the 1,000 done by the time we finish up August here, Labor Day weekend, and we had some more runway so we\u2019re up for another 150 to get done mainly through September, a little bit probably into October to give us more H2s on the ground. But to give credit to the Family Dollar team, the consistency of what we\u2019re seeing in stores, the work we\u2019ve done on key resets, I think what we see is lifting all boats right now. ","Matthew Boss","Great. Then as a follow-up, just to help break down margins, could you bucket the discrete the costs at Family Dollar between the gross margin and the SG&A, both what you saw in the second quarter, how to think about the back half, and larger picture what\u2019s the best way to think about Family Dollar\u2019s fundamental gross margin recapture opportunity that you see from here?","Kevin Wampler","Hey Matt, it\u2019s Kevin. In my prepared remarks, I tried to give some good color on this, so let\u2019s break it down into pieces here if we can. Obviously within the press release, we talked about $48 million of discrete costs within the quarter as well as $15 million of store closure costs, so that\u2019s a total of $63 million or about 230 basis points. If you take out the $10 million of store consolidation expenses, that means about $52 million sat within the Family Dollar segment, and as we called out within the prepared remarks, that\u2019s about 190 BPs. That basically broke down really about 100 BPs of markdowns, which we talked about, so you\u2019re talking about all the store closures, all the renovations, all the re-banners, everything related around that from that piece. Then on the SG&A side of it, it\u2019s all of the asset write-off for all the store closures. Again, we closed 296 stores during the quarter, supplies for the H2 renovations as well as labor, temp labor for the H2 renovations as well, so that\u2019s roughly 90, 95 BPs. That\u2019s kind of how to bucket-ize them the best way and the big picture way.","As far as a go-forward margin, we have huge opportunities. Obviously it\u2019s been a disappointing year from shrink perspective, and we have a lot of opportunity go forward. As we talked about last quarter, look for it to start to flatten out in the back half on a comparative basis. A lot of initiatives in process there relating to, one, just changes in leadership and structure, really working on our commitment to training, execution of our policies and procedures, defensive merchandising initiatives, analytics, and again getting our inventory levels down as well will be very, very helpful in that regard. So I think we have a huge opportunity as we go into next year to help our gross margin in that regard.","Gary Philbin","Matt, let me just chime in because I think--just a couple call-outs when I think about it. First off, with increased traffic we can steer this boat, and that\u2019s what the H2s are doing and what we\u2019re starting to see better in the rest of the fleet, and so an opportunity when somebody comes through the store and selling the compelling merchandise on the discretionary side becomes all the easier. Secondly, I\u2019ve got to just tell you, having everybody in the same building now and the merchant teams on the same floor, vendors now meeting both banners at the same time, I can\u2019t tell you how excited I am about that. We are a $25 billion company with a face to the vendor community. We can drive sales, and we\u2019ll be on the short list of people to come to, to do that.","Finally, just a continued piece on imports, forgetting tariffs for a second if we can, the opportunity to design and create value merchandise that sells at both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree is a big, big impact for us as we look forward. ","Operator","Once again, if you find your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star followed by two.","We\u2019ll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. ","Chuck Grom","Thanks, good morning. Duncan, I was wondering if you could amplify on the improvement in traffic in the quarter. Do you think it\u2019s new customers that you\u2019re gaining, or is it existing customers repeating? Then one for Kevin, just a follow-up on Matt\u2019s question because there\u2019s been a lot of confusion on the gross margin line in Family Dollar. I was wondering if I could ask it from a different way. Can you look at the one-time costs, both the discrete and the store closures, what that was from a basis point impact versus the normal course of business, i.e. shrink and any markdown activity? Thanks.","Duncan Mac Naughton","Thanks Chuck. As for Family Dollar traffic, I will tell you, as we talked about low double digit lifts in our H2 stores, about two-thirds of that is coming from traffic, so we\u2019re seeing transactions go up there and we\u2019re seeing a lot of repeat purchases coming. Part of that as we study the marketplace, we know we\u2019re acquiring some new customers from some other folks in the marketplace, so I will tell you that part of it is both our existing customer coming back more often and then getting and acquiring new customers that may have been a Family Dollar customer, and through our grand reopening initiative, as we communicate back to them that we\u2019ve got a new Family Dollar for you, why don\u2019t you come check it out, and they see what we have to offer and where they may have stopped shopping with us, they come back to us. We feel real good about that pattern, so.","In the balance of the chain, we\u2019re seeing--I think people are seeing that our store standards have been better and they\u2019re seeing that we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive with our growth in consumables, and we\u2019re working on the discretionary side of the business as Gary talked about, to move that customer over.","We\u2019ve also modified our marketing campaign to have more frequency so that we can be in the marketplace more often, which I\u2019m excited about because we\u2019ve got a gap there before, so that will close that gap. I would tell you that in the H2s, it\u2019s some new customers and the rest of the chain, it\u2019s both. I think the good news is trips are going up.","Kevin Wampler","Chuck, in regards to your question relating to the Family Dollar margin, again it\u2019s really three buckets related to the change year-over-year for the quarter. Again, it was 100 basis points from markdowns related to the initiatives, about 95 basis points related to increased sales of lower margin goods, a slightly higher freight, and then about 45 basis points related to shrink. It\u2019s really kind of the three buckets as we\u2019ve put them in and can best describe for you. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something beyond that that you\u2019re looking for?","Chuck Grom","No, that\u2019s helpful. I just wanted to get all the information. Then on the Tree, just maybe unpack for us the difference between the first and the second quarter gross margin performance and how you\u2019re thinking about it in the back half of the year. Thanks.","Kevin Wampler","I think if you look at the first quarter, gross profit was roughly flat year over year versus this quarter, so we were impacted more by freight in this quarter than we were the first quarter. Again, a little bit of timing, a little bit of what we\u2019ve got going on. Again, we did build inventory as well during the quarter from an import standpoint to mitigate tariffs, so there\u2019s some effect from that a little bit, but overall as we look at it, I think the idea of freight was the bigger piece.","We do look for that to mitigate a little bit as we go through the back half, as we\u2019ve said. Then the other piece as we\u2019ve called out was really the idea that we did sell--we had a better consumable business in the second quarter, so our sales mix, our margin mix averaged a little lower at the end of the day because of the overall consumables mix. As we go forward, I don\u2019t know--as I said, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019d necessarily expect to see the same type of pressure that we saw in Q2.","Gary Philbin","Chuck, I would just give you some color. I think really the last two years, our seasons have gotten out the gates very quickly and performed very well. All this inventory we brought in to beat the tariffs is there - that\u2019s the imports, it\u2019s higher margin. As we kick off really the fall harvest season as we get past Labor Day, to me we are set up to take advantage of what Dollar Tree does best, and that\u2019s getting geared up on the discretionary side of the business. We\u2019ve invested in consumables to make sure we had the kind of traffic and customer count we needed as we went through all of our Snack Zones. Snack Zones are delivering what we thought across the network, and now let\u2019s shift gears a little bit back to what the best time of the year is for Dollar Tree, and that\u2019s really September, October on through the Christmas holiday. ","Operator","Once again, if you would please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up if needed. ","We will take our next question from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse.","Judah Frommer","Thanks for taking my question. First to circle back to tariffs, it sounds like you\u2019ve quantified the potential impact from the increase on Lists 1 through 3 and List 4a, but it\u2019s not embedded in the 2019 guide. Is the messaging that you do feel you can fully offset that, or is the message that you\u2019re working to offset and you\u2019ll update us with the magnitude of offset at some point?","Gary Philbin","Thanks Judah. Yes is the short answer. Listen, we\u2019re six days from the last change, so here\u2019s how we\u2019ve gone through the year. The merchant teams had mitigated Lists 1, 2 and 3, as we knew it, then when List 4a, 4b first came out we had plans on that, and actually on our trip to Asia felt very good about where we were on that. Then of course, the most recent changes make that the call out of our most recent new.","Well, the things we\u2019re doing are working pretty darn well. I would say the vendor community is stepping up. We have done things like we\u2019ve said before, we can--we\u2019ve really worked hard on changing how we\u2019re packing things or the packaging, and how many units can we get on containers so we can land the overall cost lower. We\u2019ve been able to move, I would say modestly, $100 million on some of the buying trips out of China with our strategy of China-plus-1. I give credit to our merchants - this is about negotiating a vendor at a time to make those differences, and that\u2019s why I went into this call. We wanted to give you the math to give you some sense of the scale, and really while it\u2019s work we\u2019ve got to do from six days ago, I have confidence in the group that we\u2019ll mitigate it for the balance of the year.","Judah Frommer","Okay, great. Kevin, you were kind enough with Q4 earnings to give us an early read on next year and the earnings growth related to that. I think you\u2019ve been clear that you guys guide on a GAAP basis, but GAAP earnings have moved around quarter to quarter as discrete costs come and go. Is there any directional update you can give us on how you\u2019re thinking about that earnings growth trajectory for next year?","Kevin Wampler","We haven\u2019t updated the guidance we gave back in March on that subject. Obviously we\u2019re just kicking off our budget season right now as we speak, basically for next year, and I don\u2019t think--in the simplest terms, I don\u2019t think anything in the base has changed. I think we have the unknown of tariffs and where they go and what they may do. I don\u2019t know that any of us have an answer for that at this point in time. We\u2019ll have to take that into consideration accordingly. But I would tell you, the base case, I don\u2019t see necessarily a change in our thought process.","Judah Frommer","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Feldman with the Telsey Group.","Joe Feldman","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask, with regard to the new front end that you have at the Family Dollar side of the business, how many stores have that at this point, and how fast can you get that to all the stores? ","Duncan Mac Naughton","Hey Joe, thanks for the question, this is Duncan. We\u2019ve got it obviously in all H2 stores and we\u2019re putting it in all our new stores as well. The key constraint at store level is the size first and the width second. We do have multiple formats of the queuing line, so I will tell you that where we can, we\u2019re putting it in because it is very profitable to the store, not only the single serve beverages that are there but then again that front end is quite profitable both on the snack side, as well as you\u2019ve probably noticed we\u2019ve been putting discretionary items on there. The team right now is testing another front queuing line that will actually enhance profitability for that front end and really fit the needs of our customer, I think, better. It\u2019s primarily an H2 initiative at this point, is where we\u2019re focused. Where we\u2019re doing any other kind of renovations, we\u2019ll see if it can be accommodated, but it\u2019s really the H2 number.","Joe Feldman","Got it, thanks. Then also, just a question on the DCs. I know you guys just opened a 24th new DC, and you made a comment that it\u2019s set up for both but you\u2019re only going to start with the Dollar Tree. Can you remind us where you\u2019re at with how many co-branded DCs that you do have at this point, and how many you want to have?","Gary Philbin","Well, we have one DC that is in Utah that distributes to both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. We now have four additional DCs that have the internal workings and warehouse management system that allows us to deliver to both. We\u2019ve needed the capacity for the Dollar Tree banner because we have capacity in the Family Dollar network because of the closures, the re-banners, and of course that\u2019s putting pressure on the Dollar Tree banner. Ultimately, it comes down to the size of the building, any new building that we\u2019ve done comes now with the ability to deliver either banner, which will be a place that we move to and that\u2019s a stem mile opportunity for us in the out years. It\u2019s right now a function of capacity needed for our Dollar Tree banner to make sure we can service those stores, and we pick up obviously some stem miles every time we open up a Dollar Tree banner because we have more stores closer to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","Two quick things. I know there\u2019s not a lot of H2s with a lengthy history, but do you guys have a sense of how that format will mature and waterfall in years two and three, comp-wise? Do you think it\u2019s above maybe what a new store would do, a normal new store that settles into a more normal waterfall?","Duncan Mac Naughton","Hey John, it\u2019s Duncan. Thanks for the question. I think it\u2019d probably comp like a regular new store, is what we\u2019re thinking about, and we\u2019ve got a handful of them that have kind of cycled themselves, so we\u2019re learning quickly. But it\u2019s behaving like a new store.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Then maybe for Gary, again I know that multi price point is in its early stages here, but have you found anything interesting when you look at the basket construct of people who have a Dollar Tree Plus item in there versus those who don\u2019t? Are there fewer items when they buy a Dollar Tree Plus? How is it different?","Gary Philbin","Thanks John. I would say at this point, it\u2019s purely additive to the basket. It\u2019s telling us I\u2019m a Dollar Tree shopper, I come in, I like my regular items and now here is something that surprised me, is some of the feedback we hear. That goes into what was, quote-unquote, their regular basket. I think we\u2019ve started off with some items that are giving us some pretty good information how our customer views it, but what I\u2019m really maybe most excited about is putting a bit more of the Dollar Tree whimsy and surprise of the Wow effect into some of the items, and that will give us another very into what customers are buying, especially as we get around holiday time. So more to come - we\u2019ve bought specifically for these stores, and they\u2019ll be in addition to the assortment as we continue to evolve and get the best read we can.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","We have time for a few more questions. Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. You commented that you were pleased with 3Q trends at Family Dollar, so I just want to clarify, is that to be interpreted that comps are above where you came in, in 2Q? Then I had another clarification on guidance.","Kevin Wampler","Duncan made that comment. Obviously we\u2019re only three weeks in, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to give a whole lot of other information, but we\u2019re pleased, is what we would state. We\u2019re not going to make a statement whether it\u2019s higher or lower or what it might be, but we\u2019re very pleased at this point.","Karen Short","Okay, and then just with respect to guidance--not guidance, but I guess loose commentary on 2020, there\u2019s just a little confusion with respect to the comments you made in March. I\u2019m asking this question excluding tariffs, but when you think about that 14% to 18%, are you looking at a number that\u2019s based on GAAP EPS or adjusted EPS?","Kevin Wampler","We\u2019ve always said it\u2019s based upon GAAP EPS.","Karen Short","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly Bania","Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting me into the questions. Just wanted to ask about tariffs. It was helpful to have the quantification, I guess, of the $26 million over the next couple of months. I\u2019m guessing in terms of List 4 that you\u2019re still working through that, which is why that wasn\u2019t quantified, but maybe you can just talk about order of magnitude, how that would compare to what you\u2019re quantifying today, if you can at all? I guess a couple of other questions related to that - how much have you saved with respect to tariffs by bringing inventory early at multiple points throughout this year, and then is there at all an upper limit to what you think your team can offset here? Do you feel confident that as even as you get into next year, that this can further be mitigated? Thank you.","Gary Philbin","Hi Kelly. Listen, we\u2019re managing to what we know, let\u2019s start there. I think what we tried to paint a picture of, the magnitude for this 4a when we knew it was initially 10%, that was in our sights and the team went to work right away on 4a knowing that 4b was coming. We had more time on 4b. Once the tariff was increased for both List 4 and Lists 1, 2 and 3, we just are continuing to do the same playbook that\u2019s been working for us, everything that I had called out before. You know, we\u2019re in unique times, and we\u2019re in unique times where I think the opportunity is, I would tell you our vendor community is both--wants to work through this and help at this moment in time, and part of it is they\u2019re also concerned they might lose business, and some have as we have found other opportunities either inside China or outside China. There is never just one tune you play to overcome this.","What gives me confidence for the balance of this year is I can see the rocks in front of me, and our teams have worked real hard to overcome what we see this year. ","To a comment on \u201920, shoot, I\u2019m trying to think about what might happen this week or next week. But we are working real hard on what we know today based on the USTR as we go into what\u2019s going to be a first increase on September 1, knowing that there\u2019s another one in October and then finally December 15. Those are the ones that we know of right now. ","Kelly Bania","Just on the inventory, how much has been mitigated by just bringing inventory in early?","Gary Philbin","In scale of what we sell, we try to bring items in. It\u2019s not a huge amount. I mean, of course you try to bring it in if it\u2019s on the water, but keeping in mind it\u2019s six weeks before you leave a port and you get somewhere else, and we\u2019re often not given six weeks to make much of a move. If we can do anything, we do, but it\u2019s not meaningful on the scale of what we\u2019re talking about on cost of goods and the tariffs.","Operator","Our final question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. ","Edward Kelly","Yes, hi guys. Good morning. Just a few questions for you. First, I just wanted to ask you about store manager turnover at Family Dollar. I was hoping you could give us an update on the progress that you\u2019re making there and the initiatives that you in place to improve that.","Duncan Mac Naughton","Hey Edward, it\u2019s Duncan. Thanks for the question. I will tell you that store manager turnover has improved slightly. We\u2019re still at a level that I\u2019m not happy with, but last year we focused all our training and our field meeting on Year of the Manager, which was all about training our people, giving them tools, about hiring the right person, training the right person, and retaining the right person. We gave them many tools and consistent playbooks across the chain to do that, and they\u2019ve all been trained on that. We highlighted it again this year and updated those toolkits, and we\u2019ve had national recruiting fairs, as you\u2019re probably aware, and we\u2019ve made progress there. It does attract a fair amount of people.","Gary Philbin","I would just have to call out, with some of the same efforts, Dollar Tree is going to have one of its best three years ever since I\u2019ve been here on store manager turnover. I think the initiatives are well focused and pointed at the right things, and we\u2019re working real hard to get both banners to what ought to be a banner year on store manager turnover.","Edward Kelly","Great. Just a follow-up on Dollar Tree Plus, any color you can provide on timing around a decision in terms of your assessment of the initiatives, and then do tariffs at all--an escalation of tariffs impact strategically how you\u2019re thinking about the Plus format?","Gary Philbin","Well on the timing side, I think as we get and evolve the assortment, we\u2019re going to learn more, so I can\u2019t quite give you a timeline. I\u2019m more interested in what can I learn from giving our customers an evolving assortment that will tell us more--that resonates with her when she\u2019s in a Dollar Tree.","As far as tariffs, obviously anybody out there today who\u2019s importing is affected no matter what the price point, it obviously goes into the equation, but it does make you take a look at where you\u2019re buying from. But to hit the mark, you have to really focus on what the customer wants, as always in retail, and for our Dollar Tree stores, how does that play out when we take a look at retails that go up to $5. I think that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on - what\u2019s our Dollar Tree customer going to look for in our world, and that\u2019s what our merchandising teams are very focused on. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. Mr. Guiler, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Thank you Cassie, and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree.

Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy J. Reid","Thank you, Kate. Good morning and welcome to the Dollar Tree conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.","Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter, and recent developments in our business. Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance, and provide guidance for 2012.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of which are on file with the SEC.

You are advised that all earnings and margin comparisons in today's remarks from this point forward will exclude that charge unless otherwise noted.","At the end of our planned remarks, we will open your call to questions, which we ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, our CEO. Bob?","Bob Sasser","","Thanks, Tim. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our call. This morning, we announced our sales and earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011. I\u2019m pleased to report that our comparable store sales increased 7.3%; driven primarily by increased traffic, this was our largest fourth quarter comparable sales increase since 1999 and a much smaller company.","Total sales increased 12.8% to $1.95 billion. Earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.60 per diluted share. This represents a 24% increase over last year\u2019s $1.29 per share. Operating margin for the fourth quarter 2011 was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points over the fourth quarter of last year; and net income rose 15.6% to $187.9 million.","For the full year fiscal 2011, comp store sales increased 6%; that\u2019s on top of a 6.3% comp store sales increase last year. And net sales were $6.63 billion; an increase of 12.7% over fiscal 2010. Earnings for the full year were $4.03 per diluted share, an increase of 24.8% compared with $3.23 per share last year. Notably, operating income increased by $125.8 million. Operating margin was 11.8%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with last year and net income for the year rose 18% to $488.3 million. This was on top of a 29.1% increase in net income prior year.","I\u2019m very pleased with these results. They speak to the value and relevance of our merchandize, the power, and flexibility of our model, and the day-by-day execution of our strategy across the entire organization. Our stores were well stocked and merchandised. Our seasonal merchandise assortments exceeded the customers\u2019 expectations for style and value. Seasonal transitions were well executed and we were consistently in stock on basic items that customers need everyday.","On top of all of that, weather was favorable throughout the quarter. As a result, customers continued to respond in record numbers. Sales growth in the fourth quarter came from a mix of both basic and discretionary products. The top performing categories included food, snacks and beverage, health and beauty care, housewares and home products, party supplies, and of course, seasonal merchandise.","The success of Dollar Tree, as it has always been, is based on our focus on the customer. We aim our efforts at increasing the value of the merchandise for a $1, improving the quality of our shopping environment and providing the infrastructure that supports the business. The Dollar Tree merchandising model is flexible and we use this strategy of ever-changing assortments to our advantage.","Our assortments are planned to offer the greatest value to the customer for $1 and to do so at a cost that delivers our required merchandise margin. To the customer, this means, there\u2019s always something new at Dollar Tree. As customers strive to balance their budgets, they can find the high value basics they need, while enjoying the thrill of the hunt on every visit. Seasonal assortment are fresh, colorful and fun, and provide merchandise energy in the stores.","This strategic advantage has been validated by results. History shows that we\u2019re consistently able to manage through inflationary and deflationary cycles by changing the product or changing the source. Our merchants work everyday to deliver an exciting assortment of product with the best values ever, and our planning, allocations and replenishment organization directed to the right stores.","As a result, inventory productivity continues to improve. Inventory turns increased to 4.22 turns in 2011, compared with 4.17 turns in 2010. This is the seventh consecutive annual increase. Our store teams continue to consistently deliver on the promise of a clean, bright and fun place to shop. Seasonal transitions have been well executed with fresh and timely displays of merchandise for every season. In the fourth quarter we executed quick transitions throughout Christmas and on to big game in Valentine\u2019s Day.","We are now set for DollarDays in St. Patrick\u2019s Day and we\u2019re building for the Easter season. As we continue to grow, we pay very close attention to our infrastructure needs. The Dollar Tree infrastructure has been built to be solid and scalable. This year we expanded our distribution center in Savannah, Georgia, from its original size of 600,000 square feet to 1 million square feet to support continued growth of our business in the southeast. This project was completed on time and on budget with the total of $19.5 million of capital investment using existing cash.","As always we plan to add capacity strategically to support our growth ahead of the need. In this regard, we\u2019re currently finalizing plans to increase our logistics capacity in the northeast, and I expect these plans to be finalized over the next three months.","Our current logistics infrastructure can support sales nationally up to $8 billion. It provides efficient service to our stores today and asset leverage as we continue to grow. For the full year 2011, as planned we opened 278 new stores, and relocated and expanded 91 stores for a total of 369 projects.","Selling square footage increased 6.9% and we ended the year with 4,351 stores. Our plan for 2012 includes approximately 315 new stores and 75 relocations or expansions for a total of 390 projects in the U.S. and Canada.","We view growth opportunities in several ways. In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand categories, to grow new retail formats, to expand geographic reach and to open more productive stores. I am pleased to say that we continue to make progress in store productivity.","New store sales per square foot are increasing driven by improved site selection, by right sizing our store to the markets, by opening new stores earlier in the year through improved staffing, building the bench of qualified store management and by emphasizing and expanding the most productive categories of merchandise.","Average new store productivity increased once again in 2011 to the highest level in 10 years. Our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 376 net additional stores in 2011, including 125 new stores and we now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,220 stores. This important category is extremely productive, it serves the current needs of our customers and it drives traffic into our stores, which provides incremental sales across all categories, including our higher margin discretionary product.","While faster turning lower margin consumer products continue to lead the way and comp increases, our traffic has increased and our overall comp increase has been the result of growth in both consumer products and in higher margin variety merchandise.","In addition to opening new Dollar Tree stores, increasing new store productivity and expanding new categories like frozen and refrigerated, a key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats, and the expansion of our geographic reach.","Deal$ is our multi-price format, that Deal$ is not everything as a dollar, but everything as a value. By lifting the restriction of a $1 price point we can serve even more customers with more products and more categories. As we grow and refine the Deal$ concept customers are responding favorably, more customers are signing us everyday, comp sales are impressive in order the result of increases in both traffic and average ticket.","We are excited about the growth potential of the concept and the opportunity that it gives us to serve even more customers across the country. We opened 28 new Deal$ stores in 2011 and end of the year with a net total of 182 Deal$ stores. We plan to continue this growth rate in 2012.","Our expansion into Canada is proceeding and progressing, as you may recall, we acquired Dollar Giant in the fourth quarter of 2010. At the time it was a chain of 86 stores. In 2011 we increased the store count by about 15% and we ended fiscal 2011 with 99 stores in Canada.","While short-term performance has lagged early expectations, our primary focus in 2011 was rationalizing merchandize assortments for the Canadian market, investing in infrastructure, integrating processes and staff, developing real-estate plans and training and building store teams and merchandize teams for the future. Our goal in Canada is to operate on an identical platform to the merchandizing and productivity systems that supports U.S. stores and we have made great progress toward that goal in a short period of time, I\u2019m very pleased.","Highlights include, aligning merchandizing plans and working to solidify our logistics model in Canada. In addition, we are now supplying product to our stores using our U.S. WMS system through distribution centers in British Colombia and Ontario. We completed the installations and training of store-level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems in the third quarter of last year. This was a critical step in our plan as sales data from these systems supports planning, allocations, and replenishments. And we recently completed year end SKU level inventories in all stores.","With our core technology in place, we now have visibility through our sales on hand and on order by SKU in store. Equally important, we are building history by store\u2019s SKU, all key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain.","With this information, we are beginning to rollout (how to) replenishment of basics and employing smart allocations of new and seasonal merchandise, just as we did successfully in the U.S. And as we\u2019ve experienced in the U.S., the result will be an improved flow of product to the stores on a timelier basis, allowing for most efficient store operations and increased level of in-stock or basic product. Higher store productivity increased inventory turns and an overall improvement in customer satisfaction.","I\u2019m extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree, Canada. I\u2019m proud of what was accomplished in only one year, and I know that we can do much better. We have a highly motivated and energetic team and I\u2019m confident that the results will be well worth the effort.","This year, we intend to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. And over the long-term, we believe the Canadian markets have support up to a thousand Dollar Tree stores. This is an addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the U.S. plus additional growth in our Deal$ format.","Dollar Tree Direct, our e-commerce business is providing an opportunity to reach new customers through an additional channel of distribution. New customers continue to discover Dollar Tree Direct everyday. Traffic on the site grew to four million visitors in the fourth quarter. That was a 25% increase over the fourth last year. We are using this opportunity to drive direct sales, expand the brand and to attract customers into our stores with the offer of high-value merchandize and free shipping for pick up in any of our stores across the country.","Sales continue to grow as many customers prefer the convenience of online shopping; especially for larger quantities needed for parties or events or by small businesses and organizations. If you haven\u2019t had the opportunity, I would invite you to take a look at our site at www.dollartree.com.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance.","Kevin S. Wampler","Thanks Bob. As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 24% in the fourth quarter to $1.60. The increase resulted from our strong sales; a 20 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 30 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin grew to 37.8% during the fourth quarter, compared with 37.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. This is our highest gross profit margin since the fourth quarter of 2001. We achieved strong leverage on our occupancy and distribution expenses; reflecting the 7.3% comp store sales growth, which more than offset the impact that the continued shifts in product mix and basic consumable products increased by about a 140 basis points of that percentage of sales in the fourth quarter.","The higher cost relative to sales of our Canadian stores and the impact on our shrink from our first SKU-based inventories of Dollar Tree Canada and a slight increase in our freight expense relative to sales as savings on ocean freight partially offset the impacts of diesel prices that averaged more than $0.62 per gallon above the same period last year.","SG&A expenses were 22.2% of sales for the quarter, which a 30 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter last year. This was driven primarily by a 20 basis point reduction in depreciation, a 10 basis point decline in payroll related expenses due to the increased store labor productivity, and leverage on comp store sales, as well as lower utility costs reflecting the milder winter weather. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in general liability insurance expense.","Debit and credit card fees were flat, reflecting growth in usage of these types of tender offset by the lower legislated rate. In the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter last year, debit card penetration increased 120 basis points, and credit card penetration increased 30 basis points. SNAP penetration although small continues to grow.","Operating income increased $43.3 million compared with the fourth quarter last year and operating margin was 15.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter last year, and was the highest operating margin since 2002. For the full year, operating income increased $125.8 million and our operating margin grew to 11.8%, up 70 basis points from last year\u2019s 11.1% operating margin. Dollar Tree\u2019s operating margin remains among the highest in the value retail sector.","The tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 37% in the fourth quarter last year. The higher rate primarily reflects a lower percentage of state tax credits compared with the fourth quarter last year, which also included some benefit from the favorable tax treatment of the Ollie's dividend.","For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 37.4%, compared with 36.9% in 2010. Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, cash and investments at year end totaled $288.3 million versus $486 million at the end of the fiscal 2010. During the fourth quarter, we invested $300 million for share repurchase through an ASR and repurchased 3.5 million shares.","For the full year, we invested $645.9 million for the share repurchase and repurchased 8.7 million shares.","The diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $117.6 million for the fourth quarter and $121.2 million for the full year of 2011. In October, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for share repurchase. As of year end, we have $1.2 billion remaining in our authorization. We will continue to view share repurchase opportunistically and we will update you on additional share repurchases if any at the end of the quarter in which they may occur.","As Bob mentioned, our inventory turns increased in 2011 for the seventh consecutive year to $4.22 and this includes Canada. Consolidated inventory at quarter end was 8% greater than at the same time last year and selling square footage grew by 6.9%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 1%. The slight increase in inventory on a per square foot basis supports the earlier Easter selling season as well as inventory for new stores that are opening up early in Q1. We are well positioned as we begin the year and expect continued improvement on our inventory turns in 2012.","Capital expenditures were $53.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares with $32 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year of 2011, capital expenditures were $250.1 million compared with $178.7 million in 2010. For fiscal year 2012, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to 325 stores, IT system enhancements, and approximately $80 million towards a new distribution center in the Northeast U.S. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $95 million.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $44 million for the fourth quarter versus $42.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full-year, depreciation was $164.2 million, a 25 basis point decrease from last year. For 2012, depreciation and amortization is estimated to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. Our guidance for 2012 includes a couple of assumptions.","First, in regard to freight expense, we will soon be negotiating new ocean rates that become effective on May 1st. As always, we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations, nor can anyone accurately predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that ocean freight rates and diesel prices will be similar to their current levels on average throughout fiscal 2012.","Second, Easter is two weeks earlier this year. This represents about an $8 million sales challenge in the first quarter. Third, due to the retail calendar, 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million in incremental sales and $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full-year.","Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 37.7% for the full-year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 116.9 million shares for the first quarter and 117.1 million shares for the full-year. While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.","With that in mind, for the first quarter of 2012, we\u2019re forecasting sales in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.97, which would represent an 11% to 18% increase compared to the first quarter of 2011 earnings of $0.82 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low-to-mid single-digit comparable store sales increase and store square footage of [about] 7%.","For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.25 billion to $7.42 billion based on a low-to-mid single-digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.2% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.90, representing an increase of between 15% and 22% over our record earnings per share of $4.03 in fiscal 2011 and takes into account the 53rd week that will be included in the fourth quarter of 2012.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks Kevin. Once again, I\u2019m very pleased with our company\u2019s performance in fourth quarter and for the year. There were many notable accomplishments in 2011. Comp store sales increased 6% and total sales grew 12.7%. We achieved record sales of over $6.6 billion, largely $1 at a time. Despite high fuel prices, operating margins increased by 70 basis points to 11.8%, the best in the [track] of 11 years. And earnings per share increased by nearly 25% on top of a 36% increase in the prior year.","In addition, this year, the company completed the expansion of our Savannah DC, a key element in supporting our contingent growth in the southeast. We opened 278 new stores and completed 91 relocations and expansions. We achieved the highest new store productivity in 10 years since 2001 when our average size store was much smaller.","We gained traction, growth, and new customers with our Deal$ model. Comp sales at Deal$ benefited from both increased traffic and average ticket. In 2011, we built a solid foundation for growth in Canada. We expect Canadian performance to improve throughout the year, especially as we gain traction in the second half. We made significant enhancements to Dollar Tree Direct including break pack, Spanish-language and mobile capability.","We repurchased $645.9 billion of stock in 2011, and we announced a renewed authorization from the Board for an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchase, of which $1.2 billion remained. By any measure, it was an outstanding year and I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re singularly positioned to do even better in the future.","I see great opportunity ahead for Dollar Tree because our stores, merchants and support teams are guided by a strategic vision that involves every element of the business revolving around the customer because the business model is powerful and flexible tested by time and validated by results, we\u2019ve proven that Dollar Tree can adapt to a changing environment. Through good and bad economic times, the company has consistently increased sales and earnings. And we\u2019ve never been better positioned for continued growth and improvement.","The balanced mix of high value consumer basics and the unique assortment of fun, seasonally correct discretionary products, positions Dollar Tree stores to be relevant to customers in all economic circumstances.","At Dollar Tree, yes, you can afford it. We have a solid and scalable infrastructure that we\u2019re leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficiently supply chain logistics, more productive stores, and crisper overall execution. And there is more to come. There are plenty of opportunities to grow our business new Dollar Tree stores, more productive new stores, category expansion, new formats, DEAL$ and Dollar Tree Direct and expanded geography. Canada provides us an opportunity for a substantial growth.","All of this provides a roadmap for sustained profitable growth. At Dollar Tree, we have a vision of where we want to go and the people and the infrastructure and capital like it happened. 2011 was another terrific year at Dollar Tree and we\u2019re off to a great start in 2012.","We will now address your questions; so that we can accommodate as many callers as time permits, we ask that we limit your questions to two.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Again, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question with only one follow-up question. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning. Just on the SG&A expense line. If we exclude depreciation, it was the least favorable \u2013 the year, but you guys actually posted your best comp of the year. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could shed some light on why there wasn\u2019t more leverage. Is that because of that general liability expense was so substantial or was there something off that cost that not have as much leverage?","Bob Sasser","I think if you look at the quarters through the year, Chuck, one of the places we\u2019ve gotten a lot of leverage is in our payroll-related area. We didn\u2019t get as much leverage this quarter there and there\u2019s a couple of reasons for that. One it was such a great quarter; our sale, bonus incentives at the store level saw a nice increase, which is great. You know we\u2019d love to reward our sales managers out there when they do a great job like they did in Q4.","Also we saw a little bit of an increase in our payroll tax line item and then the other place we\u2019ve been getting some benefits throughout the year and \u2013 was in health insurance. And as I spoke to at earlier in the year, I said, you know we cannot expect, necessarily expect that to continue throughout the year, and we didn\u2019t see that in the fourth quarter. So I think that\u2019s probably the biggest change on a quarter-to-quarter basis within that category of expenses.","Charles Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. And then just one follow-up if I could, can you just remind us on the (inaudible) there in the quarter. What the mix of traffic and ticket were and if you could shed any lights on February is off to an okay start, just wondering if you could maybe quantify that for us relative to the guidance?","Bob Sasser","Chuck, this is Bob. I think I can add some colors to sales throughout the quarter. Sales were very strong throughout the fourth quarter from November, December and January. They actually picked up pace November or December, picked up the pace over November and January over December as far as comp sales increase. Our sales were strong across the whole geography. Everybody was basically up. The highest growth, comp store growth constant growth was in the Midwest followed very closely by the Mid-Atlantic and then New England. So it was very tightly packed in that regard.","The sales were driven almost entirely by traffic. Ticket was up just slightly for the quarter. As I\u2019ve said earlier, the weather was favorable across the whole country, we didn\u2019t lose much because of store closing with weather, and we are really pleased with the cadence of the comps during the quarter.","Charles Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now hear from John Zolidis with Buckingham Research Group.","John Zolidis \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","Hey, good morning. Fantastic year.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","John Zolidis \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","Two questions. One on the traffic with the large increase that you saw, could you talk about what you think is driving traffic, is it incremental customers, is it existing customers coming back more frequently. And in conjunction with that, can you talk about what advertising and marketing you do and whether that\u2019s having an impact. And then the second question is on assortment changes, you mentioned the importance of having newness and different items within the stores.","Can you specifically talk about some items that you added, some changes that you made that may have benefited sales in 2011. And then looking forward to 2012, do you see as much newness and maybe you can give us a specific example of items you are adding to assortment next year. Thanks.","Unidentified Company Representative","What\u2019s the first question? What\u2019s driving traffic?","Bob Sasser","What\u2019s driving traffic? It was a combination I think, we believe of both new customers finding us all the time, it\u2019s still pretty tough out there, unemployment is high, we sell things people need everyday and it\u2019s only a Dollar, and through word of mouth, they are learning about that and they are trying us and they\u2019re coming back then more often. So as new customers and I believe they are shopping with us, I know they\u2019re shopping with us more often. The mix of consumer products that we have now, which is about 50% of our business, that\u2019s more frequently purchased. So people are coming back more often to buy that.","And we will tell you that, when they are in buying the consumer products, we are also seeing a lift in our variety merchandise, it\u2019s not growing as fast as the consumer products, but it\u2019s growing pretty significantly. So we are very pleased with what we are getting from the traffic there. As far as new items, we are always adding new items there, if you look at our Christmas assortment this year, you saw just a lot of tremendous new merchandise things, you had seen a Dollar store anyway, Dollar Tree [per Dollar], you may have seen it in the department stores, but you wouldn\u2019t have seen it in a store like ours from only a dollar to a themed ornament wall that we had was all color relevant and very timely to the business.","We\u2019ve had the little solar items with the dancing flowers and the solar stakes and all that we\u2019ve done with that this year that\u2019s all new merchandise. But we change about 50% of our assortment every year, every season at least 50% every season and 50% every year. So part of who we are is always that ever changing assortment of new merchandise that adds fun and as I call it merchandise energy to the store. It adds opportunity a reason to come back more often. It started what we call the thrill of the hunt.","So, go and take a look around, you\u2019re going to find something that you didn\u2019t see last time, and the fronts of the stores we pay particular attention to changing those out with our items of the week and our drive items and of course our seasonal sets in the front of the store always changing.","John Zolidis \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","Thank you.","Bob Sasser","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will now go to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey, guys from a merchandising perspective, can you speak to the opportunity in the second half, given the more depletionary environment and along those same lines can you talk to the potential gross margin opportunity as well.","Unidentified Company Representative","Well it\u2019s a \u2013 the second half we\u2019re very excited about second half 2012. We just came back from our import trip in January. As always it was successful, just the very nature of how we plan our business, we\u2019re always going to come back with hitting or exceeding our planned markup targets for the trip, because that\u2019s the way we build our merchandise assortment based on the cost. This is the most value that we can give the customer for a $1 at a margin that we\u2019re willing to accept. So, we just finished our January trip. It\u2019s very successful, and our markup is higher this year, and our value is even better than ever, because not only with the, I think I would characterize it as a more stable price environment in China versus a year ago.","We\u2019ve always been able to manage our margins because we\u2019re in control of it, but it felt like just anecdotally this year that business is down a little bit in China, and we\u2019re good buyers and big buyers, and for that reason we\u2019ve got good relationships, and as a result there did not seem to be as much pressure overall on the cost of the items we\u2019re able to get the prices that we needed, and increase the value at the same time, which is what we tend to do. If there is deflation in cost, we tend to put more value in the product, because that\u2019s how we drive the sales. Our price is $1 whether there is pressure on cost inflation or deflation, our retail is still $1. So, our goals and is to provide the most value for the dollar at the margins that we need.","It was very favorable. I would characterize the January trip is very favorable. I\u2019m excited about the new assortments coming in, not only in the second half, but right now as you know our spring business I\u2019m expecting some good results there. Easter looks really good out there. If you haven\u2019t been in one of our stores it\u2019s really it\u2019s starting to build the Dollar Days promotion that we kicked off the year with, is looking good. It adds lot of color to the front of our store. And our stores teams, I\u2019ll tell you, did the best job I\u2019ve ever seen in transitioning from Christmas and to the Big Game and then into Dollar Days and eastern St. Patrick's Day. So, Kudos to those people, and our customers are responding very favorably to that. Thank you.","Matthew Boss \u2013 JPMorgan","That\u2019s great. Second question, with traffic contributing almost the entire comp today, it seems like there\u2019s a real opportunity on the ticket side as well, especially with our average basket at less than $8. If we are in a slightly improving economic environment here, with you guys slightly a higher demographic than some of your peers, any initiative to drive the ticket and how big of an opportunity do you think this is?","Bob Sasser","Well, I think it\u2019s always an opportunity. And first of all, fourth quarter traditionally has more of the sales pop coming from traffic than ticket. It\u2019s just sort of the way the rhythm of our business works. So this wasn\u2019t that unusual. But taking advantage of that traffic is really a big opportunity. Initiatives that we\u2019re focused on is all about the front of the store; from the time you walk in, to the first feature that you see, the drive item, the item of the month, item of the week, changing those things out. [We\u2019re] really measuring the productivity of the fronts of our stores.","We\u2019re looking at our checkouts, all the impulse locations on the checkouts, in front of the checkouts, the front end-caps that have faced the checkouts; that whole front aisle we see as a huge opportunity with impulse and related sales and the chance to get that last one item sold from the customer. Throughout the store, you\u2019d see a lot of related merchandise end-caps and features. We\u2019re not only selling the paper towels, but we\u2019re selling the paper towel holder and the rest of the cleaning supplies; and just always that suggestive selling on all of our features throughout the store.","Clip-strips, we\u2019ve done a big job with clip-strips, getting those placed around the stores; that\u2019s productivity issue for our stores, because it\u2019s a way of hanging out a lot of merchandise in a pretty quick order and also it gets a lot of related sales out there throughout the store.","So you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right on. There\u2019s a big opportunity to take advantage of this increase in traffics that we have to raise that average ticket and also to keep these people coming back; because we want to make sure that they enjoy the experience, the store is clean, it\u2019s seasonally relevant, the shelves are full, the basic in-stock is bigger. With gas prices going up, they don\u2019t want to would have waste a trip to the store. I want them to have that \u2013 the glass clear and the dish detergent, the (inaudible) towels that \u2013 whatever they came for; we want to have that for them and then while they\u2019re in the store, at every turn we challenge them to buy another item.","Matthew Boss \u2013 JPMorgan","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. We\u2019ll continue on to Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Kevin, I was just wondering if you could follow up on the question on the leverage, appreciate the (inaudible) to why we didn\u2019t see better leverage on such a strong comp. Maybe you could have us think about on a go-forward basis; what\u2019s the appropriate run-rate, what sort of comps we need to leverage expenses and how we should be thinking about sort of the puts and takes going forward?","Kevin S. Wampler","","Yeah, I would tell you in general, what we have said over the last two years that to leverage our SG&A, we\u2019d probably need a 2% comp or \u2013 for there about to give or take a little bit, it kind of depends on the quarter as well. You know, I think as we look at the guidance we gave you, if I look at it for the year, and you\u2019d see the improvement in the operating margin, the expectation I think would be for the gross profit to be \u2013 fairly flat. And that we would potentially see the benefit, an improvement in the SG&A inside of our business. So that\u2019s kind of the way we think about it as we go forward.","Adrianne Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then when we think about long term EBIT margin \u2013 as Bob you mentioned 11.8% is where you\u2019re entering the year, it\u2019s the best than the past 11 years. Maybe you help us think about long term, what is the appropriate EBIT margin\u2019s target for your business and how we should think about getting there between gross profits and SG&A?","Kevin S. Wampler","Well, as we look at that, again, the guidance that that we gave basically, our short-term goal is to get above a 12% operating margin, okay. And basically, guidance would get you there. The longer-term goal is 13%, 13% is the highest operating margin we have ever reported as a public company and that was in 1999. So that is our longer-term goal.","Obviously, we are going to continue to grow, we are going to continue to grow our store base, which is going to help us create leverage, we\u2019ve done a good job leveraging our occupancy and distribution; we\u2019ve done a pretty good job leveraging our SG&A and keeping that growth to a reasonable level. And again, from a gross profit standpoint, from a margin standpoint of product margin is important that we \u2013 the value of our products is what is really important and so if we do go through deflationary cycles, we don\u2019t put that in our pocket, we put it back into the products and our customer really appreciates that, and that\u2019s what they look to us for. So I think, we think 13% is the reasonable goal, long-term.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll continue onto Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. Thanks. Hi, good morning, Bob.","Bob Sasser","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Canada, every call when you purchase the Dollar Giant, they were using a multiple price point approach similar to Dollarama, (inherit) effect going forward, all of that new Canadian stores will be branded as Dollar Tree. Does that imply that all of the merchandising strategy will change to, I guess, (inaudible) approach in Canada or will you stick with multiple pricing approach in that market?","Bob Sasser","No, we don\u2019t have a multiple price, and what we have is everything\u2019s a $1.25 or less. The other guys up there have the multiple price approach up to I think [now $3]. Dollar Giant had changed before we had purchased the company to the everything\u2019s a $1.25 or less, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re staying with. We\u2019re going to Canada opening up Dollar Trees that\u2019s $1.25 or less. We will be the only major single price point retailer at $1.25 or less in Canada, and that\u2019s the focus that we have.","The Dollar Trees that we open Canada will be [$1.25 Canadian]. So we\u2019re really not changing that strategy. I think it\u2019s a good strategy. We like the single price point strategy. We know how to do a single price point strategy, and what we have to do is get the value equation right. That\u2019s why our Canadian team is extra important and that\u2019s the reason that we wanted to partner up with a Canadian company versus just going greenfield is so that \u2013 they do understand the margin equation, what a [$1.25 Canadian], what\u2019s the value of that is.","So as we\u2019re building these assortments, there\u2019s a little bit of difference in the value equation. We think it\u2019s stronger, we think it gives us a better opportunity frankly in Canada. Right now, the currency is at parity, but it hasn\u2019t always been. So this gives us the ability to manage the value for the [$1.25 Canadian] and for those customers even more value.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","And the $1.25 item would be comparable to a $1 Dollar Tree item in the U.S.?","Bob Sasser","Well, some are. We have things in Canadian assortments that we don\u2019t exactly have the same in the Dollar Tree assortments and a lot of things will be the same.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Okay.","Bob Sasser","We\u2019re buying extra value well items for Canada, just like we buy well items of our Dollar Tree assortment and they may or may not be the same. So, our Canadian team we have in place there that\u2019s one of their main focuses is to maintain that value comparison for the Canadian currency versus the U.S. currency.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","And when you\u2019re alluding to Canada, not meeting your expectations this past year, were you referring to the revenues for store or are you thinking more about the support logistics systems integration","Bob Sasser","The Canadian we\u2019re really excited about Canada. I mean I\u2019m particularly excited about our future. Short-term we faced headwinds there of our own doing, but it was something that had to be done. The main headwinds that we faced in Canada this past year were around rationalized in the merchandise assortment, dropping some of the SKUs adding some new SKUs, adding the import piece that we\u2019re doing in the U.S. getting the basics end lines. There is a lot of turmoil in the assortment in Canada. And you always drop things faster than you could imagine that, plus we are in the process of setting up two new distribution centers and moving them. And as a result, we lost some sales and that as a result lost some leverage on our occupancy cost. So, that\u2019s one thing.","The second thing was we did our SKU inventory. It was the first SKU inventory that\u2019s ever been done there. It\u2019s very critical to the way we\u2019re going to run the business, but we did that in fourth quarter, and shrink was a little higher than we expected. So, the combination of those two things sort of teamed up and my expectation, I don\u2019t think met any of expectations, but on the plus side it was such a great accomplishment that we made in a short order. Maybe we didn\u2019t have any right to expect this better than we had. We solidified the logistics model now new DCs and DC and in Ontario we\u2019ve got the Dollar Tree WMS system in there.","We have POS in the stores \u2013 all trained in all of the stores. We got the SKU level inventories and that\u2019s going to allow us to do a lot of things with allocation \u2013 smart allocations putting the right products in the right stores, based on sales, based on inventory. It\u2019s going to help us with replenishing the basics. It\u2019s going to take our store people in Canada a little more out of the reordering process and more into the merchandizing process, telling the counters, and running the cash raised here.","So we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019ve done and what that means for us in the future. Result of all of that, as I said in the prepared remarks, that is more timelier deliveries of products, more seasonally relevant stores because of the timelier deliveries, it\u2019s going to be a more effective store, by knowing what \u2013 having visibility of what\u2019s coming into the store, our store teams can plan their payroll accordingly and get the product to the shelf faster. It\u2019ll make for a fuller and a funnier store and a more complete store and at the end of the day, it will be more satisfying customer.","So we\u2019re expecting a lot from Canada, from all that we\u2019ve done in 2011, it was a year of investment, it was a year of integration, it was a year of staffing and training and at the end of the rainbow there is \u2013 the rewards are just terrific because it\u2019s kind of provide for sustainable growth for us for years to come as I said we can operate a 1000 stores over the longer term in Canada. So what does that mean? This year, I\u2019m expecting improvement throughout the year, especially as we enter into second half and into fourth quarter.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Great, thanks Bob. I appreciate it.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll continue on to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is (inaudible) for Peter. Thanks for taking our questions. So you\u2019ve been a little more aggressive over the last few quarters with your repurchases and based on the sizable authorization you have in place, what is your current position on taking on leverage to repurchase stock in 2012?","Kevin S. Wampler","","Well, as we\u2019ve looked at our repurchases and our thought processes around that, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s really changed. We\u2019ve looked it opportunistically. It\u2019s become maybe a little more as a regular program maybe over the last couple of years with regular repurchases, and given our cash flow that we generate, that does made sense. We feel it is a great way to return value to our long-term shareholders.","Historically, we have not been one necessarily to take on a lot of leverage in that regard. It\u2019s something we can think about and we do think about and we talk about as far as our overall capital structure, but its one piece of an overall though process as it relates to the capital structure. And again, we\u2019re going to have some larger outlays for capital expenditures this coming year with the upcoming expansion to a new DC up in the Northeast. So we have taken all those things into consideration as we look at it. We obviously do believe though that it is a good way to return value.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then, I know you mentioned weather was a benefit in the quarter and I was just wondering if you might be able to maybe provide an estimate on how much you thought it impacted comps?","Bob Sasser","You know that\u2019s hard to say [as a] same thing, because we\u2019re on a roll anyway and things were well executed. But certainly weather has been almost perfect this year. It\u2019s been the best fourth quarter weather that we\u2019ve ever had. We didn\u2019t have the snowstorms; the snowmageddon that we had last year in Washington D.C. in North up into the Northeast. We didn\u2019t have the blizzards across through the middle of the country and we basically kept our stores open throughout the fourth quarter. And I can\u2019t really \u2013 I don\u2019t how to quantify that for you except that 7.3% comp for the quarter is positively impacted by that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Well, thanks a lot. Good luck next year.","Bob Sasser","Well, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for just a few more questions. We\u2019ll now go to Aram Rubinson with NOMURA.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 NOMURA Equity Research","Hi, good morning. This is Ed sitting in for Aram. How are you?","Bob Sasser","Fine, Ed.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 NOMURA Equity Research","I just want to speak to you about your openings next year. Can you just speak to maybe the real estate profile, strip centers and such, and different types of locations? Is it pretty consistent and also on the geography, the openings are those factors fairly consistent this year with last?","Bob Sasser","I think so, we are looking for that approximately 10,000 square foot store, sometimes we take a little more depending on the availability and the economics, sometimes we take a little less on the availability and economics. But somewhere around that 10,000 square foot is what we like to have, we like to place them where Middle-America (work for) shops and that has a change, then we have 48 state footprint plus Canada now, and the distribution capacity and the people and the systems to reach all of those.","We are still looking at although West Coast is one of our most populous areas, California I think our biggest state now. We are still looking at growth in California. We built our new San Bernardino DC and Southern California there last year to help provide support for that growth. We still like the Southeast. We expanded Savannah this past year, because many stores as we have in Florida. And in the Southeast, we think there is room for more, the customers really like us there and we\u2019ve been able to serve them very well.","So growth I think with that 10,000 square foot footprint, the Deal$ stores are aimed largely at the more urban markets, it\u2019s a multi-price point higher volume model that we are building there, it\u2019s one that can leverage those higher fixed costs that we have and say, Brooklyn or Bronx or in the Northeast. So \u2013 and we are seeing good results from there; we are seeing some leverage from there; we are seeing the volume from those customers as we improve that model. So although those \u2013 some of them live in suburbia, you will see a lot of those being aimed at those urban city center kind of markets, whether it\u2019d be Miami or Atlanta or New York, New Jersey.","So, a real estate strategy is onward and upward, we have an economic model that we have to meet. We have \u2013 we take strip centers, we take pre-standards, we new construct and when we can bind it, there has been a little more themes like little up-tick in there slightly not much. But we take most any way shape or form as long as it meets our demographic concerns, our size constraints and also our economic model.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 NOMURA Equity Research","Thanks for that. And there is a model, the rental rates per foot going forward, and I have been factoring in faster growth from Canada where you have higher occupancy cost there. Are there any other trends or the underlying trends in the U.S. in terms of rates per foot?","Bob Sasser","We are always in the market to \u2013 we try to take the building as it is more and more, because we can take control of them earlier, because we can do the investment the way we want to that we can build the store out, the way we want to and then we can build a store out the way we want to. So that in general tends to lower the rental rates. We really look at it more as how much volume we can do; the occupancy as a percent of the store sales is the most important thing that we look at. So we can pay the prices of rental per foot in New York and leverage that, and we can pay the price in North Carolina and leverage that. But it\u2019s two different numbers.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 NOMURA Equity Research","Thank you.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one additional question. We\u2019ll now go to Dan Binder.","Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Hi, good morning. My question was related to the combination of mix and your comments on margin for the year of being roughly flat. I\u2019m just curious what your best guess is on where the consumable mix will go in the coming year roughly and how that marries with the gross margin; I think you said flattish. Particularly since your China trip, it sounds like it\u2019s gone so well.","Kevin S. Wampler","As we look at this past year, our consumable mix moved about 130 basis points for the year, and so it\u2019s a little higher than that in the fourth quarter, but for the year it\u2019s about 130 basis points. I think our customer obviously is looking for those goods, those basic everyday consumables and we\u2019re providing that. And that part of our business is comping a little faster than our variety business, but it\u2019s the mix that works very, very well.","As Bob mentioned, the [flying trips] for our import goods have gone very well and we continue to come back with better IMUs than the year prior and we\u2019ve said that consistently. So that bodes well for the year. So that helps us with that shift in mix a little bit. The other things that roll into that are kind of the wild cards are things like freight. And you heard us talk to freight, as far as what our assumptions are for the year. It\u2019s pretty hard to be able to predict, what\u2019s going to happen with diesel especially with some of the geopolitical issues out there, and as far as the ocean freight rate, obviously that\u2019s negotiated and we don\u2019t have those results yet.","So, I think all of those things kind of play together, but we think yeah, on an overall basis with our comp that we can continue to comp that low to mid single-digit that helps us on the occupancy and distribution and kind of at the end of day kind of all comes out in the wash kind of a flat gross profit margin so that\u2019s kind of how we look at it I think.","Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Okay and my follow-up question was more of an operational question not necessarily specific to this quarter, but as we \u2013 given that some of your stores particularly in the Tri-State area they seem like a pretty high volume stores and I\u2019m just curious as these stores continue to comp well how are you handling to the operational challenges around getting the stock getting these shelves restocked in a day just seems like in certain instances that we will see a little bit of hole here and there its more of an exception in the norm, but as these stores keep comping well it seems like you may need to add some labor to the stores do you see anything there?","Bob Sasser","Dan, that\u2019s one of the biggest learning that we\u2019re undergoing right now in those very high volume urban stores, funny you should mention that we\u2019re in the process right now of developing a new delivery model it\u2019s not necessarily more people, its more people at the right time doing the right things, and entire volume in these city locations, but it\u2019s also a tougher model to run, how do you get the freight in the door on the shelf, the cardboard out the door and out of the street. And other people have done it, we can do it too, and we\u2019re learning this. So (inaudible) last week looking at a new delivery method coming into the city, that looks like it\u2019s going to have a lot of \u2013 certainly the stores (inaudible), because it comes in more sorted and ready to go to the shelf versus the way we do it in the suburban stores.","But the answer to your question as we do have some improvements to be made and how we deliver our stores in tri-state area, the higher volume stores; how we manage the stores in those areas; how you manage the volume; how you manage the ways; how you \u2013 all the things, when you\u2019re doing more volume, everything is more. So that\u2019s one of the things we are trying master right now.","Daniel Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Great, thanks.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to, Mr. Tim Reid, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy Reid","Thank you, Devonah. Good morning, and welcome to the Dollar Tree Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2013. Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in our business. Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2013.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects of the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ material from -- materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K, all of which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so.","As a reminder, in September 2012, Dollar Tree, Inc. sold its ownership interest in Ollie's Holdings, Inc. that we will refer to as Ollie's. The sale had a favorable impact on the third quarter 2012 earnings, with an increase to net income of $0.17 per diluted share. Unless otherwise noted, all net income and earnings comparisons presented today will exclude the impact of Ollie's -- the Ollie's transaction on last year's results for the third quarter and year-to-date.","At the end of our planned remarks, we will open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions]","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, CEO of Dollar Tree. Bob?","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our sales and earnings for the third quarter of 2013.","Total sales increased 9.5% to $1,885,000,000, and comp store sales increased 3.1%, driven by increased customer traffic. Earnings for the third quarter were $0.58 per diluted share. This represents a 13.7% increase over last year's $0.51 per share, which, as Tim said, excludes the gain from the sale of our interest in Ollie's last year.","Operating margin for the third quarter 2013 was 10.8%. This was the highest third quarter operating margin in the history of the company. The previous record was 10.7%, which was set in the third quarter last year. And net income was $125.4 million versus $117.3 million in 2012.","Year-to-date through 3 quarters of 2013, total sales were $5.61 billion. This is an increase of 8.9%. Comp store sales increased 2.9%. Operating income increased by $65.5 million. Operating margin was 11.1%, an increase of 30 basis points compared with the same period last year. Net income was $383.6 million compared with $352.6 million last year. And earnings per share were $1.73, an increase of 13.1% compared with $1.53 per share last year.","I'm pleased with another solid quarterly performance, with top line and comp store sales continuing to grow. Most importantly, the Dollar Tree model is more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording a record level of third quarter earnings. Customers know that even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree, you can still splurge. Everything is only $1.","I'm also pleased with the mix of products sold and the consistency of our sales growth. Comp sales growth of the third quarter was the result of increased sales in both needs-based consumables and increased sales of our seasonal and variety categories, with our seasonal and variety categories growing at a faster pace overall.","Our comps were positive every month, with our strongest performance in October. And performance in the third quarter was relatively consistent across the country. All zones achieved positive comp store sales, with the strongest performance in the Midwest, followed by the Southeast and the Southwest.","We have room to continue growing our business and the ability to grow in many different ways by opening more stores, by opening better, more productive stores, by increasing the productivity of all our stores and by developing new formats, new markets and new channels. During the third quarter this year, we opened 117 new stores and relocated and expanded another 19 stores. Through 3 quarters of 2013, we have added 292 new stores and expanded or relocated 67 stores. Selling square footage has increased 7%, and we ended the quarter with 4,953 stores. We are on track with our new store opening plan for the full year 2013, which includes 340 new stores and 73 relocations and expansions for a total of 413 projects in 2013.","In addition to opening more stores, we have a strategy to continue to open better and more productive stores. Last year, new store productivity reached its highest level since 2001, and so far this year, our U.S. class of 2013 is tracking at a similar pace, trailed somewhat by Canada. This has been the result of a coordinated process concentrated on improved site selection, rightsizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improved staffing and building the bench of qualified store management.","Efforts to increase sales per square foot are not limited to new stores. Elements of the strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout the chain. In recent quarters, we've described some of our category-specific initiatives to drive sales. For example, in all stores, customers are seeing more powerful, seasonal and party presentations. We re-merchandised our checkout lanes and expanded assortments across the front end of our stores to create more merchandise energy and to drive impulse sales. Results of these efforts have been validated by company-leading comp sales increases in our checkout department. Additionally, we continue to rationalize and expand assortments across the chain of stationery, candy, health and beauty care, and home and household products.","In addition to assortment initiatives, store associates are emphasizing more effective customer engagement and working to drive sales of related items through cross merchandising and suggestive selling. And we're rolling out freezers and coolers at a faster pace. In the third quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 122 additional stores, for a total of 566 store installations year-to-date, exceeding our plan of 550 store installations for this year. We now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,115 stores, and we expect to add another 25 installations by fiscal year-end. This category serves the current needs of our customers and drives traffic into our stores and provides incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. Reflecting all of these initiatives, our top-performing categories in the third quarter were checkouts, frozen and refrigerated products, stationery, party supplies and candy.","Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats, the expansion of our geographic reach and the development of additional channels of distribution. Specifically, that means Deal$, Dollar Tree Canada and Dollar Tree Direct. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ stores deliver low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deal$, we're able to serve more customers with more products at value prices every day. In the third quarter, Deal$ comp sales increases were led by floral and accessories, stationery, party and seasonal, with a strong Halloween performance. We opened 10 new Deal$ stores in the third quarter, ending the quarter with a net total of 214 Deal$ stores, and we're on track with our growth plan for 2013.","Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. We're aggressively expanding our Canadian store base. In the third quarter, we opened 16 new stores and ended the quarter with 176 Canadian stores, achieving our plan to grow our store count by 25% for the year. In addition to opening new stores, we've now completed our planned re-branding of former Dollar Giant stores to Dollar Tree Canada. Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher-value product, and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. The service level and in-stock position of basic products is increasing. The shopping experience continues to improve as our stores develop a more powerful seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. And through our investments in infrastructure, systems and training, we now have consistent year-on-year data on which to base our sales and assortment planning decisions. We see enormous potential in Canada. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 Dollar store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. Our goal is to be the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point.","Dollar Tree Direct, our online business, continues to expand. DTD provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores. We've expanded our online offering by 40% this year. Dollar Tree and Deal$ Direct now offer more than 3,800 items online, including more than 1,700 items in less than a case pack quantities. Traffic on the site exceeded 5.6 million unique visitors in the third quarter, a 25% increase over the third quarter last year. In addition, we now have more than 1 million Facebook fans and more than 1 million opt-in e-mail subscribers following our brand. We recently launched Christmas at the Tree on our site, showcasing our unique values for the holidays. I urge you to check it out at dollartree.com.","One of the keys to achieving consistent, profitable results has been our practice of building infrastructure and distribution capacity to support growth ahead of the need. You may remember in June of this year, we opened our new 1 million-square-foot distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut ahead of schedule. This new facility will provide capacity for growth in the Northeast and increase network efficiencies long-term. In addition to the new DC in Windsor, in the third quarter, as planned, we completed the expansion of our Marietta, Oklahoma DC to 1 million square feet. Both of these projects were under budget, and both were financed through available cash.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance. Kevin?","Kevin S. Wampler","Thanks, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share in the third quarter were $0.58. The increase resulted from our sales growth and a 10-basis-point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the second quarter last year.","Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 35% during the third quarter compared with 34.9% reported in the third quarter last year. Several factors contributed to this performance. The improvement was driven by higher initial markup across many categories and leverage on occupancy costs. The higher IMU reflects continued improvement in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model. The improvements were partially offset by increased distribution expenses as a percent of sales, reflecting the incremental expense associated with the ramp-up of our new DC in Windsor, Connecticut and maintaining a high level of service to stores as we realign DCs consistent with our added capacity.","SG&A expenses were 24.2% of sales for the quarter, unchanged from the third quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses declined by 30 basis points, as improved labor productivity and reduced expenses for stock compensation and retirement plan contributions offset a 17-basis-point increase in health insurance benefit expenses relative to the third quarter last year.","Operating expenses increased by 30 basis points. This was due principally to a 20-basis-point reduction in other income, reflecting the onetime realized gain of $3.8 million in the third quarter last year relating to the favorable resolution to a legal matter. In addition, store supplies and debit and credit card fees increased in the third quarter of the current year. Absent the onetime benefit from last year, SG&A would have improved 20 basis points for the quarter.","Operating income increased $20.2 million compared to the third quarter last year, and operating margin was 10.8%, an improvement of 10 basis points on top of the very strong 10.7% operating margin in the third quarter last year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, operating margin is 11.1%, an increase of 30 basis points from the same period last year.","The tax rate for the quarter was 36.9% compared with the third quarter last year at 36.3%.","Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled $147.1 million versus $222.4 million at the end of the third quarter 2012. In September, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. Under this new authorization, the company invested $1 billion for share repurchases through an accelerated share repurchase program that was launched on September 17. We received 15 million shares as part of the ASR during the third quarter. All additional shares repurchased under the ASR will be delivered to the company on or before June 2014. The ASR was funded by $250 million of cash and $750 million from the private placement of senior notes completed in September. Year-to-date through the third quarter, the company has invested $1.1 billion for share repurchase. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter was 217.6 million.","Our consolidated inventory at quarter-end was 9.2% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased 2.1%. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our fourth quarter sales initiatives.","Capital expenditures were $84.5 million in the third quarter of 2013 versus $96.6 million in the third quarter last year. For the full year, we are now planning consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $340 million. Capital expenditures this year are focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to over 590 stores, IT system enhancements, approximately $37 million towards the new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut and $25 million for the expansion of our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma and additional fee development store projects to be opened in 2014.","Depreciation and amortization was $48.6 million compared to $43.6 million in the third quarter last year. We expect depreciation expense of $190 million to $192 million for the year.","Our guidance for the remainder of 2013 include several assumptions. First, Halloween shifted back into the third quarter this year, reflecting the retail calendar. We believe that this moved approximately $5 million of revenue out of the fourth quarter and into the third quarter compared to last year. Comparable store sales are not impacted by this shift, as we aligned the comparable weeks in our comp store calculation.","Second, there are 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which presents a $25 million sales challenge in the fourth quarter; also, as you will remember, due to the retail calendar 2012 included 53 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 14 weeks. This extra week added $125 million of incremental sales and $0.08 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year last year.","Finally, our guidance assumes a tax rate of 37.7% for the fourth quarter and the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 209.1 million shares for the fourth quarter and 219.1 million shares for the full year. As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.","With this in mind, for the fourth quarter of 2013, we are forecasting sales in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.31 billion based on a low single-digit comparable store sales increase and 7% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.07, an increase of 8.6% to 17.2% compared with the fourth quarter last year, excluding the $0.08-per-share benefit from the extra week.","For the full fiscal year of 2013, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.86 billion to $7.92 billion based on a low single-digit increase in comparable store sales and 7% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.72 to $2.78. This would represent an increase of 11.5% to 13.9% over 2012 earnings per share of $2.44, which excludes the $0.08 benefit from the 53rd week and the $0.16 gain on an annualized basis from the sale of Ollie's in the third quarter of last year.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Kevin. Once again, I'm very pleased with our performance so far this year, and I'm excited about our future.","Sales year-to-date through the third quarter grew 8.9% to a record $5.6 billion, and comp store sales increased 2.9%, driven by a combination of increased consumer traffic and higher average ticket. Our operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 11.1%, the best performance in our history. And earnings per share increased by 13.1% to $1.73.","In addition, we continue to invest capital to support growth. This year, the company opened a new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut and expanded our distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma on time and under budget. We opened 292 new stores across the U.S. and Canada, and we expanded frozen and refrigerated product to 566 additional stores, more than any previous year.","During the third quarter, Dollar Tree celebrated its 27th anniversary. Through those years, we've grown steadily, built solid infrastructure, evolved from small stores to larger stores with broad assortments and reinvented ourselves continuously, yet we have remained true to our original concept. Everything is still $1 at Dollar Tree stores in the U.S. The Dollar Tree business model is powerful and flexible. It's been tested by time and validated by history. And I believe that Dollar Tree can do even better in the future. There's much more opportunity ahead of us than behind us. Our strategic plan involves multiple platforms for growth. There's a great opportunity to grow and expand the Dollar Tree brand in the U.S. through more stores and better stores. The Deal$ brand is positioned for growth, serving more customers with more categories. Dollar Tree Canada is positioned for profitable expansion in the years ahead, and Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach to new customers throughout North America.","We have plenty of opportunities to grow our business, a vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen while generating substantial free cash. And we continue to manage our capital for the benefit of long-term shareholders.","During the third quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program, under which $1 billion has already been invested through an accelerated share purchase plan -- share repurchase plan.","I'm proud of our consistent strong performance. I'm even more proud of our Dollar Tree associates from every department in the company, who work hard to deliver on our promise of great-value merchandise and stores that are full, fun and friendly for every customer every day.","It's an exciting time at Dollar Tree. As we enter the fourth quarter, our shelves are full of the right product for Thanksgiving and the holiday season. Our stock rooms are in great shape, and our merchandise values have never been higher.","We will now address your questions. So that we can accommodate as many callers as time permits [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a little bit more detail on the comp trajectory. I think that last year, you had noted better trends throughout the quarter, and you just mentioned October was the strongest. So maybe if you can provide a little more detail on what you saw as the quarter progressed, perhaps highlighting any changes in the traffic and ticket or categories.","Bob Sasser","Well, Stephen, I'll try to give you a little color on the quarter. As I already said, all 3 months were comp positive. All zones in the company were comp positive. It was led by the Midwest and the Southeast and Southwest, but it's pretty close. Both consumable and our variety merchandise was comp positive, with the variety merchandise growing a bit faster than consumables, and that's similar to the trend that we saw in the second quarter. We had a great back-to-school. It was one of the best on record. Our top categories during the back-to-school period were our office supplies and writing and our teaching tree, which is our classroom supplies, our binders and our paper products. We came directly out of back-to-school and into Halloween and harvest and fall, and we were set with all of that by September 6. Our stores just did a terrific job of turning it around from back-to-school fronts of the stores to those seasonal categories that were Halloween, harvest and fall. They did again with an exceptional job of converting on October 31, the night of -- the evening of October 31, our stores converted to Thanksgiving and Christmas, so that when we opened up on November 1, we were ready for those new holidays. Other notables, our checkout and front-end impulse lane led the company in comp increases. That initiative has begun last fall. It's been very successful. Our checkouts were followed by frozen and refrigerated. As I said, we rolled out more stores with frozen and refrigerated in the third quarter, followed by stationery and party and cards. So that gives you a little color on the quarter, where the seasons were dynamic, very good, I would say. The customer traffic was attributed to all of the comp store sales increases, so customer traffic was very good. We're getting new customers all the time. They seem to be shopping a little later for their needs and maybe a little more often and getting a few new customers in that regard. So very consistent across the quarter, I think, is the way I would characterize the business.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. It sounds like there's not a lot of deviation. And then changing gears a little bit, as you think about the ASR and what's left there and then the future buybacks, any additional clarity you can give in terms of the timing of deploying that?","Kevin S. Wampler","Yes, Stephen, I think as -- obviously, the ASR that we've put in place in September is really just kind of in its infancy. I mean, the transaction can last as long as mid-June of next year. So that's in place. In September, we received about 15 million shares. There will be a settlement at some point between the minimum timeframe of the contract and the maximum timeframe of the contract. And again, that can go, as we said, until mid-June of next year. So basically, that's in place. We look at our -- as we look at our capital structure and our capital allocation each and every year, we have looked at share repurchase as being a good return of value to our shareholders, our long-term shareholders. But really, between now and the end of the ASR, there will not be anything additional per se. But obviously, that still leaves time later in the year that we'll be able to give consideration as to what direction we want to move.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you speak to trends in the quarter on the non-food, more discretionary side? And did you see momentum that you see in October, did you see that continue into November?","Bob Sasser","It's too early to say about the November. We're only a couple weeks into it. And with that shift in the Thanksgiving holiday, as Thanksgiving's a week later this year, it's hard to say what the trends are right now. We're -- it's all in our guidance, and we're running a little bit ahead of our forecast, but it's all cloudy by Thanksgiving. But the trends, both of our -- both the consumable categories and non-consumable categories grew in the third quarter, and it was very similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. Actually, it was our plan. We have driven our variety business with our front end and our impulse and our stationery initiatives and our party initiatives. Our goal is to always have a balanced assortment of things you need and things you want. Over the last several years, the consumable categories have grown a little faster, really attributable to 2 things. One, the nature of the economy, more people needing more the consumable product and seeing Dollar Tree as the place to shop. They continue to do that. But also the -- we rolled out more consumable product over the last several years. So what you saw beginning in Q2 this year was a little bit of a shift, with the non-consumables growing a bit faster than the consumables. But both categories of goods grew, and I'm very pleased with that. I'm especially pleased with the shopping experience that, that offers the customer. It's about the balanced mix to manage our margins. We've been very successful for 27 years managing our margins within a tight range because we are always looking for that balanced mix of needs-based, as well as variety merchandise. And so our initiatives that we rolled out last year, we're seeing the results of that. We're seeing the front end and the impulse and the checkout categories grow, again, a great back-to-school with stationery growing, our party business is very healthy and growing. And all the while, we still continue to roll out frozen and refrigerated. We still continue to focus on the needs-based businesses, and our traffic is up.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then on the margin front, what are you seeing on the sourcing front today and any early thoughts on IMU into the spring?","Bob Sasser","Well, as far as margin, we're -- I've always said, we're in control of that. As far as sourcing, we go to market with 2 things in mind, and one is to offer the greatest value for the dollar at a margin that we're willing to accept. There is always pressure on commodities up and down. They move around a little bit. The most recent trip to Asia I did not go on, I've already been to 3 this year, so I decided not to make the October trip. But reports from Asia were that everything is just fine. Again, we buy in U.S. dollars, we don't buy in the foreign currency, and we negotiate a price based on our buying power, based on our needs and based on our relationships that is within our margin range. So I'm always pretty comfortable in that margin. I've always said, it's all about the mix of product at Dollar Tree that we sell as much as cost changes because we manage the cost changes very well. We follow the mix. Sometimes, customers are demanding more of the consumer products which are a little lower margin, sometimes a little more discretionary products, which is higher margin. And again, we're sort of balancing that every quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","At the Analyst Meeting, you talked quite a bit, I think, about the 6 days less between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and you talked about how successful Easter was in making up timing shortfalls there. And you seemed very optimistic about not being able to make up that $25 million during the holidays. Any change in that view now?","Bob Sasser","Meredith, we're always -- we knew there was going to be 6 less days. We planned accordingly, and we're never victims. We always plan to make up. We have terrific plans, and you saw some of them at the Analyst Day. We have terrific plans for the fourth quarter. We have the best seasonal assortment that we've ever had. We're going to deliver that, as we've already begun that with setting it up in our stores. It's absolutely the best merchandise assortment. The execution has been terrific so far. I don't expect that to change, so there's nothing inherent in the business different as far as how we execute, how we run, how we buy, how we deliver, how we run our stores. There's nothing new out there. I have great confidence in that. We are still subject to -- it is still 6 less days, we're subject to all the things that we didn't know at the time, with the pressure on the consumer, which consumers are under pressure right now. And I predict that we will have customers in our stores, we'll get our share, and I predict we're going to have a very good holiday season. That's all included in our guidance.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And the Street, I think, had a higher expectation for comps this quarter in part because comparison was very easy. Can you tell us whether comps met your expectations for the quarter?","Bob Sasser","Well, we're always looking for, Meredith, as much as we can get. And I will tell you, comps are never easy, it's always about execution, it's always about looking at what you've done and then putting your hands on the -- finger on the pulse of the consumer and managing the business accordingly. I am pleased with our third quarter results. Our revenue grew 9.5%. We had a 3.1% comp. That's -- on that, we'd leveraged -- we had the highest third quarter operating margin in our history at 10.8%, a 13.7% increase in earnings per share, so the results were very good. And I will tell you, it was done during a very difficult environment. And again, some of this, we've known and we've been experiencing, like high unemployment, and it's still high, and the customers are still burdened and concerned and -- about that, higher taxes on the middle class this whole year. Recently, the reduction in food stamp benefits puts more pressure on the low income consumers. There's also the fear of the -- what's going on with health care, and it's -- you turn on the TV or pick up a newspaper, and that's all you see. And the end result of that is a weak consumer confidence. And the third quarter, I think, was the lowest in 2 years or about 2 years, as I read the news. So consumers are cautious, and we have a cautious consumer and a somewhat shortened shopping season. I think that's magnified when you have those short seasons. So our job, Meredith, is to be part of the solution by offering the high-value merchandise and a great shopping experience. We did that extremely well in the third quarter, in a tough time, traffic was up. And as a result, our revenues, our profits hit a record high. We feel very confident about what we can control in the fourth quarter. I'm very excited about the fourth quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you elaborate a little bit more on the fee development program and the kind of capital commitment we'll see there?","Kevin S. Wampler","Sure, Denise. We've started doing some fee development deals a couple years ago, and I think it's something that some of the other people in the discount value space have been doing for a while. But traditionally, we've had plenty of space available through traditional leasing available to us. As we went through the economic downturn, some of the developers became more capital challenged, and there were not as many new spaces coming out of the ground. So we looked at it as an opportunity. We obviously have the capital to deploy accordingly. So we've kind of stuck our toe in the water, and we're starting to build that program. And I think what we like about it is the fact that what we've seen so far is that the performance of the ones we have opened has actually exceeded our expectations. They've done very well. And so I think part of that is about getting not only a good location front and center, but it's also about building a store that's exactly what we want it to look like. When we can build a store that's 100 by 100 or 80 by 120, and it lays out well from us from a linear space perspective and lays out well from a merchandising perspective, it makes us that much more efficient, and it just plays well to the consumer. So we got a lot of success from that perspective. We're going to continue to build it. From an overall capital allocation perspective, we're going to continue to grow, I mean, I think this year, as we talked about our capital, our CapEx was a little bit higher. We raised it. We've given a range of $320 million to $330 million. We've bumped that to $340 million, so we got about additional $10 million that we've put towards it this year, above and beyond what we had originally allocated, which is closer to $30 million. And then so for 2014, we haven't given numbers. We'll probably look to bump that potentially a little bit more since we have the opportunity. But it's a program we're building. But the majority of our stores are still going to be through the traditional leasing method, but it does give us another avenue for growth.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And just a follow-up here, could you please quantify the distribution deleverage from the new DC? Was it similar to the last quarter? Because what I'm trying to get at really with your very strong gross margin is, what was the basis point shift between consumables and discretionary?","Bob Sasser","The -- we shifted 70 to 80 basis points more discretionary versus consumables during the quarter and...","Kevin S. Wampler","And in regards to the distribution cost, it was similar to Q2 basically from how it delevered, but -- so again, that's part of getting that store up online -- or that DC up online, full operation, and it does not have a full load of stores today that it will at some point in the future. But it's gone very, very well. It's obviously very important to us up in the Northeast. We've had a lot of growth up there, so it's very important to us. And so it gives us a lot of opportunities as we go forward.","Bob Sasser","Denise, it's Bob. On that 80 -- 70 to 80 basis points, that's as a percentage of mix shift, that's not margin. That's about 70 to 80 basis points more percentage of total in the discretionary versus the nondiscretionary.","Operator","And we'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Given the acceleration we've seen in terms of the cooler rollouts going in the stores in the comp base, I guess I'm a little surprised consumables didn't grow faster. Anything you can point to that maybe adversely impacted the consumables growth in that quarter -- in the quarter? And related to that, do you think you're still gaining the same kind of sales lift as what you once saw earlier in the rollout process?","Bob Sasser","Well, we had a good rollout. We rolled out -- we've rolled out a lot of new stores -- cooler stores this year and again in the third quarter. And the stores that we rolled out in the third quarter, we had higher comps in those stores than in the non-freezer stores, which is as we would expect. We had higher traffic. The average ticket on the rollout is a little slightly down but just a little bit. And I think that's to be expected with -- as you roll these out, consumers typically give you a try first, and then they respond if they like it. So I think that's what we're seeing with as many cooler rollouts as we've had. By the way, we had in those stores that we rolled out the new cooler program, we saw a lift across all category, both discretionary and nondiscretionary. So it's doing what we expect it to do. We've always said that the frozen and refrigerated, the mission of that is to satisfy the customer and drive more traffic and more frequent purchases, and that's exactly what we're seeing as we roll out these new cooler stores. And just to the point there, so I'm not disappointed in our growth in our consumable business. It's growing, too. Both categories are growing. We always said that we're looking for that balanced mix of sales in things you need and things you want. And as one grows a little faster, we're always pushing on the other side to grow that a little faster. And I think that's what we're seeing the result of, those initiatives that we kicked off last year in stationery, in our front end, in our party business and our seasonal business, they're working, and they're growing faster because we've put a lot more emphasis, we've expanded the assortment, we've expanded the inventory, we've reviewed our signing, we've really increased the focus on our stores on execution in those categories. So our consumer business is still comping year over year over year. It's just that the discretionary business -- it all has to add up to 100, by the way, and the discretionary business is growing a little faster now, and that's healthy. That turns into better operating margin.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it, and that's very helpful, Bob. And then, Kevin, can I just clarify something you said regarding SG&A. You gave us a bunch of give-and-takes. Did you say SG&A would have leveraged 20 basis points on kind of an apples-to-apples basis?","Kevin S. Wampler","That's correct. So remember, last year, we had a benefit from a legal settlement of -- and it was equated to about 20 basis points. So that was a headwind, basically, for this quarter. So without it, we would have leveraged 20 basis points.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The increased promotional activity at other multiple price point discounters how is that -- how do you think that's impacting Dollar Tree? And how do you respond given your commitment to that $1 price point?","Bob Sasser","Dan, it's -- I feel exactly the way I've always felt that our success is really driven on focusing on the customer and doing what we do best. Other retailers, I respect them all highly. They have a model that run -- that they run their business by, that may include price promotions, that might include more advertising and the like. We really don't, and, actually, I like to see more customers out shopping as early as possible. And if I can relocate our stores where middle America lives and shops and if we can get some of the traffic into our stores when customers are out shopping, we think we can get our share of that. We're focused on everything's $1, we're focused on value for our customers and running great stores. And we watch what competitors do. We're knowledgeable about what's going on in the industry. But at the end of the day, our success is going to be driven on how well we execute on our plan, and that's what we continue to stay focused on. I think we're still dead center in the crosshairs of what consumers are needing. We have that balanced mix of things you need, things you want, and everything is still $1, and the excitement around going into one of our stores and everything being $1 and finding something that you didn't expect is still evident in our customers.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","It's also a question about Canada. You reminded us you still see 1,000 store opportunities. I believe you also indicated new store productivity in Canada is probably not where you wanted to be. Can you talk about what's working in Canada and what's not working compared to where you thought a couple years ago?","Bob Sasser","Yes, and some of the enthusiasm I have over Canada is exactly that, the opportunity to improve the productivity of the stores. We opened 36 stores this year through Q3 in Canada, and we ended with 176 stores. That's about 26% so far. We've more than doubled the size since we bought the Canadian stores in, what, late 2010. All of our stores have now been re-bannered. We've finished that this year. So they're all Dollar Tree Canada, all except for maybe -- you may find a handful of small stores that we didn't re-banner because we're probably looking to expand those stores anyway. Service level and our in-stock position on merchandise is improving. The shopping experience continues to improve as the stores develop more seasonal presence. By the way, we're now ready for the holidays in Canada. The stores, if you walked into a Dollar Tree Canada store, you'll see a lot of the same excitement and enthusiasm in the merchandise mix. We've made a lot of investments so far, investments in infrastructure and systems and training. And we now have consistent year-over-year data, which we can use to base our sales and assortment planning decisions on. So that's working. I'm very proud of the Canadian team, I'm proud of, really, members on both sides of the border and all that they've done. The opportunity in Canada is still as great as we saw in the beginning. And I'm really pleased with where we're coming, but we do have opportunity to increase our -- not only our store count but the productivity of new stores and the productivity of existing stores through merchandise and merchandising.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, just a follow-up real quickly then, if I could, just is it -- Dollarama is proving to be a more formidable competitor? Or is it on the items above $1 that you're carrying in Canada, perhaps, are not as relevant, not as value-added?","Bob Sasser","It's more us again -- and Dollarama, by the way, is a nice company. We've always admired what they've done there. Their financials are terrific, and, frankly, I view that as it's there to be done. But the -- just think about all we've changed since we bought the company, we've changed every part of the mix, we've changed new people, we've got new systems, we've got new processes, we've gotten rid of old merchandise that was part of the old assortment, we've pushed in new merchandise as part of a new assortment, we've put in POS and -- systems and new logistics and all the things that we've done, it's really been a period of investment and invention and building of the history in order to take advantage of it. So it's still us. I mean, no matter what you say, there's good competitors everywhere, and Dollarama is indeed one, but the Canadian customers love what we do. And there's something special about everything in the store is $1.25. We're the largest at the single price point. We want to -- that's the niche that we want to own, as everything is one price, everything is a great value. You find the things that you need. And by the way, when you shop in the stores, you find things you didn't expect, it was only CAD 1.25.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Joan Storms with Wedbush Securities.","Joan L. Bogucki-Storms - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I have -- just want to dive a little bit deeper into the SG&A line. Were there unusual expenses in the third quarter? For example, on the -- Kevin, I think you had cited the increase in health care or health insurance, and then operating expenses were also up and anything -- and then also the store supplies and professional fees. Was there anything unusual there that you might have been able to lever on that comp?","Kevin S. Wampler","Well, I would tell you, so we've talked to each of those, Joan. If we look at, for example, debit and credit fees, a year ago in Q4, we rolled out MasterCard to the rest of our stores. It had been in about 1,000 stores when we rolled it to the rest of the chain. What we've seen since then is our credit card business has grown by about 2.5%. It actually grew by 2.7% in Q3. So we'll actually anniversary that coming into Q4 here. So obviously, a bigger percentage of our business is being done in card business. We're up to, combined between debit and credit, a little over 40% of our business is now there. It wasn't all that long ago when it was about 1\/3, so it's grown and continues to grow. So -- and again, so that's something we could -- we have to pay our processors at the end of the day, so that's up. As we look at things like health insurance, our health insurance was a pretty big headwind in the quarter, in the sense we're up 17 basis points. And our health insurance, we're self-insured. And basically, we've just had a lot of large claims this year. I've been doing this long enough to know that every once in a while, you have a year like that, where things just seem to come in one after another. And -- but that's just the way it is, it's self-insured, we pay it, and we'll go down the road and understand that it just seems to be an unusual year for us from a natural claims point of view. It's not like there's anything related to the Affordable Care Act per se or anything like that, that's part of that. It's really just the normal course of business. In store supplies, I think a little bit of it is just a little bit of new fixturing and a little bit of getting ready for the holiday season with bags. Probably our biggest expense overall in store supplies in any given year is the bags we use in our stores for customers to carry product out in, and then costs have been just slightly higher this year, and those get allocated as we get them shipped to the stores. So I think that's a little bit of that at the end of the day. So those are just some of the things that we saw during the quarter. And then as we -- as per Scot's question, I think it was the idea, the fact that we had the benefit last year, 20-basis-point benefit last year, so that was an automatic headwind heading into the quarter.","Joan L. Bogucki-Storms - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then any guidance? Obviously, we had the 53rd week last year, you had a higher sales, plus you had higher SG&A. Anything abnormal in that SG&A from last year that you could point out?","Kevin S. Wampler","Nothing that comes to mind at the end of the day. Obviously, you're right, from a comparability, it's not comparable going into the -- our guidance compared to that. I mean, the big thing is, obviously, the extra week of sales. And the biggest effect there is in the occupancy line because, basically, you have 12 months of expense in each year, but the one year, you get that extra $125 million. So we'll see significant deleveraging year-over-year in the fourth quarter because of the occupancy costs up in gross profit. So that will be there, and we know that's there, but that's obviously all built into our guidance at the end of the day.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","A question on your category management. You've done a lot this year to try and expand the categories that have been growing nicely. I'm just curious, as you look ahead, do you see any emerging categories that you think are worth adding to the store? Or is there any further tweaking of categories in the store not necessarily for holiday but as we go into next year?","Bob Sasser","Yes, Dan, it's -- there's really nothing -- no new categories. We're going to continue as we go forward to roll out our frozen and refrigerated as we open new stores and as we find existing stores that meet the criteria. So that's an initiative that's ongoing. There's still room to continue to roll those out. We are looking at our variety experience as we go forward, not just more categories or even necessarily more space, but just that excitement around seasonal, that excitement around tween business, that excitement around our party and all of the events. We really want to own these holidays. So as we'd look at the layouts of our stores, as we'd look at the merchandise flows, we're doing a lot of work around continuing to maximize sales and earnings through that variety experience because those categories aren't -- they're margin, but they're also the excitement, they're part of the reason that you shop at Dollar Tree. You're buying things you didn't expect. They -- we speak of the seasons as changing like the leaves on the trees. And so we really have focused on execution, changing out from one season to the next quickly, really starting with that new seasonal impact early on in the season and how we display that and how we're going to sign that, how we're going to merchandise that. So it's really more of those kinds of things than it is 1 more skew or 4 more pieces of these or a new category.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","My follow-up question is not related to merchandising but a separate question on cannibalization. I know you guys have focused on that in the past at the different analyst meetings you've hosted. Just curious, so are you seeing anything in terms of changes in self cannibalization? In other words, with new store productivity good but comp is a little softer, do you think that some of your comp stores are being affected by the new store openings?","Kevin S. Wampler","Dan, as we have a financial planning and analysis group that works hand in hand with our real estate group, as we've built our models over the year not only in the way we build our pro forma sales models but also cannibalization model, and they've worked. And our models have proven to be very accurate at the end of the day. And -- but we really haven't seen any significant difference in the cannibalization levels. And I think what we've found is that, actually, we can put stores a little bit closer together than maybe we thought in the past based upon the various inputs into the model. So I think realistically, if anything, we've proven that we can dense up markets, we can shift into build out marketplaces with more stores and really do just fine. And part of our analysis when we're looking at opening new stores is really not only an individual store return, which is with our hurdle rates for individual stores on return on invested capital, but then there's also hurdle rates as it relates to the market ROIC. So if we're going into a marketplace, we know we're going to have some cannibalization, we'll actually look at the market ROIC as well and verify that it meets a level that we're very satisfied with as we look at how we deploy our capital. So that's kind of the way we're looking at it right now.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in our business. Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for 2014.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ material from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K, all of which are on file with the SEC.

At the end of our planned remarks we will open the call to your questions. (Operator Instructions).","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, CEO of Dollar Tree. Bob?","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Tim and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Our comp store sales increased 1.2% as a result of equal growth in both traffic and ticket. Net sales were $2.235 billion and earnings were a record $1.02 per diluted share comparing the 13 week fourth quarter in 2013 against the 14 week fourth quarter in 2012 this represents a 1% increase.","On a comparative three week basis quarterly earnings increased 9.7%. For the full year 2013 comp store sales increased 2.4% largely as a result of increased traffic. Net sales grew to $7.84 billion and earnings for the full year were record $2.72 per share. The improvements in 2013 were achieved on top of record 2012 results that included $60 million of income from the sale of Ollie\u2019s and 125 million incremental sales from the 53rd week last year.","The combined benefit of these two events accounted for $0.24 earnings per share in 2012 and of course we did not have those two events in our results for 2013. It was a challenging quarter best characterized as a short selling season and persistently bad weather. Because of these unusual events I am going to give you a little more color in detail on the quarter than I normally give. We had a great plan that was well executed when the stores were opened and the customers could shop our results were more accurately reflective of the underlying strength of our business. In November, I will remind you that we had two calendar shifts that negatively affected results.","This year Halloween sales moved out of November and out of fourth quarter and back to third quarter and Thanksgiving moved a week later. As a result, we lost six selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. These two calendar shifts combined represented a $30 million sales challenge to fourth quarter and specifically to November. With the Thanksgiving shift as expected comp sales were lowest in November but above our plan as we were able to offset some of the impacts of the calendar shifts through merchandising initiatives.","Moving forward in the quarter, a succession of major winter storms impacted significant portions of North America beginning the week of Thanksgiving and continued throughout January. To add some color, out of the full 91 days in the quarter 33 days were negatively affected by winter storms that forced a large number of store closures were partial openings and even larger number of stores that opened but sales were negatively impacted by the poor conditions.","In December, more than 700 store selling days were negatively impacted by store closures in spite of this December was our strongest month of the quarter. Comp sales grew nearly 4% in December and we would have done better if not for the days lost to the winter storms. I am extremely proud of our store team who worked tirelessly to adjust to the lost days and provide a great seasonal presentation and outstanding execution throughout the holidays.","In January the pattern of severe weather continued the number of store selling days negatively impacted by store closures increased from more than 700 in December to more than 2,000 store selling days in January almost triple. Inspire of this, January comp store sales were still slightly positive. When you look at the weather by region as you would expect the best performance was in the Southeast followed closely by the Southwest.","However, even in the Southern regions we were impacted, I am sure everyone saw TV coverage of the weather disruption in Dallas, Atlanta, Charlotte, Rowley and other Southern cities as winter storms caused power outages and created havoc on the highways. As you would expect the lowest comp sales performance was in the Midwest and in the Northeast as these areas were the hardest hit by the winter storms.","Reflecting continuing success of strategies that were implemented earlier in the year top performing categories in the quarter were our checkout and impulse department, frozen and refrigerated products, stationary, candy and party supplies. The holiday promotional plan was tightly coordinated and well executed in November our stores transitioned quickly from Halloween to Christmas.","The store teams worked late on the evening of October 31st to make sure the store fronts showed at Thanksgiving and Christmas upon opening for business November 1st. Our Wow Table at the front of the store was focused each week on basic needs for the holidays, these were things key items like full pants, turkey basters and floor mats.","INCAT were built to promote catering, food storage, kitchen gadgets and seasonal baking needs. Our fall lease Tabletop promotion including glassware, dinnerware, napkins and placemats was a big hit and an early sale out in many of our stores. Christmas D\u00e9cor was set to promote early sales with a selling season compressed by the calendar shift we wanted to exploit the early opportunity.","In an early December right after Thanksgiving our Wow Table was again focused on tabletop with beautiful holiday dinnerware, glassware, stemware, charger place, table runners and placemats everything to set the best holiday table imaginable. The product was picture perfect and of course everything was just well.","A new event was created for December called the last 10 days the idea was to bring all the last minute categories together and remerchandize the front of the store with the purpose. With the short holiday season the intention was to make sure our customers\u2019 needs were met at all times the last 10 days event focused on wrap it, box it and bag it. Our seasonal wall converted to Christmas give bag headquarters with everything you need to bag that perfect gift including the related tie-ins like tags and tissue.","Major displays of roll wrap, gift boxes, bows, tags, tape and scissors were merchandized upfront along with the novelty boxes, cookie tins and gift jars. Last minute guests were all grouped together and our stocking staff at toy selection rounded out the effort. Displays were full fun exciting and relevant to our customers\u2019 needs and our customers responded favorably. I am especially pleased with our inventory management this year and in the fourth quarter with 231 more stores at year end combined with the sales challenges of the fourth quarter we ended the year with less average inventory per store than last year.","Through the superb efforts of our merchants and logistics teams the inventory was appropriately allocated replenished and delivered to the stores. As a result, our seasonal sell-through was good, our basic in-stock was maintained and when the customers were out shopping our stores were ready. We started fiscal 2014 on plan with clean inventories well prepared to support new store openings and sales plans in the first quarter.","In addition to inventory management I am very pleased with expense management in the fourth quarter. SG&A expenses fell in the quarter from 21.7% to 21.3%. Much of this was accomplished by the terrific performance of store operations through initiatives focused on freight productivity and keeping the sales forward full, proper scheduling to the needs of the customer and emphasis on properly recovering the store every day and against the top sales backdrop including three major resets of the front of the store, the store teams were able to increase productivity, improve store conditions and improve the customer experience.","This quarterly performance speaks to the value and relevance of our merchandise the power strength and flexibility of our model and a day by day execution of our strategy across the organization. Despite challenges we grew top line sales, we grew comp store sales and we grew earnings per share. Looking forward, we\u2019re positioned to continue relevance to the customer sustained growth and increased profitability. We have room to grow and the ability to grow in many different ways by opening more stores, by opening better more productive stores, by increasing the productivity of all stores and developing new formats, new markets and new channels as growth vehicles. During the fourth quarter of this year we opened 51 new stores and relocated and expanded another four stores.","For the full year of 2013 we added 343 new stores and expanded or relocated 71 existing stores for a total of 414 projects. Selling square footage increased 6.9% and we ended the quarter with 4,992 stores. For the full year 2014 our plan includes approximately 375 new stores and 75 relocations for a total 450 projects across the US and Canada. Square footage is planned to increase 7% over fiscal 2013.","In addition to opening more stores we have plans to open better and more productive stores, this has been the result of the coordinated process, concentrating on improved site selection, rightsizing our stores, expanding our assortments improve staffing and building the bench of qualified store management. In 2012, new store productivity reached its highest level since 2001. Our 2013 class came in slightly below last year but historically strong we believe the stores that we opened in Q4 especially the ones affected by the winter storms will continue to annualize at a higher sales per foot as we continue through the year.","Elements of the strategy to increase the store productivity can be seen throughout the chain. In recent quarters we have described some of our category specific initiatives to drive sales. In all stores customers are seeing more powerful seasonal and party presentations. We continue to rationalize and expand assortments across a chain of stationary, candy, health and beauty care and home and household products.","Store associates are emphasizing more effective customer engagement and working to drive sales of related items through a cross merchandizing and through suggestive selling and we\u2019re rolling out freezers and coolers at a faster pace. In the fourth quarter we installed freezers and coolers in 42 additional stores, for a total of 608 store installations for the year and exceeding our plan. We now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 3,157 stores. This year we intend to add freezers and coolers to 320 additional stores and to expand the size of the department in 50 existing frozen and refrigerated stores.","This category serves the current needs of our customers, drives traffic into our stores and provides incremental sales across all categories including our higher margin discretionary products. Another key component of our growth strategy is the expansion of deals Dollar Tree Canada and Dollar Tree Direct.","Our deals format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal stores delivered low prices on everyday essentials party goods, seasonal and home product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price pointed deals we\u2019re able to serve more customers, with more products at value prices every day.","Consistent with our plan, we opened 29 new deal stores in 2013 including four new stores in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with the net total of 214 deal stores. Our Canadian integration and expansion continues we opened 41 new Dollar Tree Canada stores in 2013 including five new stores in the fourth quarter ending the year with the 180 stores in Canada. Store count grew by almost 29% for the year slightly more than our stated plan of 25%.","Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree our merchants are sourcing higher value products and our Canadian customers are finding broader more exciting assortments and better values in the stores, we see enormous potential in Canada as we grow and improve we believe the Canadian market can support up to a 1,000 Dollar Tree stores.","This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States plus additional growth in our deals format. Our goal is to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25 just as we are in the US at the $1 price.","Adding to our growth strategy Dollar Tree Direct our e-commerce business is expanding rapidly, Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores. Some key milestones achieved in 2013 included 20% growth in the site traffic which exceeded 6 million unique visitors in the fourth quarter.","This includes a 67% increase in customer traffic via mobile devices during the fourth quarter. Dollar Tree Direct and Deals Direct now have over 3,800 items available online including more than 1,700 unique items that can be purchased in less than case quantities an increase of 50% versus the same time last year.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Kevin who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance.","Kevin Wampler","Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned the company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.02 for the fourth quarter of 2013 this represented a 1% increase versus the 14 week fourth quarter of 2012 and a 9.7% increase on a comparative 13 week basis. As we look at the income statement please keep in mind that the extra week in the fourth quarter of last year contributed $125 million of sales and about $0.08 to earnings per share to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Our gross profit margin was 36.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with 37.9% in the fourth quarter of last year. Substantially all of the decrease was driven by occupancy and distribution expenses reflecting the loss of the benefit of the extra week of sales last year, lower leverage from a 1.2% comp and the incremental expense associated with the ramp up of our new DC in Windsor, Connecticut while maintaining a high level of service to the stores as we realigned DCs consistent with our added capacity.","Merchandise margin was similar to the same period last year driven by continued improvements in initial mark-up reflecting a 60 basis points shift towards discretionary products and continued improvements in sourcing. These improvements were partially offset by 10 basis points increase in shrink expense which remained the low 2% of sales.","SG&A expense was 21.3% of sales for the quarter compared with 21.7% reported in the fourth quarter of last year. Payroll related expenses declined by approximately 50 basis points due to lower expenses were performance based, incentive compensation and retirement plan contributions as well as improved store labor productivity compared with the last year. Operating and corporate expenses increased by 5 basis points driven by higher utility costs and depreciation increased 10 basis points primarily reflecting the impact of the extra week last year.","Operating income of $348.2 million in the fourth quarter was $15.3 million less than a record $363.5 million in operating income for the 14 week fourth quarter last year. Operating margin was 15.6% compared with operating margin of 16.2% in the fourth quarter of last year which included a 40 basis points benefit from the extra week. For the full year of 2013 operating income $50.2 million and our operating margin was 12.4% compared with 12.4% last year.","The tax rate for the quarter was 37.2% versus 37% in the fourth quarter last year for the full fiscal year the tax rate was 37.5% compared with 36.7% in 2012.","Looking at the balance sheet and statement cash flow, cash and cash equivalents at year end totaled $267.7 million versus $399.9 million at the end of fiscal 2012. During 2013, we invested $1.1 billion for share repurchase including a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, as you may recall in September the Board of Directors authorized a 2 billion share repurchase program, under the new authorization the company invested 1 billion for share repurchased through the accelerated share repurchase program that was launched on September 17th.","The ASR was funded by $250 million of available cash and $750 million from a private placement of senior notes completed in September. We received 15 million shares as part of the ASR in 2013 all during the third quarter no shares were delivered in the fourth quarter. All additional shares repurchased under the ASR will be delivered to the company on or before June 2014.","The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 209.3 million we will update you on any additional shares delivered as part of the ASR when we will report results for the first quarter. Our consolidated inventory at year end was 6.6% greater than at the end same time last year while selling square footage increased 6.9%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 0.3% this includes inventory on the water and in our distribution centers relating to the later Easter our spring fling promotion and our first quarter store openings.","We entered 2014 with liner store level inventory than last year reflecting our inventory management plan. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings in our first quarter sales initiatives.","Capital expenditures were $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 this compared with 75.5 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year of 2013 capital expenditures were $330.1 million compared with $312.2 million in 2012. For 2014 we\u2019re planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels including additional fee development stores.","The addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancements the expansion of our Joliet, Illinois distribution center and the beginning phases of work on our 11th distribution center.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $50.3 million for the fourth quarter versus $46.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year depreciation was at $190.7 million a 5 basis points increase from the last year, where 2014 depreciation and amortization is estimated to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million. Our guidance for 2014 includes the following assumptions first in regards to freight expense, we will soon be negotiating new ocean rates that become effective on May 1st. As always we cannot predict the outcome of those negotiations, nor can anyone accurately predict the direction of these appraisals for the next year.","For this reason, our guidance assumes that ocean freight rates and diesel prices will be similar to the current levels on average throughout fiscal 2014. Second Easter is three weeks later this year, this represents an $8 million sales opportunity in the first quarter.","Also as we look ahead to the fourth quarter this year there is one additional selling day between Thanksgiving and Christmas which returns us to a more normal pattern than last year. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 38.2% for the full year weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 207.9 million shares for the first quarter and 206.7 million shares for the full year.","While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase other than the expected completion of share deliveries related to the ASR. With that in mind for the first quarter of 2014 we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.98 billion to $2.04 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.63 to $0.68 which would represent a 9% to 17% increase compared to the first quarter of 2013 earnings of $0.58 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low single digit comparable store sales increase and 6.7% square footage growth.","For the full year of 2014 we are forecasting sales in the range of $8.35 billion to $8.58 billion based on a low single digit increase in comparable store sales and 7% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $2.91 to $3.13 this represents an increase of 7% to 15% over 2013 earnings per share of $2.72.","With that I will turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Kevin. In summary, during 2013 our comp store sales increased 2.4% and total sales grew 6% to a record $7.8 billion. We achieved 12.4% operating margin and earnings per share increased to $2.72. 2013 was a year of great accomplishments we opened 343 new stores in 2013 expanded relocated 71 stores and ended the year with 4,992 stores and square footage growth of 6.9%.","We expanded frozen and refrigerated products to 608 stores for a total 3,157 stores across the US. We opened a new 1 million square foot fully automated distribution center in Windsor Connecticut ahead of schedule and under budget and expanded capacity to other DCs San Bernardino, California and Marietta Oklahoma. As we entered our 28th year Dollar Tree can be proud of its record of steady growth and continuous reinvention while maintaining and remaining true to our core concept everything is still at Dollar Tree stores in the US.","The Dollar Tree business model is powerful and flexible, it\u2019s been tested by time and validated by history. The Dollar Tree model is now more relevant than ever providing extreme value to customers while recording record level of earnings customers know that even in a difficult economy at Dollar Tree you could still splurge everything is only at Dollar. We saw plenty of evidence of this in the fourth quarter with worst winter weather in decades our traffic was up when people were out shopping that came to Dollar Tree.","I believe that Dollar Tree can do even better in the future and there is much more opportunity ahead of us than behind us we have multiple platforms for growth as we focus on serving the customer on our plans to grow and expand the Dollar Tree brand in the US through more stores and better stores. The deals brand to serving more customers with more categories. Dollar Tree Canada is positioned for profitable expansion in the new geography and Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its search and its reach to new customers throughout North America.","We have plenty of opportunities to grow our business, a vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen while generating substantial free cash and we continue to manage our capital for the benefit of long-term shareholders. We invested more than $1.1 billion for share repurchase in 2013 and have another $1 billion authorization remaining.","I am especially proud of our Dollar Tree associates from every department in the company who work hard to deliver on our promise of great value merchandise and stores that are full, fun and friendly for every customer every day. As we enter 2014 our inventories are clean and fresh the shelves are full of terrific merchandise for the spring, St. Patrick\u2019s Day and early Easter shoppers. Our stock rooms are in great shape and our merchandise values have never been higher.","We will now address your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operators Instructions). And we will take our first question from Dan Wewer from Raymond James.","Bob Sasser","Good morning Dan.","Daniel Wewer \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","How are you today?","Bob Sasser","I am doing terrific. I hope you are.","Daniel Wewer \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I am, thank you. Two questions. The comment you made on new store productivity was very helpful can you update us on how new stores are ramping in sales growth, in the following three years after they are opened?","Bob Sasser","Well they always ramp, the first year \u2013 I don\u2019t know I have those numbers in front of me right now but just anecdotally we ramp up the next year \u2013 Kevin do you have?","Kevin Wampler","Yeah, Dan we look at it and we track them by class or Europe, obviously the first three years is when we get the biggest increase in sales but the more interesting thing from my perspective is the fact that if you go back and we track that from the classes 2000 going forward, every class continues to comp positive. So these stores even when they are seven, eight, 10 years old they continue to comp as a class positive.","So it\u2019s kind of counter intuitive and you don\u2019t see that necessarily in all retail concepts but as we would continue to become more productive as an overall company as we\u2019ve continued to broaden assortment in categories and continued to be relevant to the consumer we\u2019ve been able to grow our productivity across all the stores. But you are right, the first three years you will see higher productivity from the comp perspective which is typically two to three times what the rest of the average class is doing.","Daniel Wewer \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, I was just trying to think, given 21% at your selling space three years of age or less is that giving you 2% comp sales gain in your pocket every day you go to work, just for that maturation of the junk stores?","Kevin Wampler","I mean obviously they do provide a bigger part of the overall comp but from our perspective the more important thing is to keep all category of classes going forward on comping positive.","Daniel Wewer \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Then my second question Bob historically during years that minimum wage increase has correlated with very strong same-store sales growth for the value retailers. Now there is discussion about minimum wage up to $10 would you see that impact being on a Dollar Tree comp sales prospects as well as I guess your expense rate would increase with higher payroll?","Bob Sasser","Yeah, it\u2019s sort of hard to predict Dan we don\u2019t know first of all, when the rates will change and of course the proposal out there with the 7.25 going to 9 in 2015 and 10 in 2016 we\u2019d look at that and what the impact might be that most recent federal minimum wage increase was in 2007-08 and \u201809 and we really saw little impact from that we measured at that time.","I would think that a little more money in lower income person\u2019s pocket would find its way into Dollar Tree store where we\u2019re always striving to offer great values that at only $1 price point. The cost impact there would be some cost impact in the first year, depending on when it is, we\u2019re higher than the minimum wage anyways there is 20 states now that have minimum wages greater than 7.25 so it would be after it and after change in the minimum wave the first year would likely see a little or no impact on the cost side and it just depends on where it goes from there but I feel confident we can manage to wage pressures, at wage increases we\u2019ve been able to do so far.","And I think we have a good plan to do that going forward with increasing productivity of our stores, increasing our sales productivity basing whether it\u2019s minimum wage price cost increases or other cost increases that have come along. I think we\u2019ve pretty good history to manage through those.","Daniel Wewer \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah great, thanks.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Bob Sasser","Good morning Matt.","Matthew Boss \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Hey, guys. So on same-store sales look we\u2019ve seen the model generate mid-single digits during good and bad times more recently a low single digit track here. What\u2019s the underlying multi-year run rate we should be thinking about, I mean do you guys believe that anything has changed, is anything flowing, I mean do you think that we could potentially get back to some of the comps we\u2019ve seen in the past?","Bob Sasser","You know Matt our guidance is how we\u2019re thinking about for the next quarter and the next year I will tell you that nothing has changed functionally, structurally, nothing has broken I will point to most recent quarter, it was really hard to see the underlying strength of our business many weeks of the quarter because of all the comparison changes with the shift in the calendar at last year\u2019s 53rd week and now if you go into the superior weathers we had I think 14 name storms.","I don\u2019t even know their names I think they just started naming this year but seven in December and seven in January and that really did disrupt spot of not only our business but I assume everyone else\u2019s too. But structurally we\u2019re always looking to continue to drive the comp store sales increases we have initiatives in place that we think that we will continue to have healthy comp store sales increases, we\u2019ll continue to manage our gross margin as we have for years. And we will continue to manage our expenses for contingent growth in our operating margins.","Matthew Boss \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Great and then on the gross margin line I mean clearly it\u2019s the noise in this quarter but how should we think about that line going forward particularly parsing out the merchandize margins I mean do you see continued opportunity on that line?","Bob Sasser","Matt I will let Kevin talk about parts of the gross profit but I just want to say though that the merchandize margin, merchandize markup we once again delivered maybe a little better than our plan on the merchandize markup we\u2019re in control of that piece of it because we go to market for two purposes, one, to offer the most value for the $1 at a margin we\u2019re willing to accept.","So our initial mark up our merchandize margins are always well controlled through good times, through tough times, through recessionary times, through inflationary times we\u2019ve always been able to manage that. I will let Kevin talk about there are few other components in gross profits for quarter I would let Kevin to describe it for you.","Kevin Wampler","So obviously coming through the fourth quarter good performance on the product margin side from the standpoint of really product again increased gains there were offset a little bit by increased shrink, we\u2019ve seen our shrink increase this year not unlike some other retailers.","So obviously we\u2019re focused on getting that back to where we would like it to be, we were at historically low rates couple of years ago and obviously we have teams that are very focused at the big goal for the teams here to make that happen. As we look at the distribution costs obviously with the opening of Windsor this year that\u2019s created some headwind as far as being able to leverage our distribution costs as well as we have in the past. We\u2019ll obviously cycle that in the Q2 going forward this next year.","So that obviously gives us an opportunity to hopefully see less deleveraging there going forward. Occupancy as always we\u2019ve shown historically probably at a 3% or a little less we can potentially leverage occupancy as we go into the guidance really basically I think just to give you guys some color on that in general is a fact that, we\u2019re really looking for gross profit to be relatively flat year over year improvement in SG&A we obviously believe in continue to drive improvement there and then the other factor affecting us next year is a higher tax rate.","So we\u2019re being affected in 2014 by the fact that the work opportunity tax program has not been renewed at this point in time. That has happened in other points in time over the life cycle of it given we\u2019ve got a pretty integrated process our tax department has created a pretty integrated process with the party where we do a really good job of screening and qualifying people for that. It does become more important to it.","Now historically they have \u2013 they put the program back in the place potentially later in the year and it would potentially be retroactive as historically how we\u2019ve seen it happens. So we may get \u2013 if that would happen we would see the tax rate come down later in the year but that is a little bit of a headwind as well within the P&L as we go through 2014.","Matthew Boss \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Charles Grom \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thanks good morning guys. Just to clarify the guidance for the first quarter low single digit comps is that where you guys are tracking quarter to date?","Bob Sasser","Well our guidance assumes everything that we know, so we have included our quarter to date this year in to our guidance.","Charles Grom \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay. Fair enough. And then in 2013 you guys installed a lot of new initiatives throughout the store the front end and increased SKUs in certain categories that obviously paid off particularly in front half of last year I am just wondering if you guys could shade some light on what you guys have in store for 2014, it looks like the cooler number are going to be a little bit lower, I just want to get if there is other part to the story, that you guys are going to be particularly focused on?","Bob Sasser","There is a lot we\u2019re focused on a broad spot and it\u2019s really staying focused on the customer and the customers\u2019 needs and the things that they want. So we\u2019ll continue to focus initiatives on in stock on basic things they need every day at exceptional value, when they come to shop we want to have those needs based products so that they can complete their shopping trip and when they are in the store, we want seasonal energy, we want them to see the changing of the seasons with the new season, next season, fun things color, exciting things, things they didn\u2019t expect.","We always strive, we point a lot of initiatives at full fun, friendly stores, that are well stocked and customer engagement stores, these are initiatives that continue to \u2013 we work with our store associates to greet our customers, we\u2019re self-service to a large degree but when you see a customer and you\u2019re within smile and greet them and make sure that their needs are being met and all the way through to the front end, as they are going out our cashiers smiling and thanking them for their trip, offering them something else the new item that they may not have seen. So customer engagement initiatives are on our plate.","We want stores that are first of the month ready, a lot of our customers get extra cash in their pocket at the 1st of the month. We want to make sure that our displays are chunky at the 1st of the month, we want fully well stocked stores. We\u2019re going to continue to roll out our frozen and refrigerated it\u2019s high value, it\u2019s a category that does offer reason for a customer to come to our stores more frequently and as I said, we were planning 320 new frozen and refrigerated stores and expanding it in another 50 stores this year, throughout last year was the largest roll out that we had I believe in any one year 608 stores or something like that.","So we began with the plan and we saw the opportunity to expand it and we continue to expand our frozen and refrigerated. Our category expansions of what we call our drive the business initiatives continue with drive the business in stationary and party, candy, max and a lot of our drive the business initiatives in our home department. We\u2019re expanding more really, I believe that with our buying power now and our merchants are finding the ability to leverage that buying power into more value, bigger sizes, bigger saving.","So we\u2019re increasing the value, still a $1 but you get more for the buck than you\u2019ve ever gotten before. And then the last thing I will just point to is, what we call initiatives around operational excellence we would like to offer the same great experience in every store to every customer, every day and we\u2019re doing a lot of work around that, a lot of training, retraining, coaching and applying around our storage bay area, because that is the point of engagement for our customers.","Charles Grom \u2013 Sterne Agee","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks good luck.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Bob Sasser","Hey Paul.","Paul Trussell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey good morning. Thank you for all the color you have given today on the call it\u2019s been very helpful. I just wanted to move to deal stores in Canada. If you could shade a little bit more light on the top line and the margin trends you\u2019re seeing in those smaller segments. So as those pieces of your store will grow a little bigger I just want to know how that will impact the model.","Bob Sasser","I am pleased with where we are, with our deals model we continue to improve, we continue to refine the assortment. In the fourth quarter we had one of our strongest seasons with some of the new categories expanded categories like toys we had expanded, assortments of party and catering in our deal stores that performed very well and our basic home area continues to perform well.","The top line growth in our deal stores and the margin we really don\u2019t break that out from the rest but I am pleased that I think we have opportunity to continue to drive more top line growth in our deal stores, typically we\u2019re aiming those at the more urban environments that maybe underserved that have a lot of customers that need the kind of products that we sale at the value prices.","From that we\u2019re experiencing higher volume sales, higher sales per square foot the margin is lower, the margin rate we have a lot of initiatives around improving the margin rate in our deal stores as we go forward because I think that\u2019s there to be done frankly. But deals are moving along as planned we have a huge opportunity, we have quantified how many stores deals can be, but I can tell you that it\u2019s going to be a large number at the time that we have it right.","Canada it has been really three years now and it\u2019s been three years of investment in Canada we have invested in infrastructure we\u2019ve put all of our \u2013 virtually all of our systems and all the ones would make a difference in Canada as we put all those in. We have invested in people and store teams we have invested in the re-bannering of all of the Dollar giant stores, now are bannered Dollar Tree Canada, that was completed in last year 2013.","We\u2019re investing in the assortment planning process and really the key that Canada now is all about the merchandize and it is all about the stores and it\u2019s about offering the best value for a C$1.25 in the country and we\u2019re capable of doing that we\u2019re seeing some great excitement from the customers when we do that we can do better. We continue to find our way a little bit on some of the consumer products but I am pleased with our ability to get where we need to be in stock in business with our basics every day surrounded by all those great seasonal and unexpected values as you do in Dollar Tree US.","So Dollar Tree Canada, we think we can run overtime up to a 1,000 stores in Canada and we expanded this year dramatically big percentage almost 29% our continued plan is to continue expanding it about 25% rate at store count.","Paul Trussell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s helpful. And then just a question on what you\u2019re seeing from lower income consumers, obviously you have a unique model with the single price point but as you kind of parse through the data, is there any different behavior you are noticing from the customers that do use, EBT within your stores, are they choosing for example the 30 peel private label headache medicine instead of the four pails of that deal, is their basket size changed at all? Any color you could provide on transfer income demographic will be helpful.","Bob Sasser","We take snap and we take food stamp ablate, the food stamp programs have been reduced I think the average customer stamp per recipient like $35 in their monthly food stamp, we haven\u2019t really felt that but if you look at the numbers our percent of stamp transactions is running pretty consistent. It\u2019s the small number anyway as I have always said it but I haven\u2019t seen any impact on the percentage of our stamp benefit. In reality, I do know there is pressure, there has to be pressure when you take your lowest income consumers and take $35 out of your pocket there is an impact from that.","As far as the basket size we really haven\u2019t noticed any changes in that but there continues to be pressure on the consumer, there continues to be burden I think that we all see that in our stores. There are some signs of improvement in the economy but the pressure still remains unemployment is still stubbornly high, still higher cost of living impact, fuel and food and taxes, now living cost with the cold winter.","I think there is obviously going to be more pressure on that and really just the anxiety of the uncertainty of the future all that remains a real strain on the family\u2019s budget, our job at the Dollar Tree is to be part of the solution. We strive to provide products for our customers across the income spectrum that gives them balance of things they need, things they want, tremendous values just at Dollar clean bright stores, friendly people in our stores every customer, every store every day be greeted and treated especially well.","So I can\u2019t tell you that I see any of the numbers in our business I would tell you the pressure still remains. We\u2019re still focused on providing the solutions.","Operator","And we have time for a couple more questions. We\u2019ll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Bob Sasser","Good morning Meredith.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I respect the fact that you guys are always really conservative but other than the tax rate I am kind of scratching my head to understand why you\u2019re really expecting pretty modest increase in net income. Because I mean it\u2019s possible with we have another terrible winter next year but it\u2019s hard to imagine that it\u2019s worse than what we have now.","And it\u2019s really modest growth when you look at the second to fourth quarter, I understand the first quarters being pressured again by weather. But I know you\u2019ve said there is no change in the underlying business but by putting the guidance out so low it says, if you\u2019re saying you do think that there are some kind of underlying issues so I am a little bit confused?","Bob Sasser","Meredith I guess I would start with \u2013 I don\u2019t think the guidance we have given is a whole lot different than traditional in the sense of the increase in earnings per share in that 7% to 15% range that\u2019s been pretty consistent with the last couple of years I believe if you just go back and check.","So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily significantly different. As we seat here today obviously the third and fourth quarter where we had our lowest comps in 2013 that\u2019s the way it\u2019s out there and as we go through the year obviously we\u2019ll have the opportunity to adjust accordingly if there is reason to it. But I do feel that as we put our guidance together and work through it that we\u2019re fairly comfortable with that low single digit comp increase.","We did a 2:4 this year we obviously want to do better and are striving to do better. But there are a lot of different things going on out there, you heard Bob speak to the consumer and the pressures that are continued to be there and all the uncertainty if you take that into consideration obviously what we\u2019re going to focus on is again, doing what we do best which is growing the brand, opening new stores, we\u2019ve got 450 projects on the plans for this year the most we\u2019ve done maybe ever, I guess in a single year.","So we think that\u2019s important if we can continue to think about that and how we can continue to improve our new store productivity there is a lot of things that we working on that hopefully at the end of the day, hopefully we will be able to exceed the guidance but at this point we\u2019re very comfortable with where at with it and I think that\u2019s kind of the background of how we got to it.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And if I could just ask a question about distribution you said that you are going to start work on the 11th distribution center and also expand Joliet this year. I was wondering if you will \u2013 will that continue to have an impact on distribution costs as a percentage of sales or the fact that you have got the new DC opened which is going to shorten the stem miles a little bit do they sort offset each other?","Bob Sasser","Well Meredith first of all we\u2019re expanding our distribution network to provide to support our new store growth as well as our continued comp store growth. So we\u2019ll be expanding Joliet this year we are also looking at DC 11 so we want to share with you, I want to share with you that we\u2019re looking at the DC 11 it will be late in the year and it maybe not much spent actually this year but certainly DC11 is coming up.","We do plan to continue to grow we continue to expand our store base as well as expand productivity of our existing stores. So as we grow, we\u2019ll have to have capacity, so we\u2019re building for our capacity we\u2019re also considering costs, we\u2019re considering stem miles inbound where the vendors are and how much it cost to get into the doors, we\u2019re considering stem miles to our stores as we go forward and as we always have.","So as we open up these new distribution centers, stem miles typically will be reducing so that will provide some positive aspect to our distribution cost, stem mile inbound may or may not reduce that\u2019s the product that where the vendors applied. So all in all, I would expect DC10 to continue to get more efficient to deliver product receipt and deliver our products to our stores more efficiently, as we expand Joliet we are also going to be looking for efficiencies in the expansion to improve how we expand but also how we are delivering the products.","So that\u2019s my expectation for providing for capacity number one, number two, continuing to reap the benefits of decreasing our stem miles.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Bob Sasser","Good morning Matt.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. Two quick follow-ups, first could you talk to the sustainability of the payroll expense improvements that you talked about in the fourth quarter as we look forward to the next few quarters? And then secondly, the cooler and freezer expansion number was quite a bit lower than last year, how much upside do you think there is to that 300-ish number and could you just remind us how many of your existing stores would be eligible for freezer and cooler expansion? Thanks.","Bob Sasser","Matt that freezer and cooler number changes every year because we keep opening new stores every year. We put it in most of the stores that we open as long as there is no restriction in our location as long as the store size that will fit in, sometimes we open smaller store to put that in and also stores of a volume. So there is a three few criteria, we usually meet those restrictions though however, they do take us out of putting them all new stores.","So as we go forward we will have more every year, as we open up new stores we will have more freezer and cooler stores, it won\u2019t be all the new stores typically but it would be some of those. And then we\u2019re always going back and looking at the existing fleet for those same type of criteria because we open up a store and it may be of a volume that we\u2019re not putting the freezer and cooler in, but it grows overtime.","So as it comps up year-over-year then it reaches our volume, then we make profit for those. So it\u2019s hard to say exactly how many it can be because we keep growing I think we\u2019ve characterized it at about 300 a year for a while and for this year it\u2019s 320 there is also opportunity that we\u2019re finding as our business continues to grow to go back and expand some doors in some existing stores that we\u2019re doing 50 of those, that we\u2019ll achieve.","So I think frozen and refrigerated is going to be with us as a growth category for quite some time. We\u2019re growing the store base faster as we\u2019re putting it in.","Kevin Wampler","In regards to your question Matt, in regards to wages and the continued productivity, just like the rest of our business we have initiatives there to help our stores and help them become more efficient if you would look over the last number of years we have had initiatives around store task scheduling to make things consistent across stores and help them understand what needs to be done when and so forth.","We\u2019ve got automated scheduling systems now that helps them as far as making sure we have the right number of people at the right times of the day in the stores. When we\u2019ve done things from a merchandize standpoint, you\u2019ve heard me speak in the past about flow of inventory and how it makes us better when we flow it at a more even level and kind of take out what we referred to as the violent peak such that they can handle in a much better way. So that not only helps the DC but it also helps the flow to the stores and it allows them to get it to the floor much faster at the end of the day in a much more efficient way.","So the interesting thing I think is if you look at maybe the last 10 years we have seen our average hourly wage go up maybe a little less than $2 an hour we\u2019ve actually seen our wages as a percent of sales down about 20 basis points. So we\u2019ve obviously gotten more productivity obviously sales productivity helps that but also just demand initiatives that we consistently work towards to help our overall ability to affect that line item and it\u2019s an important line item because it\u2019s the biggest line item of expense on our P&L at the end of the day.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Good luck for this year.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude the question and answer session, I would now like to turn the call back over to Tim Reid for any additional or closing remarks.","Timothy Reid","Thank you, Devonah.

Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy Reid","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and welcome to the Dollar Tree Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2012.","Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in the business. Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for 2013.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K, all of which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so.","[Operator Instructions]","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, our President and CEO. Bob?","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call, and thank you for your continued interest in Dollar Tree. This morning, we announced our sales and earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012. I'm pleased to report that fourth quarter comparable store sales increased 2.4%. This was on top of a 7.3% increase in the fourth quarter last year. This increase was split somewhat evenly between traffic and average ticket with a 1% gain in traffic and a 1.4% increase in average basket size.","Total sales increased 15.4% to $2.25 billion. Anecdotally, this was the first $2 billion quarter in the history of the company, and it was, as always, achieved largely $1 at a time.","In terms of geography, performance in the fourth quarter was relatively consistent across the country as all zones achieved positive comp store sales. The highest comps came from New England and the Midwest. This was followed closely by the Southwest, the Southeast, Far West and the mid-Atlantic.","Sales growth in the fourth quarter came from a mix of both basic and discretionary products. Our top performing categories include housewares and home products, stationery, health care products, party supplies, food and beverages. Comps were positive every month, with our strongest performance in December.","Earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.01 per share. This represents a 26.3% increase over last year's $0.80 per share. Operating margin for the fourth quarter 2012 was 16.2%, an increase of 70 basis points over the fourth quarter last year. And net income rose by $40.7 million or 21.7% to $228.6 million. These results include the impact of the 53rd week, which contributed approximately $125 million of sales and $0.08 earnings per share.","For the full year fiscal 2012, comp store sales increased 3.4%. That's on top of a 6% comp store sales increase last year and a 6.3% comp in 2010 for a 3-year stack of 15.7%.","Net sales were $7.39 billion, an increase of 11.5% over fiscal 2011. Operating income increased by $138 million and operating margin was 12.4%, an increase of 60 basis points compared with 2011. Net income rose 26.8% to $619.3 million. This was on top of a 22.9% increase in net income last year. Earnings for the full year were $2.68 per share, an increase of 33.3% compared with $2.01 per share last year. In addition to the impact of the 53rd week, the full year results include the previously disclosed gain on the sale of our investment in Ollie's, which contributed $0.16 earnings per share in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of these 2 items, earnings per share for the year rose 21.4% to $2.44 per share.","I'm very pleased with these results. They were achieved in a tough environment. They speak to the value and continued relevance of our merchandise, the power and flexibility of our model and the day-by-day execution of our strategy across the organization. I'm extremely proud of our Dollar Tree associates, who work every day to deliver on our promise of great value merchandise and a clean, bright and fun place for our customers to shop.","Looking forward, we're excited about our growth potential and continued relevance to the customer. Over the next several years, we expect the consumers' demand for value will continue to grow and intensify. Dollar Tree is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the continuing trend. Our plan is to grow our business by providing more value to a broader range of customers, and we're doing this in many ways.","The first way is through organic new store growth, and we have a lot of room to grow. For the full year 2012, we opened 345 new stores and relocated or expanded 87 stores for a total of 432 projects. Selling square footage increased 7.7%. We exceeded our original plan, which included 315 new stores and a total of 390 projects and we ended the year with 4,671 stores. In the fourth quarter this year, boosted by January openings, we opened 47 stores and relocated and expanded 6 stores.","And the past we've chosen not to open stores in January, but that's changing. In fiscal 2012, due to the efficiency of our store development teams, we accelerated the opening of 25 new stores and 5 relocations from early fiscal 2013 into January, and we like the results. In addition to generating incremental sales in fiscal 2012, these stores will now give us a full year of sales in 2013 and improved productivity.","Excluding the 30 projects opened ahead of schedule in January, square footage growth in fiscal 2012 would have been 7.1%.","This year our plan includes approximately 340 new stores and 75 relocations for a total of 415 projects across the U.S. and Canada. This is in addition to the 25 new store openings and 5 relocations that we completed early and opened in January 2013. Square footage growth is planned to be 7.3% over fiscal 2012, which included the 30-store projects in January.","In addition to opening more stores, our plan is to open better stores. I am particularly pleased that average new store sales per square foot increased once again in 2012 to the highest level since 2001. New store productivity has now increased each year for 7 consecutive years.","This improvement has been a team effort. Our real estate department is focused on improved site selection and on rightsizing our stores to the market. Our merchants are working to develop more productive floor plans and expanding assortments with a focus on the most productive categories of merchandise. And our field organization is opening stores faster and more efficiently through improved staffing and building the bench of qualified store management. These have been the key elements to increasing our new store productivity, and we expect this to continue.","Efforts to increase sales per square foot are not limited to new stores. Elements of the strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout the chain. In all stores, we're developing more powerful seasonal presentations to create interest and a fun shopping experience. Across the chain, we're expanding our basic assortments in candy, stationery, health and beauty care and home and household products to maintain relevance to our customers. These were among our fastest growing categories in the fourth quarter.","We have re-fixtured, re-merchandised and expanded assortments at the front end of our stores to create more merchandise energy and to drive impulse sales. Store associates are emphasizing the friendly factor with more effective customer engagement and working to drive sales of related items through cross-merchandising and through suggestive selling.","And our expansion of frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 329 stores in 2012, including 190 new stores, exceeding our goal of 325 installations. We now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,549 stores. This important category is extremely productive. It serves the current needs of our customers, drives traffic into our stores and provides incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. We plan to expand frozen and refrigerated product to an additional 475 stores this year.","Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats, expansion of our geographic reach and the development of additional channels of distribution, specifically that means Deal$, Dollar Tree Canada and Dollar Tree Direct.","Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ stores deliver low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deal$, we're able to serve more customers with more products at value prices every day.","Awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing and the concept is building momentum. In the fourth quarter, Deal$ had particular success in toys, softlines, stationery and HBC. I'm excited about the growth potential of Deal$, and particularly the opportunity that it provides to grow profitably in the higher cost of operation urban markets. We had a 25 new Deal$ stores in 2012 and ended the year with a net total of 194 Deal$ stores. We plan to continue this growth rate in 2013.","Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. Through the investments made during 2011 in systems, training and infrastructure, we now have consistent year-on-year data on which to base our sales and assortment planning. Specifically, we have visibility to our own hand [ph], own order and sales along with a trailing history by store and SKU. These are all key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain and improving customer satisfaction.","With our merchant teams leveraging the buying power of the Dollar Tree, Canadian customers are beginning to find broader, more exciting assortments and better values in our stores. Our recent Valentine's Day assortment reflected the best items from Dollar Tree, and our customers responded enthusiastically.","Our focus continues on building and solidifying store teams and improving product flow to the stores. We're working very hard to increase the service level and in-stock position of basic products, while improving the shopping experience through a more powerful, seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. And we're aggressively expanding our Canadian store base. We began 2012 with a plan to grow store count approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. We exceeded this plan, opening 41 new stores and we ended the year with 140 stores in Canada.","Additionally, in 2012, we completed the re-branding of all the former Dollar Giant stores in Ontario to Dollar Tree Canada. And we'll complete the transition with the re-branding of the stores in the Western provinces by the end of the third quarter this year.","Merchandise in Dollar Tree Canada will reflect the combination of the Dollar Tree U.S. assortment, expanded with unique, high-value offerings sourced by our Canadian merchandising team. We see enormous potential in Canada, and we expect to grow our store count by 25% or greater in 2013.","As previously reported, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. Our goal is to be the leading retailer in Canada at a single price point of $1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price.","Adding to our growth strategy, Dollar Tree Direct, our e-commerce business, is expanding as planned. This additional channel of distribution provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores. Some key milestones achieved by -- in 2012 by Dollar Tree Direct include growth in site traffic, which exceeded 5 million unique customers in the fourth quarter, a 20% increase over the fourth quarter last year. Dollar Tree Direct now has over 2,600 items available online, including 850 unique items that can be purchased in less than case quantities, an increase of over 65% versus the same time last year.","We're using social media to drive brand awareness. Our 2012 holiday YouTube video was popular once again. The video had a 15% increase in views over last year's holiday video. Additionally, over 2 million people chose to interact with Dollar Tree via their mobile devices during the fourth quarter. Through these initiatives and more, Dollar Tree Direct is gaining customers every quarter. We expect to see continued growth in our Dollar Tree direct sales.","One of the keys to achieving consistent, profitable results has been our practice of adding infrastructure and distribution capacity to support growth ahead of the need. In that regard, construction is proceeding according to schedule on our new 1 million square foot distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. DC10 will be automated and it's designed to increase capacity and provide cost-effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the Northeast.","In addition to our new Northeast DC, in January we announced plans to expand our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma by 400,000 square feet, bringing its total size to 1 million square feet. Both the Marietta expansion and the new Windsor DC are being financed through available cash, and both will be operational in the third quarter this year.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance. Kevin?","Kevin S. Wampler","Thanks, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 26.3% in the fourth quarter to $1.01. The increase resulted from our sales growth, a 15 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 55 basis point reduction in total SG&A expense compared to the fourth quarter last year. Sales and earnings for the quarter were also favorably impacted by the addition of the extra 14th week, consistent with the 53-week retail calendar, which contributed $125 million of sales and $0.08 to earnings per share.","Our gross profit margin grew to 37.9% during the fourth quarter compared to 37.8% in the fourth quarter last year. We achieved strong leverage in occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the impact of the 53rd week and the increase in comparable store sales. We also achieved reductions in both shrink and markdown expense as a percent of sales. The shrink improvement came primarily from our Canadian operation, reflecting the full implementation of our SKU-based inventory system for both periods.","The improvements were partially offset by increased freight cost, due to our higher trucking rates and the impacts of the continuing shifts in product mix, as basic consumable products increased by about 60 basis point as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter.","SG&A expenses were 21.7% of sales for the quarter, compared with 22.2% reported in the fourth quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses declined by approximately 25 basis points, due to lower incentive compensation expense compared with last year, partially offset by an increase in store payroll as a percent to sales.","Depreciation declined by 15 basis points, helped in large part by the extra week. And operating expenses declined by approximately 10 basis points, due to reduction in insurance and utility expense as a percent of sales.","Operating income increased $61.5 million compared with the fourth quarter last year and operating margin was 16.2%, an increase of 70 basis points for the fourth quarter last year. It was the highest quarterly operating margin since 2002. For the full year, operating income increased $138 million and our operating margin grew to 12.4%, up 60 basis points from last year's 11.8% operating margin.","The tax rate for the quarter was 37% versus 37.7% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower rate reflects primarily the favorable impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and a slightly lower state tax rate. For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 36.7% compared with 37.4% in 2011.","Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. Cash and cash equivalents at year end totaled $399.9 million versus $288.3 million at the end of fiscal 2011. During the fourth quarter, we invested $104.9 million for the repurchase of 2.7 million shares. For the full year, we invested $340.2 million for the share repurchase -- for share repurchase and repurchased 7.7 million shares. At year end, we had $860 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter was $227.1 million. We will update you on additional share repurchases, if any, at the end of the quarter in which they may occur.","We continue to focus on increasing our inventory turns. Our inventory turns increased in 2012 for the eighth consecutive year to 4.25. Consolidated inventory at year end was 12% greater than at the same time last year and selling square footage grew by 7.7%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 4.1%, which is down from the 5.2% increase at the end of the third quarter. This overall increase reflects inventory in our distribution centers relating to the earlier Easter, our Spring Fling promotion and the first quarter store openings. In addition, store level inventory was slightly higher, reflecting the timing of year end relative to Valentine's Day due to the 53rd week.","Capital expenditures were $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. This compares with $53.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year of 2012, capital expenditures were $312.2 million compared with $250.1 million in 2011.","For 2013, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores or remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 475 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $37 million towards the new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut and $25 million for the expansion of our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $46.9 million for the fourth quarter versus $44 million for the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, depreciation was $175.3 million, a 10 basis point decrease from last year. For 2013, depreciation and amortization is estimated to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million.","Our guidance for 2013 includes the following assumptions: First, in regard to freight expense, we will soon be negotiating new ocean rates that become effective in May 1. As always, we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations nor can anyone accurately predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that ocean freight rates and diesel prices will be similar to their current levels on average throughout fiscal 2013.","Second, Easter is 1 week earlier this year and it moves into March. This represents about a $4 million sales challenge in the first quarter. Also as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, this year, there are 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which represents a $25 million sales challenge for the fourth quarter.","Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.1% for the first quarter and 37.8% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 226.2 million shares for the first quarter and 226.7 million shares for the full year. While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.","With that in mind, for the first quarter of 2013, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.84 billion to $1.89 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.53 to $0.58, which would represent a 6% to 16% increase compared to the first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.50 per diluted share.","Sales range implies a low single digit comparable store sale increase and 6.8% square footage growth.","For the full fiscal year of 2013, we are forecasting sales in the range of $7.79 billion to $7.97 billion based on a low single-digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.3% square footage growth.","Diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.54 to $2.74. This represents an increase of 4% to 12% over 2012 earnings per share of $2.44, which excludes the impact of the 53rd week and the gain from the sale of Ollie's in the third quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Kevin. Once again, I'm very pleased with our company's performance in the fourth quarter and for the year of 2012. In summary, our comp store sales increased 3.4% and total sales grew 11.5% to a record $7.4 billion. Operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 12.4%. That's the best in the past 12 years, and earnings per share increased by 21.4%, excluding the positive impact of the 53rd week and the gain from the sale of Ollie's.","We opened 345 new stores in 2012. We expanded and relocated 87 stores and we ended the year with 4,671 stores and square footage growth of 7.7%.","Last year, our new stores achieved the highest sales per square foot in 12 years since 2001 when our average store size was much smaller. We expanded frozen and refrigerated product to 329 stores for a total of 2,549 stores across the U.S.","At Deal$, new customers are pleased to find surprising values on consumer basics, and you can see it in the results. Comp sales at Deal$ benefited from both increased traffic and increased average ticket. Customers are shopping more frequently and buying more on each trip.","We opened 41 new stores in Canada, representing a 40% increase in our Canadian store base, and we're beginning to translate our investments in systems and to better merchandise assortments for our Canadian customers.","Significant enhancements to Dollar Tree Direct, such as expanding bright pack, enhancing our mobile capability and increasing our social media presence are attracting more customers. In order to efficiently support our continued growth, we broke ground on a new 1 million square foot DC in Windsor, Connecticut, and we've announced plans for the expansion of our Marietta, Oklahoma DC.","As always, we continue to manage capital for the benefit of long-term shareholders. Last year, we repurchased $340.2 million of our stock. We sold our interest in Ollie's in the third quarter with a gain of $60 million and a contribution of $38 million to net income, and we executed a 2-for-1 stock split in June.","2012 was another great year of great accomplishment, and I will tell you that we're singularly positioned to do even better in the future. We have a vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen. We're opening new Dollar Tree stores, and there's plenty of room to grow. We're growing the productivity of our stores in both new stores and in comp stores. We're growing through new formats, like Deal$ and Dollar Tree Direct, and we're growing through expanded geography. Canada provides a great opportunity for substantial growth.","We will now address your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about what changed from the third quarter when same-store sales were struggling to be slightly positive to a 2.4% gain in the fourth quarter? In particular the comparison actually became more difficult during the fourth quarter. And also curious as to why you're not expecting same-store sales to accelerate in the second half of 2013 given the comparisons become quite a bit easier.","Bob Sasser","Well, Dan, in reflecting back over the last year, the third quarter, we were up against a big comp in third quarter, too, as I remember. We were especially up against that big comp in our consumer products. It was probably the highest, you didn't know that, but the highest consumer products comps that we were up against for the year. So there's a little difference and when you're looking at third quarter versus fourth quarter about what we're selling and the mix of what we're selling. Of course, in fourth quarter, we had a couple -- we had the holidays. And at Dollar Tree, we're always -- we come in to our own at the holidays. And I think that's what you saw. We were up against in fourth quarter the largest comp of the year and the largest quarter of the year, and it came out with a 2.4% comp. And I think it was just really great execution. We invested into stores, standards and quality, and we've got great execution. We had great merchandise in the fourth quarter, great values. And by that, we overcame the 7-plus percent comp from the year before. As to your second question, I believe about this year in the second half, we're really excited about the second half of this year. We're giving guidance to you based on what we know and from internal and what we see from external. We can -- we've given first quarter guidance and then guidance for the year. In uncertain times, our guidance -- our visibility of first quarter is a lot better than it is of fourth quarter. So we're factoring in some of the uncertainty in the business that we're looking forward. I do expect the second half of the year to be particularly strong. So that's how we got to the guidance, though. We know what we know, less visibility the further you get out.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Let's just -- if you're right, let's say that the same-store sales are in fact low single digit for all of fiscal year '13, historically, if you look at the inflation pressure at the store level, it runs about 2% to 3% a year. Do you see any opportunities to ratchet down the rate of expense growth so that you have a chance to get expense leverage with only 1.5% or a 2% comp?","Bob Sasser","Dan, we've proven we can get leverage on 1.5% or 2% comp. Third quarter, we've got leverage on our expenses. This year, 1.6% comp. Fourth quarter, 2.4% comp. We've got leverage on expenses. So yes, there's continued opportunity to leverage our expenses on those low single-digit comps as we go forward. And we intend to, by the way.","Operator","We will go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you talk to any impact that you've seen from the payroll tax or the delayed tax refunds and if trends in January and February are any different than what you saw during the full quarter?","Bob Sasser","Look, the consumer is under pressure. Burdened and concerned is the way we sort of characterize the consumer right now. They're facing not only higher payroll taxes but rising gas prices. And with the tax refunds being delayed, they really are under pressure. Overall, less money to spend and you add to that job concerns and uncertainty that everybody sees out there right now. But at Dollar Tree, we think of ourselves as part of the solution. We're seeing the effect on the consumer. But we think we're part of the solution and a destination for a cash-strapped customer that's trying to balance their budget. We have all the things that you need. Over half of what we sell now, 50.1%, are products that are needed most often and must-haves in everyday life, high value and they're only $1. And we're -- when our customers are in the store, they can still splurge at Dollar Tree. On the discretionary products, yes, you can afford it at Dollar Tree. It maybe discretionary, but it's only $1 also. So we believe as we've said for years, we are right for all time. We believe we're more relevant today with the consumer under pressure than we've ever been. And we think that's going to continue for a few years, several years.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, can you talk to the cadence of the cooler, freezer expansion this year? And then are there any other significant SKU additions or deletions planned for this year?","Bob Sasser","No. The cadence is going to be throughout the first half, especially and then -- and maybe into third quarter. The -- we take a little break around Easter. We don't want to do anything to disrupt our customer shopping experience around that important time of the year. But we're rolling out the 475 pretty regularly throughout the year, especially in the first half. What was the second question?","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Any SKU significant category expansions or SKU additions this year?","Bob Sasser","Yes. We're looking at across the business. We're looking at where we think we have opportunities to increase our market share, to drive sales, to drive margins. You're going to see expansions in our stores through the course of the year in our household products area, in our Candy, snacks and beverage area. In our stationery business. We're very excited about our stationery business. And also in our party business. So as we look at our -- in addition to 475 more stores with frozen and refrigerated product, we're expanding a lot of variety categories in the business. We're also -- we have and continue to reengineer the front ends, 40% more SKUs on the front ends, permanent homes for our drive items, more and better customer engagement at the front of the store. We really want our customers to be challenged by great value and to purchase great product from the time they enter the store until the time they leave the store. So you check out, assortments are there, more SKUs, better variety, a lot the value, ever-changing mix on the front end of the stores, the front tables, the items of the week and especially in the seasonal department.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Aram Rubinson with Nomura.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you tell us about your customer a little bit? Specifically I'm curious how they index to tobacco and to alcohol. I guess, what I'm trying to drive at is whether or not that push by Family Dollar and Dollar General to those categories even though they're different formats may have any impact on your own business or customer.","Bob Sasser","Well, I guess, our customer probably indexes the same as their customer does to tobacco. We have no plans to add tobacco in Dollar Tree stores. It's bad for you, but it's also bad for our margins at Dollar Tree. So there are no plans for tobacco. We are going to continue driving sales through, again as I said, to the earlier question, we're really excited about the frozen, refrigerated business rolling out another 475 stores and expanding a lot of our variety categories, as well as expanding our wow items through the year. In times where consumers are in need of value, we've always been able to step it up and offer even more value for the dollar. We're looking to do that throughout the year this year with what we call our wow items, bigger sizes, bigger savings, still just $1. And by the way, operational excellence, we put great value on running great stores and a shopping experience that our customers find pleasurable.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And if you don't mind a follow-up about inventory management. Your inventory management has been fantastic for many years. So my question is a little counterintuitive. But I'm wondering whether or not you might be able to sell more if you stock more inventory, again I know it's counterintuitive. But can you and have you tested whether plugging inventory can drive enough incremental sales from here to justify the investment?","Bob Sasser","Yes. Just speaking anecdotally to that and not to figures, but the -- more inventory doesn't always equate into more sales. And what we want to have is a right amount of inventory in our stores for our customers when they want to buy it. So our opportunity continues to be the supply chain and delivering the right amount of inventory at the right times. We can still increase our turnover. We can still lower our average inventory levels and still satisfy our customers even better, with less inventory in some cases. So I do appreciate the counterintuitive question. It's the one that our merchants ask me all the time. But at the end of the day, the proof is in the pudding, and high inventories do not equal high sales. It's all about the right merchandise in the stores and then the productivity of that.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Boss of JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","From a competition standpoint, have you seen any impact on your traffic from a competitive standpoint, any recent actions worth noting from your peers? And are you feeling any incremental pressure on any categories from a pricing perspective as a result of anything you've seen out there recently?","Bob Sasser","We're looking at competition all the time. We watch them closely. I have great admiration for what they do. But you've heard me say this before, we're just different. And we're small and we're convenient and we're well located, where middle America either lives or shops or both. At Dollar Tree, everything is $1. So the idea of staying focused on what we do the best is what we're about. The -- in a Dollar Tree store, 10,000 square feet, everything is $1. It's an honest proposition. It is disarming to the customer, and that's our goal is to continue to exceed their expectations for what they can buy at a Dollar Tree. We do watch the competition. I do watch what they do. We respond really more to the customer than we do what the competition is doing, and that has worked well for us.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on more home discretionary. Have you seen -- can you talk about any trends in the quarter on the non-consumable side? Any bright spots in home or seasonal? And any in-store initiatives to drive the basket going forward? And then finally, tax refunds are beginning to trickle back in. Have you seen any improvement over the last couple weeks?","Bob Sasser","I would tell you, in the last couple of weeks, the first -- and we're in the year, what, 3 weeks now. And it's a story -- 2 stories on this year. 3 weeks at end of the year, I'll share with you what I think the story so far is and what the changes could be. But first of all, we had a terrific Valentine's Day. We don't break all that stuff out. It's too early to report. But I do want to tell you that Valentine's Day occurred and it's probably the best sell-through we've had in years and years. I was extremely pleased with our Valentine's business. On the flip side of that coin, we've had the worst weather. We've had through the center of the country and then up the East Coast, seems like there's a storm a week. And so that had been sort of a drag on our business. Overall, it's 3 weeks in, and we're -- everything -- we're still -- we just gave you our guidance. So all of that is baked into that. But that has been more of what we've seen. It's really hard to see when those storms are sweeping through and dumping all that snow and closing stores, and people are losing electricity and can't drive. It's really difficult to see what the core power of the business is in these past 3 weeks with all the disruptions from storms and then of course the Valentine's holiday that we had. My feel is, though, that as the refund checks get out that people will be out shopping. Those people that get them will be spending them as they have in the past. That's a good thing. My feeling is that as the economic environment, throughout the year, becomes more transparent, and it will, and there'll be more visibility. And I feel that things are going to improve over what they are now for the consumer that we'll see the impact of that. We prefer more people working. We prefer more certainty, less uncertainty. And I'm hopeful that we can see that. And in the meantime, we are absolutely zeroed in on the customer that is under pressure from high gas prices, from the tax refunds being later and from the higher taxes. So if you're under pressure, by gosh, we want to have it. When you come to our store, we want to have the things you need. We want to have them in stock. We want to exceed your expectations with more value on the things that you need. And we want you to have a fun shopping experience, so that's where we are.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to change gears a little bit, maybe if you can talk to just your thoughts on the buyback and maybe the willingness or ability to take on leverage at all to even increase the buyback going forward.","Kevin S. Wampler","Sure. I mean, obviously, as we look at our capital allocation every year and we put a lot of thought into it. And obviously, our first priority is to fund the business and its growth. And as we've always said, the best use of any dollar is to build another Dollar Tree store, which we're doing plenty of that. And as Bob said, we have a lot of room for growth out there, so that's going to continue. And as -- we spent more the last year or 2 on infrastructure from the standpoint of expanding our distribution network as well. So new [ph] 10 up in Windsor, Connecticut, the total price on that is about $97 million on an overall basis and another $25 million for Marietta. So obviously, we are continuing to fund the business through that manner. From a share repurchase standpoint, obviously, it has been an important part of what we've done and we do believe it's very important as a way to return to our shareholders. And $340 million this past year, $645 million in 2011 and $414 million in 2010. So it obviously has been a big piece of it, and we still have $860 million outstanding in our authorization. That's one piece. Obviously, as we always look at acquisition. If there's something out there that makes sense, we're open to that. We haven't done anything since Canada, which we purchased in the fall of 2010. But obviously, we always keep that consideration out there. And the board and the company looks -- talks about dividends from time to time. We do believe we're in a point where we want to do that. So as we look at share repurchase, we're looking at it as a great way of returning value to our shareholders. I would tell you on an overall basis that one of the other things I look at is our overall return on invested capital. And if you look since 2008, our return on invested capital is 16% and we've since grown it so that the last 2 years, it's approximated 30%. And we feel very, very good about that. And I think if you would benchmark that against others within our sector that you see it benchmarks very favorably, at the end of the day. So we kind of look at it from an overall perspective on a return on invested capital as well. The question is would we leverage up to buy additional shares. Historically, within the last few years, we've not done that. We've intended to spend our free cash flow. Doesn't mean that if the opportunity presented itself that we wouldn't. We obviously have a line of credit in place. We have a lot of availability on it. So it wouldn't be hard to do. It's just not been in our nature at this point in time. As we've said, we've bought back over $1 billion in the last 3 years, and that's without basically borrowing $0.10 to do it. So we feel good about it from that perspective.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Then one quick follow-up, if I may. This one maybe for Bob. You had referenced that you're still below your prior peak sales per square foot. I'm wondering is that a target that you think that you can reach longer term even with a bigger store. Is that kind of the appropriate way to think about it?","Bob Sasser","Yes. We think about it as year-over-year growth, incrementally improving our productivity of our stores, our new stores, our existing stores. Those small stores years ago were 5,000 square feet and they pretty much peaked out in year 1 and the comps then became stubborn, if you remember that. The new larger stores, when we started opening them, sales per square foot went down, but it gave us a longer runway by which we could serve more customers for a longer period of time without reinvesting in the store and expanding the store. So we've been building it back over the years. We continue to build it. And yes, there's still plenty of opportunity to drive sales per square foot in all of our stores.","Operator","We'll go next to John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A question, if we look back over the course of the year and Bob, I noticed your tone today is considerably more upbeat than at the Analyst Day when there were some difficult months in there. What gives you the confidence given the volatility we saw last year that in 2013 we won't see similar volatility in comp trend? How do you feel about the business, the consumer? Maybe with more distance looking back, what happened in the October quarter? And how do we, as investors, feel good that the trends can be more consistent as we go forward?","Bob Sasser","Yes. John, just backing up and looking at the past year, it was a terrific year. Even at our Investor Conference, I was upbeat about the business, the longer-term view of the business. And if you look back at third quarter, I think we had record operating margin and higher inventory turns. And we didn't like the comp, 1.6% comp. We always want more. But the P&L was just really spectacular, frankly. So we have every reason to be proud of third quarter. We came at -- it was a big quarter to be up against. We came in the fourth quarter, another big quarter. At the Investors Conference, if you remember last year, I was saying, \"We're giving you the information on how we looked at third quarter. And oh, by the way, fourth quarter was going to be a big hurdle for us.\" And I didn't look at that as not being upbeat, I looked at it as just being transparent and reminding you of what we were facing and how we were going to go about it. So that's what we did. And at the end of the day, I'm really proud of third quarter. I'm really proud of fourth quarter and the year. I always want more comps. I always want higher operating margin. I especially want high returns. So those are the things that we're focused on. I think maybe what gives me confidence going forward -- it is tough calendar. We know that and we planned for it. Easter is early. Easter is not good for the top line growth typically, but we planned for that. It's a tough fourth quarter. It's 6 less days -- selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We planned for that. We have exciting plans for third quarter of next year. Third quarter next year -- this year is 1.6% comp we're up against. So it's sort of the reverse of last year. So I see that as great opportunity as we go, and we're making plans to make third quarter very good. But I have just great confidence in the model, our flexibility. We've been doing this at a $1 for 27 years. We feel pretty confident that we're good in all times. We've seen up times then down times, and we've performed well. We've been able to offer more value to our customer over the 27 years, haven't raised our price. Our product is better than ever. Our value is better than ever. Our operating margin continues to rise, may be counterintuitive. So 2013, we have great merchandise. We have great product. We have great plans in this tough year. And by the way, the consumer in their search for balancing their budgets, they're making less and spending more on everything else. At Dollar Tree, you can buy everything for $1, you can help balance your budget. By the way, have a good time. Buy a toy for your child, have a party at the school and everything is still $1. We're excited about our business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bob, can you talk about what you guys are seeing on merchandise margins? And then the second question is going to be what are your expectations for the Canadian operation from a profitability standpoint for '13?","Bob Sasser","Well, let me start with the second one first. The -- Canada, we're really excited about. We're still in investment mode. The -- it was about a $0.02 to $0.03 pressure on this year's earnings. For next year, we have plans. We think that we're going to improve over that. But we still have some investments to be made. And I think for Canada, the opportunity we're seeing growth in the top line next year. We're excited about that. We're getting our stores re-branded. And with the re-branding, remix, re-merchandise and bringing to bear all of the information [ph] that we put in. Only a year ago now, we're just starting to see the numbers from that. So I think there's going to be a payback from that. So there could be still some pressure in 2013 on the bottom line for Canada. But less than this year. And this year was only $0.02 to $0.03. We're investing in our future in Canada. As I said, we think we can open around 1,000 stores there. And in order to do that, we want to get it right in the beginning, and that's what we're doing. The margin, overall, there's -- I've said this before and I'll say it again, we're in control of our margin. We don't planogram items. There's nothing that we have to have. Our buyers, our merchants are encouraged to offer the highest value for $1 price point at a margin that we are willing to accept. And the one we're willing to accept is the one we planned. So we're just about always going to hit our margin on items and on departments and on categories and subcategories. If you look at any of the -- most of the margin, gross margin changes which we've been -- we've managed it through a pretty tight band over the years. But it's usually all about mix. And when the mix is more consumer products, a little pressure on the margin. And when the mix is more variety of product, and I guess better times and you're selling more -- a little more variety merchandise. Throughout the years though, it's been managed within a very tight band, and I know that we can continue to do that. We don't see, I don't see, there's always something that's going up. There's always something that's going down. But with our philosophy of not having to have anything, we're going to be able to manage through this year once more. You heard Kevin say our guidance includes pretty much the same kind of ocean freight rates, as we experienced. So we're not expecting pressure there. It'd be nice to get a little improvement, but we're not expecting it. The merchandise margins are good, improving, flat to last year, maybe even up in some cases. We just had the trip -- the January trip, which is one of the big trips of the year to Asia. I can tell you, it was well planned. Our merchants were knowledgeable and enthusiastic. It was the best trip that I've been on with our group of merchants, using historical data that -- armed with a financial plan for every category and a strategy to back that up. They'd already shopped the market here. They knew what the winners were out across the country and what the losers were. And we went off and went to Asia with a real plan, worked with the vendors, got the best prices. And I got to tell you, with the merchandise that's coming from that trip, first of all, for our fourth quarter next year, our mark on is going to be on plan from the import side. We've already done that. The merchandise is going to be really exciting. We have new home and textile products, their own trend, our housewares categories are exceptional, especially our dinnerware is just striking, really. We're able to do what our merchants are able to do for the $1 price point. They've updated our stationery assortment. They've updated our party assortment. Our toy department was completely overhauled. It's just really was an exciting trip. And frankly, it is the best trip I've been on since I've been with Dollar Tree. So I'm encouraged on the margin side. I'm encouraged on the value side for fourth quarter.","Operator","And our final question will come from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I was hoping you could just give us the stats around your credit and debit card penetration and perhaps provide some commentary just on how the MasterCard acceptance to 75% of the stores has been received initially in the fourth quarter.","Kevin S. Wampler","Sure, Peter, I'd be glad to do that. So in general, between debit and credit, it's basically -- for the year, it was roughly about 38%, 39% of sales. So it continues to increase a little bit. We've seen basically -- in the fourth quarter, we did see strong growth in the credit card business. It was up about 180 basis points. So -- and again, that we rolled -- as you said, we rolled MasterCard out to additional 3,500 stores, roughly, leading into the fourth quarter. So it was obviously well received. Anecdotally, we heard from a lot of stores where customers were very happy to see that we're now accepting it chain-wide. So we do feel that it has been successful. And so overall, the expectation is as the industry continues to grow, we expect our shift to debit and credit to continue, although it's obviously not near what it was a few years ago when we had initially put it in place.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. That's all very good to hear. And I guess just to follow up on that, the 180 basis points shift in credit would be pretty sizable from what you guys have had during recent years, and MasterCard is a pretty widely held card. So is that -- as sort of awareness is building, are you seeing that credit shift actually accelerate as the months go by? And then kind of coupled with that, your ticket growth was one of the best you've had in, I guess, about a year. Is the ticket growth being impacted by that MasterCard acceptance as well?","Kevin S. Wampler","I would say in general, the 180 basis point increase, as we look at it, I really believe is, as we've analyzed it, it's where it came from. Part of that conversion is people -- half of that conversion is people are paying cash previously that are now paying with a credit card and the other half is somebody who changed from a card they were using maybe to MasterCard. So you might have seen some people leave debit and go to credit, in some instances even. So I think in general from a ticket perspective, it's obviously beneficial to have our average ticket for a credit\/debit transaction is significantly higher than a cash transaction. So it's not a bad thing to get that conversion. I think it's a small piece of the pie as far as the growth in ticket. I actually believe that a bigger piece of it always relates back to the merchandise in the stores and the store operators setting up great displays. And we've done work around our front ends, impulse items and things like that, which I think are important as we continue to go forward and is a big initiative for us on an overall basis. So I think that's probably more important to the overall ticket.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Reid for any additional or closing comments.","Timothy Reid","Thank you, Mike, and thanks to all of you for your participation in the call today, particularly for your interest and most importantly for your investment in Dollar Tree.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Randy Guiler, Vice President Investor Relations.

Participating on today's call will be our CEO, Bob Sasser; our CFO, Kevin Wampler, and our Enterprise President, Gary Philbin.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors.

Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now I will turn the call over to Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Randy and good morning, everyone. As you know this morning, we announced our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016. Enterprise total sales for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $5.64 billion and same-store sales, which now includes our Family Dollar Segment, on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%.","Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 1.3%. By segment, same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.3% or 2.4% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations. And for the Family Dollar banner same-store sales increased 0.2%.","Our gross margin rate improved 130 basis points to 32.1%. We leveraged our total SG&A expense by 30 basis points. Operating income increased 24.9% to $586.5 billion and our year-over-year operating margin for the quarter improved from 8.8% to 10.4%.","Net income for the quarter increased 40.5% to $321.8 million and our earnings per share were $1.36. This represents a 40.2% improvement from the fourth quarter a year ago and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.03 per share.","This was a very solid quarter across both banners. Total sales were near the mid-point of our range of guidance. Same-store sales were positive in both Dollar Tree and in Family Dollar. Gross margin rate and the operating margin rates improved and SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed.","Operating margin improved 160 basis points to 10.4% for the quarter and importantly our EPS exceeded the top-end of our range of guidance. We\u2019re pleased with our progress on the integration of our Family Dollar business and we remain on track to deliver at least $300 million in run rate synergies by the end of the third year post acquisition.","There\u2019s still much more to be done and we continue to believe we will ultimately surpass our three year target. Our strategy remains unchanged, to deliver great values and convenience to our shoppers every day. With the combination of our complimentary brands, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we have on parallel of opportunity and value retail to serve more customers in our markets.","We believe we are in the most attractive sector in retail. Shoppers today are increasingly focused on value and convenience and that\u2019s exactly what Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provide, value and convenience.","Looking forward, our banners are positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustain growth and improve profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improve our business. We\u2019re opening more stores. In fiscal 2016, we opened 584 new stores. And in fiscal 2017, our plans include opening 650 new stores.","Additionally, we\u2019re keenly focused on increasing the productivity of all of our stores. We see continued opportunity to increase sales, improve gross margin and better manage the cost structure within each of our banners through our continued focus on the customer, drive the business initiatives, timely category reviews, new items, category expansions, shared services and just running great stores, open exciting stores.","Dollar Tree Canada continues to be a key brand in our portfolio and an important component of our growth strategy. I\u2019m extremely proud and pleased with the progress made by our merchant and store teams in Canada. Their continued efforts to serve the Canadian customer are delivering higher store productivity each year.","Comp sales momentum continued into fourth quarter, driven by increases in both average ticket and customer count. Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants continue to source higher value product and our customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in Dollar Tree Canada stores.","Our goal is to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of CAN1.25, just as we\u2019re in the U.S. at the $1 price point. We now operate 226 stores in Canada and believe we have an opportunity for 1000 stores over time.","In addition to Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree Canada, our online business at Dollar Tree Direct is growing in size, performance and importance. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores.","While Dollar Tree Direct is a relatively small component when compared to our overall business, I continue to be very pleased with its year-over-year growth. As retailers in the digital age, we plan to engage with our customers wherever and however they prefer. We strive to run world class stores, deploy world class digital mediums and engage with our customers via conventional and digital marketing channels such as email, Facebook, Pinterest, [indiscernible], Twitter and much more.","Where the customers prefer to contact Dollar Tree Direct via their phones, their pads, their laptops or their desktops, we\u2019re ready and able to connect with them. We continue to very pleased with the growth of both sales and visitors to our Dollar Tree Direct business. Please check this out at dollartree.com.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gary to provide more detail on our performance and our priorities.","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. As Bob commented, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, but we know we're still capable of doing better. We operate in an environment of continuous improvement and drive the key business initiatives that focus on delivering better in-store shopping experience, top-line sales growth, margin enhancements, and cost reduction.","For the quarter, our enterprise same-store sales increased by 1.2%. Highlights for the Dollar Tree banner include total sales in Q4 increased 7.9% to $2.9 billion. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%. This was achieved through increases in both traffic and average ticket.","Gross profit margin improved 110 basis points over Q4 last year and fourth quarter operating margin was 16.4%, an improvement of 140 basis points over last year's 15%. And Dollar Tree\u2019s operating margin for the full-year in 2016 grew 130 basis points to 12.9%, a new record for Dollar Tree.","To share some of the highlights on the quarter, our top performing categories for the Dollar Tree banner include candy, seasonal, party supplies, snacks and beverages, toys, and household products. Sales performance was balanced between both our discretionary and consumables. We delivered positive same-store sales each month throughout the quarter.","November, which benefited from the Halloween shift, was our strongest comp month. And geographically Dollar Tree same-store sales growth for the quarter was very balanced as each of our operating zones delivered positive comps that exceeded 1%. Dollar Tree business continues to be strong, consistent, and growing. This represented our 36th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales, full-year operating margin historically one of our highest.","Our fourth quarter results validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers continue to shop for value and convenience. Highlights for the Family Dollar banner in the fourth quarter included our total sales increase of 2.2%, our same-store sales increase of 20 bps. Average ticket was up 30 bps and traffic was down slightly.","Gross profit margin improved 110 basis points over last year and operating margin was 4%, an improvement of 160 basis points over the prior year quarter. Our Family Dollar highlights for the quarter, our top performing categories for the Family Dollar included electronics, snacks and beverage, candy, men's apparel, and cough and cold supplies.","Our comp performance was driven by consumables. We delivered positive same-store sales in both November and January. November, of course, which benefited from the Halloween shift was our strongest comp month. And geographically Family Dollar same-store sales growth for the quarter was relatively balanced with our West and Northeast operating zones being the strongest.","We are now 18 months into our integration and we continue to make progress at Family Dollar around the key foundational elements that will drive our performance. Store table stakes focus on merchandising value and consolidation of shared services. Our efforts continued to be around customer facing initiatives that our shoppers continue to give us credit for, as we work to improve these across our base of 8000 stores.","Our customers are seeing cleaner, better merchandise stores. They have more compelling end caps with product they need for everyday basics and holiday wants. While we have more to do here, we are on the right track with our continued investment in the basics of our Family Dollar banner.","These customer facing programs to drive and share values throughout the store continue to build momentum across our smart way to save marketing programs. Our customers continue to respond to the value and savings across all of our foundations on delivering value for our Family Dollar customers. The smart way to save the strategy connects the values in our ad to the merchandising in our stores.","EDLP pricing on our everyday value, sale items that reflect the most meaningful value on key items are Dollar well items that drives the surprise and opening price points throughout our stores, compare and save to shut down our excellent value of our private brands, price drop, great value on the items, our customers buy most often and most recently smart coupons, the easy way to find additional savings.","Our customers are continuing to respond and embrace our smart coupons with sign-ups exceeding our projections since our Labor Day kickoff. For our regular shoppers, this program provides a no hassle shopping experience to find national and Family Dollar exclusive offers. For Family Dollar, it's a great way for us and our vendor partners to reach a demographic that is uniquely served by Family Dollar. It enhances the delivery of our smart ways to save messaging.","Another one of our foundational parts of our strategy for success is our focus on table stakes. At a high level, this includes our improved store standards and conditions, neat, clean, full, and recovered, merchandising relevance and energy, finding what I need at Family Dollar at a value I recognize, and customer engagement, it's our energy around Family Dollar friendly.","Our customers count on us all month long, but the first 10 days of the month are critical in our efforts to have our in stock on shelf recovered and end caps with compelling offers. Our focus here revolves around our efforts to have improved on shelf in stocks along with our operational teams improving our truck to shelf process back to the basics.","The convenience of our stores combined with our focus on improvements across the customer facing initiatives is foundational for an improved customer experience at Family Dollar. While we have more to do, our team at Family Dollar is motivated and energized to do the best to delivering value to our customers. They are unique in many ways and often under-served. Our stores serve a customer that counts on us and responds and we deliver value, customer service in a Family Dollar shopping experience that we're all proud of in the neighborhoods we serve.","Now, looking at real estate in the fourth quarter, we opened a total of 104 new stores, 47 Dollar Trees and 57 Family Dollars. We relocated or expanded 27 stores, 16 Dollar Trees, 21 Family Dollars and we re-bannered 8 additional Family Dollars to Dollar Tree for a total of 139 projects during the quarter.","We also added freezers and coolers into 86 Dollar Tree stores during the fourth quarter, bringing our total of Dollar Tree stores of freezers and coolers to 4788 stores. During the quarter, we closed 55 stores, 15 Dollar Trees and 40 Family Dollars. And we ended the fiscal year with over 14,000 stores, 14,334, 6360 Dollar Trees and 7974 Family Dollar stores.","For fiscal \u201816, we opened 359 new Dollar Tree stores, 225 Family Dollar stores for a total of 584, which exceeded our target of 550 new stores during the year. For 2017, our real estate plans include 650 new stores, 350 Dollar Tree and 300 Family Dollar stores, renovations at 250 Family Dollar stores. Cooler and freezer expansions in 300 Family Dollar stores and adding freezers and coolers to 400 new and existing Dollar Tree stores. As I mentioned, we are pleased with our progress, but there is much work in opportunities that lies ahead of us.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on Q4 performance and our initial outlook on Q1 in fiscal \u201817. Kevin?","Kevin Wampler","Thank you, Gary, and good morning. Total sales for the fourth quarter grew 5% to $5.64 billion. This was at the midpoint of the guidance range of $5.59 billion to $5.69 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 7.9% to $2.9 billion. And Family Dollar segment total sales increased 2.2% to $2.74 billion.","Beginning in our fourth quarter, the acquired Family Dollar stores are now included in our overall same-store sales. Enterprise same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.2%. Adjusted for the impact of the Canadian currency fluctuations, same store sales grew 1.3%.","On a segment basis, same store sales increases were 2.3% for the Dollar Tree banner and 0.2% for the Family Dollar banner. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization from Family Dollar and deal stores that have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. We estimate the incremental cannibalization impact to the Dollar Tree banner comp to be approximately 50 basis points for the quarter.","Gross profit for the combined organization increased 9.3% to $1.81 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin improved 130 basis points to 32.1% versus 30.8% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 37.5% during the fourth quarter, a 110 basis point improvement compared with the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Factors impacting the segment gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise cost due to higher initial mark-on and favorable freight costs and lower markdowns due to the deals conversions in the prior year. These were partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales.","Gross profit for the Family Dollar segment increased 6.6% to $718.5 million. Gross profit margin for the segment was 26.3% during the fourth quarter, compared with 25.2% in the comparable prior year period. Excluding the inventory step-up amortization of $15.9 million in the prior year\u2019s quarter, gross profit margin was 25.8% for Q4 of 2015.","Improvement was due to lower merchandise, freight, and shrinks costs, partially offset by higher markdown expense and increased distribution and occupancy costs. Consolidated selling, general, and administrative expenses in the quarter improved to 21.7% from 22% in the same quarter last year as a percent of net sales.","Q4 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales improved 30 basis points to 21.1% from 21.4% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Decreases in payroll costs, legal fees, depreciation and advertising were partially offset by increases in store wages and retirement plan contributions.","SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment was $608.1 million and as a percent of sales was 22.2% compared to 22.7% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. The improvement was driven primarily by lower payroll costs including incentive comp, stock comp expense, worker's comp insurance and health insurance costs, as well as lower legal and depreciation expense.","These decreases were partially offset by higher store hourly payroll, advertising, and repair and maintenance costs. Operating income for the enterprise increased $586.5 million compared with $469.7 million in the same period last year. Operating margin increased to 10.4% for the quarter from 8.8% in last year's fourth quarter.","Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 140 basis points to 16.4% when compared to the prior year and the operating income for Family Dollar segment increased $45.1 million to $110.4 million, a 160 basis point improvement as a percent of sales when compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter.","Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $88.8 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense and $11.7 million of acceleration of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs related to our debt prepayment made in January. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35.3% compared to 35% in the prior year\u2019s quarter.","For the fourth quarter, the company had a net income of $321.8 million or $1.36 per diluted share compared to reported net income of $229 million or $0.97 per diluted share in the prior year\u2019s quarter. The current year includes $0.03 of expense for the write-off of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs incurred during the quarter as previously noted.","Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, our combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $866.4 million compared to $736.1 million at the end of 2015. Our outstanding debt is approximately $6.3 billion, a decrease of $1 billion from the prior year end. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 4.6% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 6.6%.","Inventory for selling square foot decreased 2%. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the first quarter. Inventories for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 4.6% from the same period last year and decreased 6% on a selling square foot basis.","We're pleased with the progress we're seeing on in-stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $113.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus $144 million in the fourth quarter of last year.","For fiscal 2017, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $760 million to $780 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores and remodels, including few development stores, our plans include renovating 250 Family Dollar stores in 2017, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to a total of 400 new and existing Dollar Tree stores, the expansion of frozen and refrigerated for 300 Family Dollar stores, IT system enhancements and integration projects, the start of construction of a new Dollar Tree banner distribution center, and to continue to build out of a new office building for the support centers in Chesapeake.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $155.5 million for the fourth quarter. This includes purchase accounting related costs of $17.9 million for favorable lease rights amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $174.9 million in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2017, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $610 million to $630 million. This includes $66 million for fiscal 2017 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases.","Before I speak to our assumptions included in our 2017 guidance, I want to outline the one-time or unique items that impacted our 2016 earnings by quarter. In Q1 2016 we had a one-time $0.09 per share benefit in our tax rate related to state tax planning. In Q3 2016 we had a one-time $0.09 per share benefit in our tax rate related to a reduction in state tax rate, which decreased the deferred tax liability related to our trade name intangible assets.","Also in Q3 2016 we incurred $0.09 per share in expenses related to our debt refinancing and lastly in Q4 of 2016, we incurred $0.03 per share in expenses related to our debt repayments. And outlook for fiscal 2017 includes the following assumptions. Fiscal 2017 includes a 53rd week. The extra week in the fourth quarter is expected to add $400 million to $430 million into sales and $0.19 to $0.22 to earnings per diluted share, both of which are included in our guidance.","Over the next two quarters, we will continue to experience a higher than normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps from our re-banner efforts. We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on states increasing minimum wages and general average hourly rate increases. We have budgeted higher import freight costs in a year ago starting in Q2 and higher diesel cost for the year.","Net interest expense will be approximately $75 million per quarter in Q1 through 3 and approximately $81 million in Q4 due to the extra week. Our guidance does not include any impact related to FLSA overtime regulation changes, which were postponed last November. Our guidance does not include a share repurchase as for 2017. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates.","Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 37.2% for the first quarter and 37% for fiscal 2017. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.5 million shares for Q1 and 237.7 million for the full year. For the first quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.26 billion to $5.35 billion and diluted earnings share in the range of $0.91 to $0.98. This compares to a reported $0.98 per diluted share from the prior year\u2019s first quarter or $0.89 per diluted share when adjusted for the one-time tax rate benefit of $0.09 per share related to state tax planning.","These estimates are based on a flat to low single digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.9%. For fiscal 2017, we are forecasting total sales to range between $21.94 billion and $22.33 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.56. These estimates are based on a flat to low single digit same-store sales increase and 3.9% square footage growth and include the benefit of the 53rd week occurring in Q4 of fiscal 2017 as previously noted.","I'll now turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Kevin. Again, I am extremely pleased with our solid performance for the fourth quarter and I'm proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. We continue to make meaningful progress with our integration plans. We believe that we are well positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increased value for our long-term shareholders.","Dollar Tree is now a diversified combination of a 6000 store chain and an 8000 store chain, each with its unique ability to effectively serve more customers through all types of markets. With a combination of these two great brands, we have great flexibility in how we choose to grow while expanding our opportunity to grow. We will continue to focus on providing greater values to our customers, while delivering superior returns to our long-term shareholders.","Recently I joined our combined merchandise teams on their post-holiday overseas buying trip. I was very pleased and encouraged by the results from this trip as we continue to develop business relationships, identify and secure tremendous values, improve our supply chain and quality control, while meeting our targeted margin thresholds.","We have developed valuable experience and expertise over the years and we are leveraging this for the benefit of our customers across all banners. In recent months, there has been an inordinate focus on the proposed border adjustment tax. We, like most other retailers, feel that the border tax would result in a significant burden to the consumer both through reduced choices and higher prices.","We're working with the National Retail Federation, Retail Industry Leaders Association, and the Americans for Affordable Products Group to express our concerns. At this early stage we cannot answer questions regarding potential impacts until we know what if anything is passed. But I do know that this for 30 years Dollar Tree has demonstrated its ability to adapt and react in managing our business effectively.","Over the past 30 years we have seen inflation in all-cost including product, labor, transportation, and real estate and we've been able to successfully maintain our dollar price point, deliver relatively consistent gross margins, and still provide tremendous values to our shoppers. As always, we will continue to employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined enterprise to improve communication, analysis collaboration and incentives.","We are confident that continuing to place our emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control, and greater customer satisfaction. The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve. It\u2019s powerful, flexible, and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of sales and earnings.","While after 30 years our price point at Dollar Tree stores remains $1, our operating margin continues to grow and leads the discount sector. For the full year 2016, our Dollar Tree operating margin improved 130 basis points to 12.9%. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history.","For 36 consecutive quarters we have delivered positive same store sales increases. Through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value no matter the state of the economy. In the fourth quarter, total sales increased 5%. Enterprise wide same store sales increased 1.2%, and operating margin improved from 8.8% a year ago to 10.4%. It all starts with our associates. Our merchandise teams and our field management and leadership teams are talented, experienced, energized, and incredibly motivated. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So, Bob, on same-store sales, what's the mindset around including flat at the low end of the flat to low single digit guide for this year? I guess any change in the competitive landscape or any change in the way that you view the Family Dollar productivity opportunity?","Bob Sasser","Matt, we're extremely excited about the opportunity. Productivity increases in Family Dollar and in Dollar Tree. But as we sit here first quarter looking out across the whole year, we have great confidence in our ability to implement and to execute our initiatives. We have great confidence in our models and our initiatives. Our value retail model is as good as it can be. I believe we're positioned exactly where we need to be as we go into 2017. So, it's not a lack of confidence.","It\u2019s more, just it's first quarter and we're looking out across the year. We're looking at our business. We're looking at some uncertainty out in the economic environment and some bits and starts. So, as a result we put all that together. We put what we know on page and then we put uncertainty and that's how we come up with our guidance. We want to always be fair and measured and make sure that we give you the best information we can possibly give you. As always we intend to continue to improve and exceed expectations where possible.","Matthew Boss","It's great. And then just a follow-up at the core Dollar Tree, so roughly 90 basis points of operating margin expansion this year almost 13% today, how would you rank the margin opportunity from here at the core Dollar Tree banner?","Bob Sasser","Well, there is still plenty of opportunity. There are some headwinds that we have in our ocean freight and some of the things that Kevin called out with diesel fuel higher now, but we've always been able to - as long as we can see it coming, we've always been able to manage around that and always drive our operating margin.","As you know, I've always said we're in charge of our gross margin. At Dollar Tree we go to market with two things in mind and our buyers are looking for the best value for the Dollar, for the customers at a margin we're willing to accept. So, we decide sometimes that we take opportunities. We find the market and we use those to drive sales. Sometimes we take it into our margin, but we're always in control of what we're doing.","So, we feel really good about our Dollar Tree margin. And again this is our 30th anniversary. It's 30 years, everything is a dollar, every increasing improvements in the business, still hitting some high watermarks at 12.9% operating margin and I think we can continue them.","Matthew Boss","That\u2019s great, best of luck guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could give an update on kind of where you are in synergies today and cost incurred to the synergies and then just an update on whether 159 is still the right run rate to think about for 2017?","Bob Sasser","Yeah, Karen, I think as we've said from day one, our expectation is to be able to achieve 300 million and hopefully exceed that at the end of the day and as we kind of broke that out, we kind of broke it out as 75 million the first year, 225 by the end of the second year and 300 million by the end of the third year. We think we\u2019re right where we need to be on track maybe just a little bit ahead.","So, I think that feels pretty good. The one-time cost to achieve, again we spoke a little bit to that last quarter and again when we originally talked to that, we talked about it being about half of that being operational expenses and half of it being capital expenses. I think at this point it's probably a little bit more on the CapEx side again, because of the re-banners we've done, the 300 re-banners, as well as the 200 deals re-banners, the system integration that's going on, the work around co-bannering, the Utah distribution center.","On the OpEx side, it's been a little less, but there has been some consulting professional fees and some various other costs there. But all of the other things we feel like we're well on target and we\u2019re going to be able to risk [ph] and work very hard to exceed that $300 million.","Karen Short","Great, thanks. And just a follow-up on the first quarter guidance, I guess the earnings guidance is a little lighter than consensus. Is there anything just to point to there?","Bob Sasser","Yeah, I don't know if there is anything specifically to point to. I think as we look at it, a couple of things, one, Q1 from the diesel cost perspective, it is the biggest change quarter-to-quarter. So, the diesel cost is about $0.02 of headwind in basically Q1. So, that's bigger than it is in any other one. And again I do want to make sure that people are comparing it to the adjusted number of last year of $0.89 as opposed to what was reported, because of the tax benefit of a year ago. But that's probably the biggest thing I would point out as diesel cost and otherwise I think, we feel pretty good about the number we have been able to put out there.","Karen Short","Great, thanks.","Operator","We will go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. You broke into positive comp territory for Family Dollar this quarter and as you continue to work on improving the store format, the up taking the merchandise et cetera. Is there anything we should keep in mind as to why that banner may or comp negative at some point during the course of the year? Or do you expect that to be kind of stable going forward?","Gary Philbin","Scot, this is Gary, good morning. The way I think about the business is got slight positive comp in Q4 and that was with of course there was positive growth in November and January and we made our plans for the year. The foundational things that we are putting in place, running better stores and that revolves around just having our products and stock, cleaner, fuller, the retail basic that we have been talking about there is a thing that I think started to deliver year-over-year better comps for us.","Some of the strategic things that we mentioned in the call, core expansion, we are starting a renovation firm, and those are things that will over time shift our fleet of stores from how they operate today to something different in future and maybe the third piece is we are really around the merchandising and the assortments. So as we think about what a Family Dollar customer needs and wants. Those are the longer term enhancements you will see as we go through fine cycles both on imports and in our domestic product.","So I take a look at the year and we are retailer, we always bullish, those who are doing the foundational things and help us stay more consistent with our progress on top line sales and then continue to work very hard on the things are going to drive margin and cost around the business to get certain growth trajectory on operating margin.","Scot Ciccarelli","Gary, given some of the competitive commentary whether it is Wal-Mart, Target, Dollar General et cetera, do you think there is going to have to be any kind of price adjustments at Family Dollar during the course of the years, that are really contemplating your expectations.","Gary Philbin","What we think we know is in our guidance. I think the current news that everyone is reacting too, clearly is in the grocery sector; it doesn\u2019t mean that we are not on the front of that. But our Family Dollar business is driven more by our convenience and controlling our own four walls. And those are things that we are focused on to stay in front of our 2017.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","And we will go next to Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Market.","Brad Thomas","Yes, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the some of the Family Dollar question and hoping you could just highlight a bit more in a way that you think you made the most progress from a daily execution blocking and tackling stand point and where you really want to focus the most in 2017? Thank you.","Bob Sasser","Brad thank you and I would thank you for the question because it gives me a chance to brag a little bit on our folks who work very hard on, really just the basics, but the hard work that goes into running our stores and where are we while we know we are not in the finished line but I would color it this way.","Our in stocks what our customers choose on the shelf is certainly better than where we started 18 months ago. In our efforts to catch up on some of the deferred maintenance and cleaning and basics that we need to run full clean recovered store are in place. Our operational teams are heavily focused on our consistency of providing that, day in and day out. And I commented on it but for our customers, it really revolves around first of month ready at Family Dollar, and that\u2019s a very important focus for us to gain consistency with our customer and tend to show up with our first of the month business and our share of snap that we take and so those are things that I would say we improved on, we have more work to do across all of those.","I\u2019m pleased with the efforts that our folks putting towards it. It is going to be one of the just basic table state conditional initiatives that we stayed with for several years. Because we always been able to find a way to improve as we start to be able to renovate some of our older stores, our customer store by store will see something that\u2019s different. And that\u2019s just as important when we are talking about the stores that serve their neighborhood. So I am encouraged as to where we are at, more to do be done. But it is consistent message and focus throughout the organization right now.","Brad Thomas","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","And we will go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to enquire about Duncan's hiring, if you can touch on that and then also if possible could you just describe in a little bit more detail, maybe the expectations on both comps end margins per banner. So to the extent that how should we be thinking about comps for FD over Dollar Tree? Is it 200 basis points spread between the two banners as we saw in the fourth quarter perhaps the top process over the rest of the year or could that spread narrow or widen and similarly on margins. Is there more opportunity or more pressure at the Tree segment versus FDO? Thanks","Bob Sasser","Hey Paul, this Bob, I will take the first part and in order to answer your question about Duncan let me take you back to about 18 months ago, when we paid the acquisition of Family Dollar. At that time if you remember there was no President at Family Dollar. The President had already left, I thought that when we made the acquisition that it was extremely important first day to have a President in place and Gary Philbin has been President at Family Dollar, my partner here for long time, stepped up and moved down to Mathews and on day one we had a President for Family Dollar in place to leave the team. He has done a terrific job energizing the team, communicating, building the initiatives, getting extraction on the business, planning up all the inventory, doing all the things to revitalize the marketing campaign, customer communication. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what Gary has done.","But I was still one President short, with that combination and as Gary went down to Mathews, we launched him into a national search company looking for a President of Family Dollar and we found Duncan. And I will tell you that Duncan, when we met, I knew that he was exactly right person to this job, his background, he had consumer products background. He had supermarket background. He had big time discount store background and he had demonstrated throughout his career, real ability to build store teams, build merchant teams, build organization and to drive success. So we are pleased to bring Duncan on board, Duncan has been down there just short period of time and I will tell you, he stepped on it and started up running.","If you talk to the folks down at Family Dollar, I think you would hear from them, that they really have engaged with Duncan and he has engaged with them in a positive way. So we are very excited about adding Duncan to the management team. In addition at this point in time, I brought Gary, we elevated Gary to Enterprise President and as Enterprise President Gary now has responsibilities for all of customer facing initiatives, all of merchandizing, all of store operations and real estate across both banners. Gary reports to me as does the shared services organizations report to me. That was sort of how this all began and we are really pleased to have Duncan on board, we are also pleased to have Gary in the new role.","I\u2019ll let Kevin speak to the second part of the question.","Kevin Wampler","Good morning Paul, from a big picture perspective in regards to comps, obviously from a Dollar Tree side of the equation we expect the capitalization we have seen from the re-banner process to dissipate as we go through Q1 and Q2 and really be pretty much done by the end of Q2, so the back half really shouldn\u2019t have any headwinds per say in the re-banners for the most of the parts. So that\u2019s a positive on that perspective.","I think on the Family Dollar side, we think it\u2019s been a little harder for us to forecast just in general I would say, this is from our rhythm standpoint at this point in time. So we take that into consideration, has been able to add more variability to the business. It doesn\u2019t mean we believe that they are not going to comp positive and able to be meaningful contributor at the end of the day. So I think the way we are going to look at is as we go forward as we are going to give you enterprise guidance and then when we report the quarter we will break it out and give you the two segments as well. So that\u2019s how we are thinking about it going forward.","Maybe a little bigger picture for the year from a - speaking to the kind of the moving pieces within in our P&L so to speak on a consolidated basis, we do expect to see improvement in our gross profit this next year, this year we just started I should say. Really we expect to mark on to continue to improve and both banners, we are going to work to lower our mark down as a percent of sales in our Family Dollar banner. We are continuing to see a little bit of geography chance from the stand point on Family Dollar banner. We talked about this in the last quarter in the sense of our process where we are getting our co-opt dollars in that in our first cost, that supposed to offsetting advertising, so you can have a benefit in growth profit to see advertising expense and SG&A go up but that\u2019s kind of geography difference.","We know some of those improvements are going to be somewhat offset by the higher freight cost that we already talked about, but in general we are expecting gross profit to improve. And on the SG&A side, I think we are expecting flattish to maybe slight improvement. I think the headwinds are SG&A and there is going to be pressure on store wages in both banners and again we got minimum wage increases in general average dollar rate, that are increasing more than what we have seen over the last probably four or five years realistically.","And then as well in SG&A we do have the advertising that I spoke to, that will be an increase year-over-year. Somewhat offsetting that then is we will expect lower depreciation based up on the range I gave this year at the mid-point of that range to be 620 million which compares to last year\u2019s actual of 637 million, so depreciation is actually going lower. So those kind of things as we look at that then if you look at our operating income, kind of that midpoint of our guidance, you would be looking at operating income, approximately 8.8% to 8.9% which is compared to the 8.23% that we reported on the press release today, so at midpoint still increase in the overall operating income if you go forward. So those are still some of the moving pieces in big picture as we move into 2017.","Paul Trussell","Thanks for the color.","Operator","We will go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder","Thanks for taking my question. I just had follow up on some of the pricing investment that was asked about earlier. If you look at your Family Dollar results, you allowed gross margin to go up decent amount in the last several quarters and comps has been slightly negative, slightly positive recently and I am just wondering philosophically do you think if you were to take some of that gross margin and reinvest in price particularly against the backdrop with any of the competitors are that you might see better comp results and then benefit from the flow through on that.","Gary Philbin","Hi Dan, it\u2019s Gary, one of the things you sort of pointed out with the question is the synergy does give some flexibility in our sector. We certainly monitor all of the price checks like everyone else and what is happening across sector but half of the channel as well. And over the last 18 months we have had a very mind full exactly where we are compared to each of the targets we have by market. Our answer to that has been smart way to say which gives us flexibility and maybe even more than that point to the way we show our offers to our Family Dollar customer.","And so we do see a customer that shops differently, imagine for some month before, clearly the big driver for us and so what on shelf and end camps and whether it is on sale or price drop and that\u2019s how we are approaching it. So looking forward we are going to watch everyone this year as we go under price checks and see what they are doing across shelves and react accordingly. But to some degree you know it is not new news, everyone [ph] has been waving their flag on saying they are going to bring value. We are in a sector that delivers that with the convenience of factor attached to it for a customers and that\u2019s how we are thinking about starting half of the year.","Dan Binder","And then just to follow up of this topic but again of course optimal question I know you can\u2019t say lot about impact tax but if one word to go through, are you strongly opposed to breaking the backload that would be smarter to just keep that level and engineer the product packaging and account so forth to that level.","Gary Philbin","Dan again as I said in my prepared remarks has been passed and we really need to see what it covers and how it is done and what rules are and all that. I am sure we will be able to respond accordingly to that. We have a lot of levers across both banners that we can do. I believe that pressure on the consumer is going to be and potentially it passed the way everybody is contemplating, it could be real issue for the consumer but as far as retailer where we judge as like everyone else and respond quarterly. And I will tell you this at Dollar Tree for 30 years we have been at dollar.","You talk about price point; I have been asked the question for long-long time among other issues as cost changes and expenses change and as the market change, inflation, deflation and the like. And we are able to manage that because we are able to manage our source at Dollar Tree as long as dollar is unit of currency I believe we can offer the best values and we got business. So let\u2019s wait till we get there but if it is past and if passed what rules are and then we will respond accordingly but I believe we have as much right as anyone to response and run a great business going forward. So it will be different but let\u2019s see what the rules are first.","Dan Binder","Great, thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Hi good morning Bob.","Bob Sasser","Good morning.","Dan Wewer","Can you talk about the 300 new Family Dollar stores you are opening in FY17 and what will be the different about these stores compared to the Family Dollar store you inherited perhaps any commentary about rural versus sub-urban versus urban locations, things you are doing different, anything different with the store layout, number of coolers, give us that some inside as to how you see the long term vision for this concept changing.","Gary Philbin","Hi Dan, this is Gary let me take a swing at it first. We are excited to have 300 stores in the renovations and what you are going to see is in the headline is, how do we drive a more productive store for our customers and Family Dollars. They really enhancing the shopping environment and you are going to see something that both drive traffic and enhance the customers shopping experience and especially on the discretionary side as well. And I am not going to give the blue print of everything that you will see out there but the model be in a small box style. We certainly know how to run our box growth in urban and rural and what we are going to drive is really categories and adjacencies that make sense in a Family Dollar and I think our opportunity is to find the categories that are consistently drive in traffic week in and week out. Which is not always been the case as the box has been developed over time and we certainly have the pieces to make that their shopping environment for our customer.","Some of that can be our consumables and frozen food and on the margin pieces and elements that we do on seasonal with regard to the same party department at Dollar Tree is by a long shot. But certainly our customers still have birthdays and celebrate seasons and those are things that we can enhance and shine up in our Family Dollar world and the difference that we really have is, we still have apparel. Apparel is a category that for us, we can win it. It has always been a matter of space and dedication that you give it within the store and so those are some of the items that when you combine with basic elements or smart ways to save sort of come to life in these stores in a way that show our customer categories, adjacencies and the items they need and want we think an exciting shopping environment, that\u2019s what these will look like. You\u2019ll see a slip with both urban and rural locations. We know we can be successful on both and you\u2019ll see that split, maybe not evenly between the two locations, but be fairly close.","Dan Wewer","Okay and then the second question. Most of the Family Dollar stores that we have visited, not all but most, the in-store standards are continuing to look a lot better than they did a year ago. Again I\u2019m sure that the same-store sales growth, you\u2019re hoping to be a bit better, there\u2019s been some discussions about pricing this morning. Our pricing surveys show your identical pricing is about 10% above Wal-Mart on consumable items. The gap widening because of what Wal-Mart is doing. With the addition of Duncan and his background at Wal-Mart that believe in using pricing to drive share, do you think that could be the callas that could - his addition could be the callas that leads the Family getting more competitive in pricing on branded items?","Gary Philbin","Well, I\u2019m gaining on it. I\u2019m enjoying. To have Duncan as a partner number one, Duncan\u2019s going to help us tremendously, I would tell you that. And I would recon what Bob said, his experience doesn\u2019t need me to polish it up, but -","Dan Wewer","Well, I was thinking in terms of pricing, with his background at Wal-Mart and using pricing promotional strategy to drive share. Do you think he\u2019ll have a stronger voice for Family Dollar making that change?","Gary Philbin","He\u2019s going to be impressive at Family Dollar. He\u2019s going to have a stronger voice as anyone at the table. Here is what I\u2019d like to think about and listen, the price checks - I got more than everybody out in the field. The way I take a look at the price checks and whether it\u2019s 10%, which I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re checking, but we react accordingly. And it comes across both on shelf, everyday pricing, rooted on EDLP, we need to show our weekly promotion when we put our ad out there. We want to show our customers savings on price drop, which are some of the things they buy most often. So it\u2019s a combination of all of those things. We go to market, was that actually a Family Dollar customer and so we\u2019re going to be mindful where a Wal-Mart is and certainly anybody in our sector. But we have more than one tool to go to and show our customer value in our store and that\u2019s how we think about it.","Dan Wewer","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We\u2019ll go to [indiscernible] equity research.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking my question and I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but when you look at 2017, do you think the mix shifts more into discretionary or do you expect consumables to stay just as strong as they are?","Bob Sasser","Well, I\u2019d say lower that - strong as they\u2019ve been. In my opinion the mix at Dollar Tree, you have two different banners here, so we\u2019re lot more discretionary on the Dollar Tree banner than the Family Dollar banner. My expectation is it will continue to grow both discretionary and consumable, but the mix is going to be pretty much - I think pretty much the same. At Family Dollar, I think there\u2019s an opportunity to sell a little more discretionary, we\u2019re going to still go after the consumable business, we want to be the place where our customers shop for the things they need every day. We want to be convenient, we want to have great values for our customers on all the things that they need, so we\u2019re not back and down on the consumable business. At the same time, we want to offer them more of the things that are discretionary at great values.","Gary mentioned some of the things and everybody has birthdays, our apparel business, our home business, we have I believe terrific opportunities at Family Dollar in driving more discretionary business than our home departments. So it\u2019s a good question, but it\u2019s at the high level that that would be my answer. As we get down and to walk into the store four by four, that\u2019s how we actually look at it and where we should expand, where do we have the opportunity to expand, what our customer tell us that they want more off, how are they responding to just when we expand a category and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re looking at.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Bob Sasser","Operator","And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Randy Guiler for any additional or closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, May 25, 2017. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Good morning everyone. This morning we announced Dollar Tree\u2019s results for the third quarter 2014. Comp store sales increased 5.9% in the quarter, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. This was on top of a 3.1% comp in the third quarter last year and marked our 27th consecutive quarter of positive comp store sales. Total sales grew 11.2% to more than $2.09 billion. Operating income increased by $29.7 million or 14.5%, and operating margin for the quarter was 11.2%, a 40 basis point improvement from the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Net income increased 13.6% to $142.4 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 19% to $0.69 compared with third quarter 2013 earnings of $0.58 per share. ","Year-to-date through three quarters of 2014, total sales were $6.13 billion. This is an increase of 9.3%. Comp store sales increased 3.9%. Operating income increased by $56.3 million to $678.4 million. Operating margin was 11.1%, net income was $406.7 million compared with $383.6 million last year, and earnings per diluted share were $1.96, an increase of 13.3% compared with $1.73 per share last year. ","I\u2019m extremely pleased with our third quarter performance. These results continue to validate that Dollar Tree is part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. Our strategy to increase the wow factor resonated with customers in the third quarter. Our merchants delivered product that exceeded the customers\u2019 expectations, and our stores delivered on our promise of a clean, fun and friendly shopping experience. Our focus continues to be on serving our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. Our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector while our values are better than ever and our prices, as always, are just $1 per item. Our customers know that at Dollar Tree, yes, you can afford it.","Comp store sales were consistent and steady as we moved through the quarter. Sales in the home, seasonal and basics divisions were tightly grouped and our sales increase was a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary product. Top performing categories included pet supplies, hardware, party, household products, and food. Additionally, sales performance in the third quarter was relatively consistent across the country, and all five zones achieved solid comp store sales increases with strongest comps in our southern zone.","Key events in third quarter include back-to-school with dominant displays in August, including pens and pencils and paper, glue, crayons, scissors - all the basic needs that you have to have to head back to class, and all priced at $1 or less. In September, store teams quickly transitioned the seasonal area to fall harvest and Halloween product. Virtually overnight, Dollar Tree became Halloween headquarters with major statements of Halloween dress-up, costume accessories, trick-or-treat buckets, bags and candy. Customers were thrilled with our displays of Halloween d\u00e9cor and party supplies. They responded with their purchases, and we were pleased with our sales results. ","Also in September, we celebrated our 28th anniversary at Dollar Tree and kicked off a two-month celebration event with the largest selection of bonus buys and wow items ever available to our customers in a short period of time. There were almost 200 different special value items available during the two-month event. Key categories were home cleaning, snacks, beverage, candy and food. High value private labels and national brands were represented throughout the event. Our offers were compelling and our customers were thrilled. Sales results were excellent.","Looking forward, we are well positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth, and improved profitability. We have many opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores, increasing the productivity of all stores, and further developing our new formats, new markets, and new channels as growth vehicles. ","In the third quarter, we opened 117 new stores and we relocated and expanded 18 existing stores for a total of 135 projects. Total square footage increased 6.8%. We ended the quarter with a total of 5,282 stores across 48 states and five Canadian provinces, and we\u2019re on track to achieve our opening plan for the full year, which includes 375 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 450 projects across the U.S. and Canada. As a reminder, square footage for the full year is planned to increase 7% over fiscal 2013.","In addition to new stores, we continued to execute our strategy to improve productivity in existing stores. This strategy includes category expansions. Our customers are finding more value as we continue to rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and eyewear, as well as home and household products. Customers are continuing to see more powerful and more relevant seasonal and party presentations enhancing their shopping experience. Our seasonal assortments are creating merchandise energy as our storefronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point.","Store associates are working diligently to provide greater customer engagement in our stores and especially at the front end to drive impulse and related item sales. Stores are keenly focused on providing value and a shopping experience that exceeds the expectations of every customer, every day. As always, our merchants and store teams are focused on being first-of-the-month ready with an increased emphasis on displays of basic consumable core items when more customers are shopping for their basic needs, and to satisfy basic needs and to enhance frequency of visit, we continue to expand our frozen and refrigerated category. In the third quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 133 additional stores. We now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,543 stores with plans to expand this important category to additional stores over time. While this category is lower margin, the product serves the needs of our customer, it is faster turning, more frequently purchased, and the increase in shopping frequency provides the opportunity to drive sales across all categories, including higher margin discretionary product.","In addition to new Dollar Tree stores in the United States, Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$ are key components of our growth strategy. In third quarter, we opened nine new Dollar Tree Canada stores, ending the quarter with a total of 205 Canadian stores. Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher value product, and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. There\u2019s an enormous potential for growth in Canada. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market will support up to 1,000 stores. This is in addition the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus addition growth in our Deal$ brand. Our goal is to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point. ","Our Deal$ format further extends our ability to grow. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, we have the opportunity to serve more customers with more categories and increase our overall unit growth potential. Deal$ delivers low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home products. The stores operate using a multiple price point strategy and they have the potential to generate higher store volume with a higher average ticket. We ended the third quarter with a total of 219 Deal$ stores. ","In addition to Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and Deal$, our online business at Dollar Tree Direct is growing in size and performance. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness, and attract more customers into more stores. In the third quarter, we launched our world-class local search solution. Local searches are done for a specific and usually more immediate reasons; as an example, this functionality will help people find Dollar Tree like never before via local search engines. Dollar Tree Direct also launched a new section on our website in the third quarter that houses all of our crafty and seasonal videos. You will find more than 25 short videos covering our exciting seasonal merchandise, from how to throw a great party on a tight budget to do-it-yourself craft videos. ","We continue to leverage social media to connect with customers. A few examples include our loyalty program called Value Seekers Club, which has grown 110% over the past 12 months, our email database which has grown to more than 1.4 million subscribers, and we now have more than 1.3 million fans on Facebook. Social media continues to provide tremendous opportunities to communicate about exciting events and great products, both in our stores and online. We\u2019re pleased with the year-over-year growth of both sales and visitors to our Dollar Tree Direct business. Please check us out at dollartree.com. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and share our outlook. Kevin?","Kevin Wampler","Thanks Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted third quarter earnings increased 19% to $0.69 per diluted share. We are especially pleased with our 5.9% comp sales performance, which was composed of a 4.7% increase in traffic and a 1.1% increase in average ticket. The comp strength was very broad-based by category across region, and through each of the three months in the quarter.","Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 34.6% during the third quarter compared with 35% in the prior year third quarter, a change of 40 basis points. The majority of the decrease was related to freight. Freight costs as a percentage of sales increased as domestic trucking rates were higher, reflecting the effect of the industry-wide driver shortage. Merchandise mix again negatively impacted margin; however as Bob mentioned, we have made strategic decisions to expand assortments focused on providing greater value to consumers in order to drive traffic and capture share. We continue to be pleased with the results we are seeing.","Partially offsetting headwinds from freight and mix were improved initial markup across many categories and leverage on occupancy costs. The higher IMU reflects continue improvements in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model. ","Excluding acquisition-related costs, SG&A expenses were 23.4% of sales for the quarter, an 80 basis point improvement compared with 24.2% in the third quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses represented 45 basis points of the improvement due to leverage from the same store sales increase, reduced store payroll due to improved productivity, lower healthcare costs, and lower workers\u2019 compensation expenses. Store operating costs improved 15 basis points due to lower store repair and maintenance expenses, and depreciation expense improved approximately 15 basis points as a percent of sales due to the leverage from the strong 5.9% same store sales.","Adjusted operating income increased $29.7 million compared to the third quarter last year. Adjusted operating margin improved 40 basis points to a third quarter company record of 11.2%. Year-to-date through the third quarter, our operating margin is 11.1%, the same as a year ago despite continued freight headwinds related to the domestic driver shortages in the trucking industry.","The tax rate for the third quarter was 36.6% compared to 36.9% in the third quarter last year. The reduction in the tax rate is due to the favorable adjustment from the completion of the 2013 tax returns.","Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled $407.6 million compared with $147.1 million at the end of the fiscal third quarter of 2013. Our consolidated inventory at quarter-end was 5.5% greater than at the same time last year while selling square footage increased 6.8%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot actually decreased 1.2%. Our inventory turn increased in the third quarter and we expect continued improvement in inventory turns for the full year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the remainder of 2014. ","Capital expenditures were $94.2 million versus $84.5 million in the third quarter last year. For the full year of 2014, we continue to expect consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $360 million to $370 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, the addition of frozen or refrigerated capability to approximately 460 stores, IT system enhancements, including information security, the expansion of our Joliette, Illinois distribution center, and the initial phases of work on our 11th distribution center. We have not yet announced the location of this distribution center, but we anticipate breaking ground in the first quarter of 2015 and having the facility open in Q1 of 2016.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $50.9 million versus $48.6 million in the third quarter of 2013, an improvement of approximately 15 basis points as a percent of sales. We continue to expect depreciation expense to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million for the year. ","Our guidance takes into account our actual performance for the first three quarters of 2014, as well as our visibility and forecast into the remainder of the year. Our guidance includes the following assumptions: we anticipate that freight costs will continue to be a headwind to gross margin, primarily as a result of driver shortages. Product margin will remain under pressure based on strategic decisions to invest in certain product categories, driving traffic and market share increases. This year, there is one additional selling day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which returns us to a more normal pattern than in 2013. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.1% for the fourth quarter and 37.8% for the full year. We continue to expect weighted average diluted share counts to be 206.6 million for the fourth quarter and 206.9 million shares for the full year. Additionally, we have not included any acquisition-related costs in our fourth quarter guidance as we cannot currently forecast the timing of when these costs will be incurred. ","Our outlook for the fourth quarter is consistent with our original forecast as we entered into the back half of this year. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we are forecasting sales in the range of $2.39 billion to $2.46 billion, based on low to low-mid single digit comparable store sales increase and 7% square footage growth. We anticipate that gross profit margin will continue to be challenged by year-over-year freight increases as well as our commitment to provide greater value to our consumers in this challenging macro environment. Diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition costs, are expected to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.14, an increase of 5% to 12% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. ","For the full fiscal year of 2014, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $8.52 billion to $8.58 billion based on a low to low-mid single digit increase in same store sales and 7% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $2.97 to $3.04, and this represents an increase of 9% to 12% over 2013 earnings per share of $2.72. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you Kevin. As a reminder, we will not answer questions related to or provide more detailed insight on the pending acquisition of Family Dollar. However, before I continue, I want to make a few comments. ","On November 7, Dollar Tree certified substantial compliance with the second request of the Federal Trade Commission. The current process with the FTC is what we expected many months ago. This is a large merger involving many stores and it simply takes time for the FTC to analyze the documents and data. We commend and very much appreciate the hard work and diligence of the FTC staff. ","These are two different and complementary strategies. Our single price point Dollar Tree stores sell very different products to a different customer base than the multi-price point Family Dollar stores. Our merchandise overlap is small and product in Dollar Tree stores is priced at one price nationally. Our concepts, merchandise and customers are very different. As a result, we are confident and expect the number of any divestitures will be less than the original divestiture commitment we made in the July merger agreement. This will not materially affect our business or results of operations.","To provide better clarity to the Family Dollar shareholders on the FTC process, the shareholders meeting to vote on the merger has been reset for December 23. I am pleased with the work that has been done on integration planning, and we are more excited than ever about the potential of the combined companies. We\u2019re continuing to work to close the transaction as soon as possible. As a reminder, this combination creates a large and leading discount retailer in the most attractive sector in North American retail. We\u2019re combining complementary business models across fixed and multi-price point strategies, targeting a broader range of customers and geographies. We see significant and immediate opportunities for operational improvement and near-term opportunities for synergies, all of which create opportunities for enhanced financial performance, improved growth prospects, and higher returns for our shareholders. We look forward to successfully concluding the acquisition and welcoming the Family Dollar associates to our team.","I\u2019m extremely pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance, and I\u2019m excited about Dollar Tree\u2019s future. In fact, this year we are on target to exceed 1 billion transactions for the first time in our company history. Initiative to drive comp store sales are finding enthusiastic acceptance with a consumer that continues to be under pressure to make ends meet. Our in-stock on basics is the best ever. Customers are finding more of the things they need and the things they want on each trip. Stores are first-of-the-month ready. When the customer has money in their pocket and they are ready to shop, we want to be ready with the product. We think of the first of the month as 12 additional holidays and we prepare them as such.","The expansion of wow items is providing customers with bigger sizes, bonus buys, and bigger savings throughout the store. Our category expansions in pet supplies, hardware, household supplies, food, electronics and party are driving solid sales increases. We continue to roll out frozen and refrigerated product to drive traffic to more stores. Our front entrances are well stocked with ever-changing assortments of seasonal products that add excitement and merchandise energy to the shopping experience. Our stores are full, fun and friendly with more customer engagement as we strive for the same experience for every customer in every store, every day.","This was a terrific quarter. Total sales grew 11.2% and we exceeded $2 billion in third quarter sales for the first time in company history. Our comp store sales increase of 5.9% was our best quarterly comp since fourth quarter of 2011. Importantly, sales were the result of increases in both traffic and average ticket. Our customers are shopping more frequently and buying more on each trip.","Sales came from across the store with solid comp increases in both consumables and discretionary products. Each of the three months in the quarter was solid single-digit comp sales positive and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $0.69 per diluted share. At Dollar Tree, our focus is on growing operating profit using a strategic approach to driving sales, managing gross margin, and controlling expenses. In the third quarter, excluding acquisition-related costs, we achieved a third quarter company record of 11.2% operating margin, up 40 basis points from the prior year.","We are a large and growing company with multiple platforms and room for growth. In third quarter, we opened 117 new stores, expanded and relocated 18 stores, and ended the quarter with 5,282 stores and square footage growth of 6.8%. The Dollar Tree brand is a benchmark of value for our customers and there is great opportunity to grow and expand Dollar Tree in the U.S. through more stores and more productive stores. We\u2019re building, expanding and improving the Dollar Tree Canada brand, the Deal$ brand is serving more customers with increased value on even more categories, and Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach to customers throughout North America.","During the third quarter, Dollar Tree celebrated its 28th anniversary. Through those years, we have grown steadily, built solid infrastructure, evolved from small stores to larger stores with broad assortments, and reinvented ourselves continually, yet we have remained true to our original concept - everything is still a dollar at Dollar Tree, and everything is a value. As I look to the future, I see a continuation of exciting opportunities. Our balance sheet is strong, the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. This has been tested by time and validated by history.","We remain committed to a concept that customers love and we\u2019re positioned for continued profitable growth for many years ahead. We have a vision of where we want to go and the ability to get there with infrastructure, capital, and most importantly a talented management team that has a long history of retail success. It\u2019s a great time to be Dollar Tree. Our inventories are clean and fresh, the shelves are full of the right product for Thanksgiving and the holiday season, and our values have never been better. ","Christi, we\u2019re now ready for questions about our third quarter.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We\u2019ll take our first question from Dan Wewer from RBC Capital Markets. ","Dan Wewer","Well actually, I\u2019m still at Raymond James. Bob, how you doing?","Bob Sasser","I\u2019m doing great. How about you?","Dan Wewer","Doing real well - thank you. So at the end of your comments, you noted that Dollar Tree is a very different concept. On every performance metric, Dollar Tree is widening its advantages vis-\u00e0-vis Family Dollar, Dollar General for that matter. I thought you did a great job of listing the reasons--you know, you said, quote, it\u2019s a great time to be Dollar Tree. So with that in mind, can you remind me as to what Dollar Tree can do to Family Dollar to turn around its performance? That\u2019s going to represent 55% of the revenues of the combined organization. ","Bob Sasser","As we stated in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re not taking questions related to our acquisition of Family Dollar. The Family Dollar shareholder vote is scheduled for December 23. We\u2019re eager to add the Family Dollar name to our portfolio, but I can\u2019t take questions about it.","I will tell you that we\u2019re excited about our business at Dollar Tree. Third quarter was a terrific result - we beat on every metric. Our strategy is working. Customers really are finding us as a way of balancing their budgets. They know that they can find things they need and things they want, and you know you can come to Dollar Tree and you can get what you want, things that you need, and it\u2019s a nice shopping experience. Our customers describe us as a fun shopping experience and they always find something that they didn\u2019t expect to find, and always at great value.","So we\u2019re different. Everything is a dollar at Dollar Tree and has been now for 28 years. No one else can say that they have the same price as 28 years ago. We\u2019re very proud of that. We\u2019re very proud of the brand image that we\u2019ve built with our customers. We\u2019re very proud of the execution, especially in third quarter that we\u2019ve just done.","Dan Wewer","Yeah, I totally agree with everything you just said. Let me ask the question this way - maybe Kevin, he\u2019ll let you answer it this way. Do you think that the performance advantage at Dollar Tree vis-\u00e0-vis the other two concepts just reflects it\u2019s a superior concept, or do you think it\u2019s execution that\u2019s accounted for Dollar Tree\u2019s widening performance gap?","Kevin Wampler","You know, I think as we think about it, you\u2019ve heard us say before, we focus on our business. We focus on what we can control, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always thought about our business. The dollar price point is a key differentiator at the end of the day. The customer loves it, and we focus on the customer. Again as we talk about our stores, it\u2019s about a fun, friendly shopping environment, associates that are friendly and greet the customer. A lot of our store people know the folks that shop in their stores on a first-name basis, they\u2019re regular customers. ","So I think there\u2019s a lot of that that goes into it, but again at the end of the day, it is our belief that it\u2019s focus on what we can control and then execute.","Dan Wewer","Okay, well I thought I would try. Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hey guys. I was thinking Dan replaced me for a second there!","Bob Sasser","Good morning.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning. Have you guys seen anything that creates concern for the fourth quarter sales performance? The reason I\u2019m asking is obviously third quarter results were very good, you\u2019re actually up against a pretty darn easy comparison in the fourth quarter, so I guess I\u2019m a little surprised the comp guide is low single digits, especially with gas prices coming down, which I would think would be a nice incremental positive for you guys.","Kevin Wampler","Well you know, I think as we think about the guidance, just big picture, Scot, I know you folks like to look at these two-year stacks and things like that, and the two-year stack might suggest that we should be doing a 7 comp in the fourth quarter, which obviously would be a tall task for anybody at the end of the day. But as we look at the guidance, we expect--you know, we\u2019re going to ring the register every time we can during the quarter, and we think we\u2019ve got a good merchandise plan. The stores look great - hopefully you all get to have a chance to get out and get in our stores and see our holiday merchandise as we move through the season. ","I think in the guidance standpoint, we still expect headwinds from freight are going to continue to be there. We would expect a little leverage on SG&A. I think the other thing in the big picture that I want everybody to realize is we have not changed our guidance from what we gave originally in February, other than to adjust for the actual results and the acquisition cost. What we\u2019ve got to remember is the February guidance did not contemplate the level of freight headwinds that we\u2019ve faced during this year, so we\u2019ve been able to offset that by driving sales and controlling costs and creating leverage on expenses. So I think that\u2019s been a big part of this, and I think it really kind of points back to what you\u2019ve heard Bob and I say before, that is if we can see it coming, we can react accordingly. We can make plans within the business to work to mitigate some of these increases that we may see in certain line items.","I think there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces, but I think really given some of the cost pressures we\u2019ve seen on freight, I really feel pretty good about our performance this year, but also as we look to guidance. At the end of the day, the guidance is there. We\u2019re always going to look to outperform if we can, but obviously if you ask the people in Buffalo right now, you don\u2019t know what the weather is going to be, so there\u2019s a lot of unknowns as we continue through the quarter.","Scot Ciccarelli","Kevin, a lot of those issues, though, are really on the cost side as opposed to the top line. Are you guys impacted by port disruptions or anything else, are you off to a softer start, or is this just kind of general conservatism because you never know when it comes to the holidays?","Bob Sasser","We\u2019re excited about fourth quarter. I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve got terrific plans. We\u2019ve got the best merchandise plans ever. We\u2019re excited about it, and frankly our momentum continues in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s just begun - you know, we\u2019re only a couple weeks into the quarter, so hard to declare victory but I feel really good about fourth quarter. Kevin shared with you how we plan our guidance. We try to include everything we know about our business in our guidance, and then we always consider things we don\u2019t know that might happen, so our guidance is pretty good. I think you can count on us to give the best thought at it.","He\u2019s right, though, because we\u2019ve beat--through third quarter, we\u2019ve beat and we\u2019ve added that to our guidance that we gave in February, and that was before we knew of the pressures that we were going to have on our freight. So we\u2019ve overcome the pressures that we had from freight and still beat, and have raised our guidance full-year because of the beat. So I think that\u2019s special, frankly, because it speaks to the execution of the model, it speaks to the management team\u2019s ability to respond by driving sales, by managing costs, by managing flow of product to the stores. It really was a terrific quarter.","Our forecast for fourth quarter is our best forecast for the things we know. It has no bearing on how excited we are. As we enter, the excitement for fourth quarter is huge. Our merchandise plans, I\u2019ll just share with you, it\u2019ll take a little more to get done but we have terrific new product in our fourth quarter. We\u2019ve got cell phone and tablet accessories for a buck - all for a buck, trend-right, fashion-right, things you find in other retailers for much more than a dollar. We\u2019ve got--by the way, with the cold weather, our winter wear is the best it\u2019s ever been. We\u2019ve got the Snugadoo socks for the ladies and the gloves and the hats and the scarves, and they\u2019re all just a buck, so we\u2019re excited about the winter wear that we have. Our catering assortment, the party business, all the catering supplies that we sell, we\u2019ve expanded that assortment for holiday. It\u2019s the right time, it\u2019s the right product. We\u2019ve got the plated utensils, we\u2019ve got the plated--silver plated matching plates, we\u2019ve got the plated wine and champagne glasses for all your parties for the holidays, and it\u2019s going to be terrific merchandise in our stores. I could go on and on about the new items and the new product that our merchandise team is bringing to bear, but we are excited about our holiday and our Christmas sales for that reason. It\u2019s all about merchandise, it\u2019s all about stores, and it\u2019s all about the customers.","Scot Ciccarelli","All right, thanks a lot, guys. Very helpful.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I\u2019m interested in the merchandise margin and how the underlying margin flowed this quarter, being better than it was last quarter. Was it that you didn\u2019t see as much of a mix shift pressure to some of the more value-oriented items that you added, or was there some other offset that drove what seemed like an improvement there?","Kevin Wampler","Michael, as we looked at it, I think part of it is a little bit of mix in the sense of the discretionary goods. We did a little bit of a benefit in the sense Halloween falls in the third quarter. It was a large discretionary category for us as we moved through the quarter. I think, again, it\u2019s always a balance at the end of the day, providing great value. Doesn\u2019t mean we had any less of the national brands. You heard us talk about the fact that we had the best anniversary sale ever with 200 items, bonus buy items, with just absolutely fantastic results for us. So we look at those things.","So again, it\u2019s always about a balancing act, the discretionary product very, very good, as was the consumable product, but we just didn\u2019t see quite the same effect that we saw in the second quarter. Again, it\u2019s always going to be that little give, a little take, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always looked at our business.","Michael Lasser","On the freight side, obviously the labor shortage still seems to be an issue, but are you seeing some relief from lower fuel prices, and do you think that that will be an offset over time?","Kevin Wampler","Well, it has the potential to be helpful, obviously, so let\u2019s talk about a couple different metrics here. For the third quarter, the average diesel price was down $0.13 to last year, and compared to how we had forecasted it in our guidance, it was really only about $0.02 different, so it was really not a big differential there. Bigger picture as we think about diesel, the metric I\u2019ve pointed to in the past is that if diesel was down $1 for the full fiscal year, it would be a benefit of about $0.10 to earnings to us. There should be a little bit of help in Q4 because of the differential between a year ago and where we\u2019re at today. It will be a little bit more pronounced than the $0.13 we saw in Q3, but it has to move quite a bit to have a significant effect on the overall cost because fuel is just one component of the overall trucking rate that we end up paying.","Michael Lasser","That\u2019s very helpful. Let me just add one last one, longer term in nature. You have $1.25 price points in Canada. Maybe you could talk about what your learnings are from that and how they are applicable to your model in the U.S. and the flexibility you would have with your price points in your core Dollar Tree business over time. Thank you very much.","Bob Sasser","You know, the $1.25 in Canada is Canadian dollars, so on a conversion rate a Canadian dollar is around $0.89, something like that - $0.87 to $0.89. So we charge the $1.25 in Canada, and first of all, that was the price when we bought Dollar Giant, which was the company we bought, so we left that the same. But we left the $1.25 price because as the value of the product that we\u2019re selling in Canada as it relates to the U.S. product, we\u2019re selling a lot of the same product so in Canada with the conversion, you actually need the $1.25, or need higher than a dollar to make the margins work. Also, the costs are--cost of doing business in Canada is a little higher.","So we have a lot of the things in Canada that we sell in the U.S. We add to that certain product that we source in Canada or that we source especially for Canada for the $1.25 product, and again we\u2019re having success building the brand. We\u2019re investing in the business, we\u2019re investing in new stores and infrastructure there, and have been and will continue. We\u2019re pleased with where we\u2019re going with Canada.","I wouldn\u2019t expect us to raise the price at Dollar Tree to $1.25 in the long--in the near term, but the long term. In the U.S., everything is a dollar, and Dollar Tree resonates. We\u2019ve built that brand, we\u2019ve proven that we can run it over time. Our margins are better, our values are better. Everything is a dollar at Dollar Tree, so we don\u2019t have any intentions of raising our price in the U.S. to $1.25.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you so much and good luck with holiday.","Bob Sasser","Thank you very much. You too.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. Just want to touch base on Canada and Deal$ stores. You certainly alluded to them earlier, but if you can just give a little bit more detail on the performance of those two smaller segments.","Bob Sasser","Yeah, I\u2019ll try to give you some color on the Deal$ and the Canadian stores. We had nice comps in the quarter in our Deal$ - I\u2019m just going to talk about Deal$ first. Strongest comps at Deal$ were in the southeast, followed by the midwest. Our average transaction was up in the quarter at Deal$ stores - I was pleased with that. Comps by division, again they were strongest, and our general merchandise comps were the strongest, followed by our seasonal and then our basic. We had four big merchandising events for the quarter in Deal$ versus the three that I spoke to at Dollar Tree. At Deal$, we had the back-to-school event, Halloween event, our anniversary event, and also early opening of Toyland because we have a little bit different toy business in our Deal$ stores. ","Speaking to those just a little bit, we had a strong back-to-school season in our core stationary departments and really an exceptional year in selling backpacks as we continue to surprise our customers with great values for that type of product. Our stores, again, made a quick transition from back-to-school into our fall and harvest and our anniversary sale. Our Halloween business, our candy sales were strong for the candy season. We had particularly strong seasonal sales in that category. We featured more brands than last year and the consumer reacted enthusiastically to that expanded offering.","In the anniversary sale, this event featured many bonus branded value packs. Some examples were Dawn value packs and Softsoap and Lysol, and Lysol tub and tile bonus packs. We had General Mills bonus cereal sizes and a pretty broad array of bonus buys and wow items throughout the period of time. All of this was prominently featured, supported by our circular events, and additionally we were able to support these products and the manufacturers FSIs in our stores, always trying to create more value opportunities for our customers.","Lastly, our Toyland opened earlier this year, so we opened up that in the fourth quarter, featuring more favorites from the name brands - Mattel and Hasbro and other major toy manufacturers. We still are focused on this great assortment of $5 toys that we continually offer each year, but this year\u2019s assortment is even larger. We continue to grow our GM and our seasonal departments at a faster rate than our consumables, but we\u2019re focused on offering more products and a broader mix of everyday items to help make our customers\u2019 shopping trips more efficient.","Talking about the mix, the consumables was over 60% of the mix at Deal$ for the quarter. That\u2019s been about what it\u2019s been running. Our average ticket at Deal$ for the quarter was $9.73 - that\u2019s higher than our Dollar Tree average ticket, as you might expect. We\u2019re selling more and more of items above a dollar at our Deal$ stores. The average ticket on items greater than $1 was $14.49, so the idea of driving a higher average sale for our customers, offering more value on more products, seems to be getting traction. Fifty-some percent of all transactions had items greater than $1, and greater than $1 items represented 50% of our Deal$ total sales. ","So a good quarter in Deal$, really executing on the brand, and we can do better and we can continue to improve, and we\u2019re learning all the time on the new concept. We\u2019re following our customers closely and trying to give them more of the things that they want.","In Canada, our comp sales were driven by both average ticket and traffic. Top categories, top departments in Canada were our food department, followed by snacks and beverage, and then our floral department - I\u2019m speaking in terms of comp sales increases. Our store count for the quarter, there were 205 stores in Canada, nine new stores opened in Q3, 27 new stores have opened year-to-date. We\u2019ve run more and more promotions throughout the quarter in Canada. We had a compare and save program with six compare and save events, almost 50 items that included special buys of name brands and private label merchandise. In conjunction with these compare and save programs, we had special signing, we changed these items throughout the quarter. We continue to refine our seasonal business in Canada, and we see an opportunity to own the seasonal business at the $1.25 Canadian dollar price point, just as we do in the U.S. at a dollar.","Paul Trussell","Thanks a lot for that color, Bob. I appreciate it. Just circling back quickly to margins, Kevin, you mention in your 10-Q this morning that payroll leveraged by about 45 basis points, operating costs leveraged by 15 BPs. Is there anything as we look forward into 4Q timing-wise that you think might alter the landscape there? And then in gross margins, did you or could you quantify the actual impact of freight and merchandise mix in basis points, please?","Kevin Wampler","Yeah, so your first question really related to the SG&A, and you know we had terrific results as it relates to SG&A in the third quarter with about 80 basis points of leverage, which is probably even a little more than we might have expected. As I\u2019ve said, if you go back and you look at first quarter on a 2 comp, we\u2019ve got 40 basis points of leverage in SG&A, and I said it was probably--you know, maybe more than we would expect on a normal basis. So there\u2019s always gives and takes at the end of the day.","We did have, as you said, store payroll, we leveraged that. When you do a 6 comp and you\u2019re not planning for a 6 comp necessarily right out of the box, you will definitely tend to gain a little momentum there. We talked about healthcare costs being one of the benefits this year. If you remember a year ago at this time, we were actually talking about healthcare costs being up. As a reminder, we\u2019re self-insured basically, so last year we had more large unusual claims than normal. This year, while we\u2019ve had some, they haven\u2019t been to the same extent, so you get a little bit of dichotomy there year-over-year. So I think as we go--we probably got a little bit more leverage in the third quarter than maybe I would have even expected, so obviously guidance doesn\u2019t plan it to that extent going forward, not surprisingly.","On the gross margin side, as far as the freight, the freight was really the majority of the change. The increase, pretty much the majority of that was freight. As we said, there was some other pluses and minuses. Mix was a little bit negative, IMU a little bit positive, and a little bit of occupancy benefit leverage. So freight was really the driver of the decrease.","Paul Trussell","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","We have time for a few more questions. We\u2019ll go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer","Good morning everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Your S-4 had some planning assumptions for 2015 and 2016, which included an acceleration in new store growth and improvement in gross margin. I realize that that wasn\u2019t guidance, but I\u2019m wondering if you could talk to the thought process behind those assumptions.","Kevin Wampler","Yeah Matt, I think you\u2019re exactly right - they\u2019re not guidance. We have not obviously given guidance to 2015 or thereafter at this point in time. Those are based upon certain plans, but again don\u2019t look to them as guidance. We\u2019ll obviously give you some guidance to 2015 in about three months from now, and I think we\u2019ll be able to speak in more terms then.","Matt Nemer","Okay. Then November, I think, was the weakest month last year in the fourth quarter. Is it fair to assume that you\u2019re running stronger than the Q3 comp so far this quarter? Is that a reasonable assumption?","Bob Sasser","Well I think November was affected by a calendar shift last year, a Thanksgiving shift, so last year was one of those bad calendar years By the time you get to the end, it all sort of comes out in the wash, but I wouldn\u2019t look at the trend versus November as being relevant because the calendar shift this year is much more normalized. I think we have one more day between--in December between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and it\u2019s in December.","Matt Nemer","Okay, then just lastly, any thoughts on the freezer or cooler rollout over the next 12 months? Will it accelerate, decelerate, about the same? ","Kevin Wampler","I think this year, as we\u2019ve said, 460 freezer and cooler projects, installs. A larger portion of the installs are going into new stores than they were a few years ago. As a reminder, the things that limit us from adding freezers and coolers to a store could be store size. If it\u2019s not bigger than 8,000 square feet, it\u2019s hard for us to have the room to do a good job with our freezers and coolers. In some instances, we\u2019re restricted from having freezers and coolers by other retailers in the shopping center where we\u2019re at, and then we typically have a sales volume hurdle that we apply as well within the mix. ","So we love to add the freezers and coolers - as we\u2019ve said, it drives traffic and as we\u2019ve said historically, we tend to see a 5 to 10% lift on the store, but that\u2019s not just in the consumable side, it\u2019s across all categories. So it\u2019s been a very good driver of sales on an overall basis and preconceived trips by our consumers, so it will continue to be an important part of how we look to go forward.","Matt Nemer","Okay, thanks guys. Have a great holiday season.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, same to you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our last question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","","Meredith Adler","Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning. Congratulations on a very nice quarter. A lot of my questions have been asked, but I\u2019d like to just talk to you a little bit about real estate. When you talked about your capex, you reiterated the fact that you\u2019re spending money on--why did my mind just go blank?--fee development. I\u2019m assuming that the fee development is for standalone stores or stores that you are building yourself - that\u2019s what it means. Is there some kind of a shift, even a modest shift in the real estate for the Dollar Tree stores, or does that spending tie to Canada or Deal$?","Kevin Wampler","I think fee development is part of our overall growth strategy, and we like fee development from the standpoint that sometimes within a retail node, there\u2019s just not inline space available, and sometimes we can find a parcel of land that\u2019s in a good location, give us a lot of exposure to the retail traffic. It allows us to build a box that we really like - you know, a 10,000 square foot box. It lays out our linears really well and our adjacencies for our merchandising, and it really allows us to put our best foot forward. The other thing, because we control a piece of land, we obviously are not restricted from having freezers and coolers, so we can have a nice freezer and cooler presentation, and what we\u2019ve seen over the portfolio that we\u2019ve built to this point, which is still a very small subset of the total, is that they perform very well from a sales perspective. We really like what we\u2019ve been able to do there.","So they do continue to be a part of the way we look at our real estate strategy. Again, now it\u2019s more capital to do that, but in this case when we have the capital, it\u2019s just a nice way to go, and obviously a lot of those continue to grow at the rate that we\u2019d like to grow, which is that 7% square footage growth or a little more. So I think that\u2019s the way we think about it, Meredith.","Meredith Adler","You did mention that when you have a standalone store, it\u2019s in a retail node where there is a lot of other retailers. Do you think that the experience with fee development stores allows you more sites to open up? Are you restricted kind of the way you have been by the number of heavily traffic shopping centers?","Kevin Wampler","I think it\u2019s just another avenue of growth. It\u2019s another arrow in the quiver, so to speak, on the way to open stores. When you\u2019re opening, you\u2019re doing 450 projects a year, in-line space is not always available where you\u2019re looking at it, where you\u2019re looking to grow, where we don\u2019t have stores, as the real estate team works through the optimisation plans of looking at where we have opportunities to open stores. So it\u2019s becoming an important aspect of the way we look at it, and as we\u2019ve said, what we really like is the fact that we get a really good-looking store that to this point have performed above average from a sales per square foot and a pro forma basis. So that tells us that we\u2019re doing something right.","Meredith Adler","But you\u2019re not going to up your 7,000 target?","Kevin Wampler","We haven\u2019t at this point in time. I think it\u2019s there to be looked at, it\u2019s something we think about. We haven\u2019t updated that number in probably--","Bob Sasser","Ever. Meredith, we\u2019ve been saying that for 15 years, I guess. It\u2019s probably time to--we were just talking about that, it\u2019s probably time to go back and revisit that because the world has changed. We\u2019ve changed our stores, we\u2019ve changed the way we go to market and we serve more customers now, and the 7,000 stores was Dollar Tree stores. Our Canadian stores now, that\u2019s 1,000 store potential, so that brings it to 8,000 stores, and then the Deal$ stores increases that number. But it\u2019s probably time to go back and do some work on that.","It\u2019s going to end up being--it will be more potential than less potential, though. I wouldn\u2019t be able to quantify that yet, but it is probably time to revisit that number. I don\u2019t know how many years we\u2019ve been saying that, but it\u2019s been a long time.","Meredith Adler","Yeah, it has. Thank you.","Kevin Wampler","Thank you, Meredith.","Operator","That does conclude our question and answer session today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Randy Guiler for any additional or closing remarks.","[end of Q&A]","Randy Guiler","Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call, and especially for your continued interest in Dollar Tree.

Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in our business. Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of the year.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Unless otherwise noted, all net income and earnings data presented today will exclude the impact of the Ollie\u2019s transaction.","At the end of our planned remarks, we will open the call to questions which we ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up question if necessary.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, our President and CEO. Bob?","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Tim. Good morning everyone. This morning, we announced our sales and earnings for the third quarter of 2012. Total sales increased 7.8% to $1.72 billion, driven principally by increases in traffic. Our comparable store sales increased 1.6% compared with a 4.8% increase last year and an 8.7% comp the previous year.","Earnings for the third quarter were $0.68 per diluted share. This includes $0.17 from the sale of our interest in Ollie\u2019s. Excluding the sale of Ollie\u2019s, our earnings for the third quarter were $0.51 per share. This represents an 18.6% increase over last year\u2019s $0.43 per share and was at the high-end of our $0.47 to $0.51 range of guidance.","Operating margin for the third quarter 2012 was 10.7%, an increase of 40 basis points over the third quarter last year. Net income rose 48.6% to $155.4 million versus $104.5 million last year. Excluding the income derived from the sale of Ollie\u2019s, net income rose 12.2% to $117.3 million.","Year-to-date, through three quarters of 2012, total sales were $5.15 billion, an increase of 9.9% and comp store sales increased 3.9%. Year-to-date operating income has increased by $76.5 million; operating margin was 10.8%, an increase of 60 basis points compared with the same period last year.","Net income rose 30.0% to $390.7 million, and earnings per share were $1.69, an increase of 37.4% compared with $1.23 per share reported last year. Excluding the income derived from the sale of Ollie\u2019s, net income rose 17.4% to $352.6 million, and earnings per share were $1.53, an increase of 24.4% compared with $1.23 per share reported last year.","Sales increases in the third quarter came from growth in both basic and variety categories with basic consumable categories growing at a slightly faster pace. Our top performing categories included housewares and home products, healthcare products and food and beverages. Customer responded enthusiastically to our Halloween seasonal product and our sales in the third quarter met expectations. Sales were particularly strong in Halloween Home D\u00e9cor. Seasonal changes were executed in a timely manner and we\u2019re now ready for fall, Thanksgiving and holiday season. In terms of the sales cadence in the third quarter, comps were positive every month and we saw a sequential improvement from August through October.","In terms of geography, performance in the third quarter was relatively consistent across the country with the highest comps coming from the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and New England followed closely by the Southwest and the Southeast. Dollar Tree remains a destination for high value consumer products and customer traffic was up throughout the quarter. When customers are in our store shopping for the basics, we give them every reason to stock up on our terrific assortment of high value and high margin variety merchandise. Even in a difficult economy, at Dollar Tree you can still splurge everything only $1.","Looking to the future, we are excited about our growth potential and continued relevance to the customer. Over the next several years, it\u2019s likely that consumers demand for value will continue to grow and intensify. Dollar Tree is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend. Our goal is to provide more value to a broader range of customers. And we are doing this in many ways, by opening more stores, by opening better, more productive stores and by developing new formats, new markets and new channels.","During the third quarter this year, we opened 111 new stores and relocated and expanded another 16 stores. Through three quarters of 2012, we have added 298 new stores and expanded or relocated 81 stores.","Selling square footage has increased 7.1% and we ended the quarter with 4,630 stores. We are on-track with our new store opening plan for the full year 2012 which includes 315 new stores and we have surpassed our plan for 75 relocations and expansions in 2012. We now expect to complete more than 395 total projects across the US and Canada in fiscal 2012.","I am particularly pleased by the productivity of our new stores; sustained improvement requires a coordinated effort across the organization, it requires a strategy and it requires team work between real estate, merchants, planning, stores and logistics. Our teams are concentrated on improved site selection, on right sizing our stores, expanding our assortments, improving staffing and building the bench of qualified store management and on opening new stores earlier in the year. We believe these are the key elements to increasing our new store productivity and we are having success. I am very pleased to report that average new store productivity has increased in each of the past six years and the trend has continued through the third quarter 2012.","Efforts to increase sales per square foot are not limited to new stores and elements of the strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout chain. In all stores, we are developing more powerful season of presentations; stores are emphasizing more effective customer engagements and working to drive sales of related items for a cross merchandizing and suggestive selling. We are expanding assortments of the front end of our stores to create more merchandized energy and to drive impulse sales and merchants to expand in our assortments in candy, stationery, health and beauty care and home and household products, which was our fastest growing category in the third quarter.","As part of our strategy to broaden assortments, our expansion frozen and refrigerated product continues. We installed freezers and coolers in 67 additional stores in the third quarter and now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,467 stores. We remain on scheduled to roll this product up to a total approximately 325 installations for the full year.","Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats, the expansion of our geographic reach and the development of additional channels of distribution to serve more customers. Specifically, that means Deal$, Dollar Tree Canada and Dollar Tree Direct. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unique growth potential. ","Deal$ delivers low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, Deal$ were able to serve more customers with more products at value prices everyday. Customers are responding favorably to the strategy, customer awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing and the concept is building momentum. ","Overall in the third quarter as in the past several quarters comp store sales in our Deal$ stores continued to lead the company. We are excited about the growth potential of Deal$ and particularly the opportunity that it provides to grow profitably in the higher cost of operation in urban markets. ","We ended the quarter with a total of 194 Deal$ stores. Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. We initially entered the Canadian market through the acquisition of Dollar Giant stores in November of 2010. Our goal is to be the leading retailer in Canada at a single price point of $1.25 just as we are in the US at the $1 price point. ","Last year, our first full year we installed retail systems. We integrated processes, merchandise assortments and store teams and we laid the foundation for future profitable growth in the Canadian market. Just one year ago in the third quarter of 2011, we completed the installation and training of store level POS and enterprise-level merchandising systems. ","Today for the first time we have consistent year-on-year data on which debates our sales and assortment plans. We have visibility to our own hand, own order and sales along with the trailing history by store and by SKU. These are all key factors in the management of an efficient supply chain and improving customer satisfaction. ","Merchandising teams are integrated to leverage Dollar Tree\u2019s buying power. This has been a big transition but customers are beginning to find broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We expect this to gain momentum as we move through the holiday season and beyond. ","Our focus is on more efficient store operations, continued building of store teams and improved product flow to the stores. We are working very hard to increase service level and in stock position of basic products while improving the shopping experience for a more powerful seasonal presence and a higher level of merchandise energy. ","Meanwhile we are expanding our Canadian store base, we opened 12 new stores in the third quarter, 30 stores year-to-date and we ended the quarter with a 129 Canadian stores. We had begun the year with a plan to grow our Canadian store base approximately 25% under the Dollar Tree brand. We will likely exceed this plan and end the year with 135 stores in Canada. ","In addition, we've rebranded all of the former Dollar Giant stores in Ontario to $3.10 of this year and we will do the same for stores in the western provinces in 2013. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to a 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is an addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. ","I'm extremely excited about the opportunity for Dollar Tree in Canada and proud of what has been accomplished in a short period of time. Our current commitment to build infrastructure, develop store teams and improve the consistency of our offering across the chain will be worth the efforts. ","Dollar Tree Direct our e-commerce business continues to grow. This additional channel of distribution provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into the stores. ","Traffic exceeded 4.5 million unique visitors in the third quarter, that's a 19% increase over the third quarter of last year. Additionally, over 28 million e-mails were sent to individual consumers, businesses and organizations. We're expanding the available market to more consumers in several ways. First, Dollar Tree Direct now has over 2,600 items available online including 825 items per sale via our website that can be purchased in less than case quantities, an increase of over 65% versus the same time last year.","Additionally, we continue to work to enhance the customer experience on their mobile device, improving the ease of navigation and speed on our mobile e-commerce site. Over 1.5 million people chose to interact with Dollar Tree via their mobile devices during the third quarter. Through these initiatives, Dollar Tree Direct is gaining customers every quarter and I am pleased with their progress. Investments in new stores, more productive stores, additional formats and expanded geography all increased our ability to grow our business, expand our client acceptance, serve more customers in more ways.","In order to achieve consistent and profitable growth, our practice has been to add infrastructure and distribution capacity to support our growth ahead of the needs. In that regard, construction is proceeding according to schedule on our new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. [DC 10] will be one million square feet. It will be automated and highly efficient providing capacity and cost effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the northeast. We're on schedule for a third quarter 2013 completion.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin who will give more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance.","Kevin Wampler","Thanks Bob. As Bob mentioned, excluding the non-operating income from the Ollie\u2019s transaction, our diluted earnings per share increased 18.6% in the third quarter to $0.51. The increase resulted from our sales growth and expense control which resulted in a 40 basis point improvement in operating profit margin compared to the third quarter last year. ","Our gross profit margin was 34.9% during the third quarter compared with the 35.1% reported in the third quarter last year. Several factors contributed to this performance, freight costs increased driven by higher trucking rate and diesel fuel prices that averaged $0.23 per gallon above the same period last year. ","Our product mix continue to shipped in the third quarter as basic consumable products increased by 32 basis points as a percentage of sales. In addition, mark down expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales relative to the third quarter last year. These factors were partially offset by higher initial mark up across many categories. ","Occupancy and distribution expenses were flat as a percentage of sales reflecting the 1.6% comp store sales growth and the addition of 295 new stores compared with the same period last year. SG&A expenses were 24.2% of sales for the quarter which is a 60 basis point improvement from the third quarter last year. ","Operating expenses declined by about 45 basis points, this was driven by a realized gain of $3.8 million relating to the favorable resolution through a legal matter and reductions in legal fees, advertising expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities and debit and credit card fees as a percentage of sales.","Payroll related expenses declined by approximately 15 basis points due to lower incentive compensation expense compared with last year. We expect that credit card penetration will grow in the fourth quarter; we have just completed the rollout of MasterCard acceptance to an additional 3,500 stores. We now accept VISA and MasterCard in all of our stores chain wide and we also accept American Express and Discover in all of our stores in the United States. ","Operating income increased $19.3 million compared with the third quarter of last year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 10.7% at 40 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date to the third quarter operating margin is 10.8% an increase of 50 basis points from the same period of last year. ","The tax rate for the quarter was basically unchanged to 36.3% compared with the third quarter of last year at 36.4%. The tax rate was lowered than the tax rate anticipated in our guidance for the quarter due to favorable provision to return the reconciliation adjustments and the lowered tax rate on the Ollie's gain.","Cash and investments at the quarter end totaled $222.4 million versus $280.2 million at the end of third quarter 2011. During the third quarter, we invested $149.8 million for share repurchase and repurchased 3.3 million shares. During the first three quarters we invested $235.3 million for share repurchase and repurchased 5 million shares on the open market.","At quarter end, we had $965 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter was $230.0 million. Over the past four quarters, we have invested $535.3 million for share repurchase; we will update you on additional share repurchases if any at the end of the quarter in which they may occur.","Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 12.7% greater than it was at the same time last year. Selling square footage increased 7.1%, consolidated inventory per selling square foot increased by 5.2%, the increased reflect a higher amount of inventory in our distribution centers at the end of the third quarter and an increase in goods on the water. This is just for planned holiday and post Christmas sales and new store openings and it is consistent with our strategy to smooth the flow of inventory through our logistics network. Inventory turns increased in 2012 through three quarters and we expect this trend to continue for the full year, as it has for the past seven years. Capital expenditures were $96.6 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $75.5 million in the third quarter of last year. ","For the full year, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 325 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $70 million towards our new distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. The total capital investment anticipated for this facility is approximately $100 million. ","Depreciation and amortization was $43.6 million for the third quarter versus $41.1 million in the third quarter of last year. For the full year, we expect depreciation expense of $170 million to $173 million. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 includes several assumptions. First, Halloween shifted two days deeper in the fourth quarter this year from the first Monday of the quarter last year to the first Wednesday this year. We believe that this in fact shift approximately $5 million of sales from the third quarter into the fourth quarter compared to last year. ","Second, we've been asked about the impact of Hurricane Sandy on our fourth quarter. We are grateful to report that it appears the storm will not have a material impact on our fourth quarter results. Also as previously disclosed, due to the retail calendar 2012 will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. This is expected to add $120 million to $130 million of incremental sales and $0.07 to $0.08 earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year. ","Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.1% for the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 228.6 million shares for the fourth quarter and 231 million shares for the full year. As always, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. With this in mind for the fourth quarter of 2012, we are forecasting sales in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.26 billion based on a flat to a low-single digit comparable store sales increase and 7.2% square footage growth. ","Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.02, an increase of 21.3% to 27.5%. This fourth quarter guidance includes the impact of the extra week. For the full fiscal year of 2012, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.35 billion to $7.41 billion; based on a low to mid-single digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.2% square footage growth. ","Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.70, representing an increase of 31.8% to 34.3% over our record earnings per share of $2.01 in fiscal 2011. This includes the impact of the 53rd week. The full year guidance also includes $0.16 earnings per shares from the Ollie\u2019s sale in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the Ollie\u2019s transaction, we would expect full year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.49 to $2.54, representing an increase of 23.9% to 26.4% over last year. ","With that I will turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Kevin. In the face of a very challenging and uncertain environment Dollar Tree\u2019s traffic grew, our reach is expanding and we continue to deliver record profitability. Operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 10.7%, and I would like to point out that that\u2019s the highest this quarter operating margin in the history of our company. Earnings per share increased by 18.6% on top of a 19.2% increase last year. Our inventory is balanced and more productive than ever. Our turns increased again through the first three quarters of the year and we entered the fourth quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand.","Through the third quarter this year, we\u2019ve opened 298 new stores across the US and Canada, and the productivity of the new store flats has been performing ahead of last year. In addition, the company invested $235 million for share repurchase, buying back 5 million shares over the first three quarters, including 3.3 million shares for $115 million at the third quarter alone.","I believe that Dollar Tree has singularly positioned to do even better in the future. The customers are focused on our stores and our product. They are strategically located to serve middle America. They are bright, they are convenient and they are fun to shop. Our balance mix of high value consumer basics and our unique assortment of fund, compelling seasonally correct discretionary product positions us to be relevant to customers in all economic circumstances.","Dollar Tree has a solid and scalable infrastructure that we're expanding and leveraging for better inventory management, increasingly efficient supply chain, more productive stores and crisper execution overall. The deals we are at is gaining traction, both traffic and average ticket are growing. Dollar Tree Direct continues to broaden its reach, and we're building and expanding our Canadian business.","We've plenty of opportunities to grow our business, a vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen, while generating substantial free cash which we use for the long-term benefit of shareholders. We are having a great year, we\u2019ve transitioned quickly from Halloween and our stores are now set with our best merchandize value ever for Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday season. ","We are now ready for your questions so that we can accommodate as many callers as time permits. We ask that you limit your questions to two.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Partners. We\u2019ll take your question first.","","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Partners","With a little bit more benefit of hindsight, can you help us better understand that the causes of what\u2019s called that the slower comp growth that we saw towards the end of the second quarter and certainly in the third.","","Bob Sasser","","Sure, the Q3 had some sales pressures. It was a solid quarter, we are pleased that our sales were up 7.8%, our comp sales grew 1.6 and that was a result driven by traffic, our sales were within a range of guidance and it was an extremely profitable quarter. Our operating margin was the highest ever in Q3 at 10.7%. So it was really a strong quarter, net income up 12.2, EPS up 18.6 and again earnings at the high end of our guidance. ","So, as I sit here talk about pressures on our business, I am struck a little bit by the exceptional profitability of our quarter. Depression on sales were basically, I think you put them in three buckets that was number one, consumer anxiety from just continuation of a difficult macro environment with stubbornly high employment and continuing high gas prices and they keep rising and continued concerns about the top economy and the fiscal cliff, and all of this was magnified everyday as we went through the elections and that created anxiety and then certainly in the consumer that was one. ","Secondly, we had calendar shift of Halloween from Monday to Wednesday which moved two more Halloweens selling days into fourth quarter that was about a $5 million headwind and we saw that. And the third reason is the difficult comparisons. If you look at what we are up against, we are against the two years stack comp of 13.5%. As a comparison in Q2 this year, we were against the two years stand at 11.4%. And if you look back at the three years stack and the four years stack, you will find pretty much the same spread. ","So it was a pretty difficult comparison this year and third quarter, and especially difficult comparison in our consumable business which really as a percentage of totaled by a 170 basis points last year, and we were up against that this year. This year consumables grew 32 basis points on top of that.","We had a good quarter as I said, we are pleased with the profitability. We are now focused on fourth quarter, our stores are well prepared for the holiday sales. We are in stock, we are in business with the best values ever and we are looking forward to good fourth quarter.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Partners","And I guess, my confusion stems from effect that. gas prices seem to ease a little bit as the quarter went on and obviously the election wasn\u2019t until the end of the quarter like really after the quarter. So I am a little confused why sales was improved during the quarter, if these were the main reasons for the softness?","Bob Sasser","Well, those were all subjective; we all saw the same thing, gasoline prices overall rose throughout the quarter and I believe continue to rise, they are higher than they were this time last year, they were at -- we do well within difficult times. My point is, all the anxiety played out on TV 24\/7 with the election about the fiscal cliff, about the unemployment, about all the economic concerns, I believe put pressure on sales in the third quarter. Secondly, we had the calendar shift and lastly we were up against really tough comparisons in third quarter especially when you looked at our consumable business last year growing 170 basis points; its grown 200 basis points in two years, a 170 in last year, difficult comparison.","Operator","","We will go next to Matt Boss with JPMorgan.","Matt Boss - JPMorgan","So parching through the flat to up low single digit 4Q guidance and hurricane not really having a material impact, what are you seeing in regions that were not impacted by the storm, any improvement post the election as you talked about fiscal cliff worries, just kind of trying to parch through ex the storm what you've seen so far?","Bob Sasser","Well, Matt, obviously we don't give, we give guidance, but we don't then comment on the forward quarter, basically but beyond that. Obviously, I don't know that any of the macro environment has changed significantly since that point in time. Some of those things as unemployment, high gas prices and uncertainty around the fiscal cliff are still there. So I think I don't know that the environment has changed a whole lot. Obviously, we feel like we are ready for a good fourth quarter. We are, our stores are, teams are well prepared. We have the inventory that we think is well suited and right on the spot for the consumer. So our expectations are to go through the quarter and we believe it could be relatively good, while we are going some very tough compared a year ago when we were up 7.3% on a comp basis with pretty much perfect weather, so we all know that going into though.","Matt Boss - JPMorgan","And then on the gross margin line, can you just walk further through some of the puts and takes, any changes on the discretionary front and how did discretionary fair in the quarter and anything you are seeing from a competitive standpoint of note?","Bob Sasser","Really if you look at the discretionary versus consumables, both pieces of business were positive for the quarter, so I think that's very, very positive. So they both continue to comp positive which has been the case for many quarters in a row now. I think that as we go forward, we would expect that to continue. We are well positioned. We think that as we go forward that maybe there will, we've seen a slowdown I guess in a sense as far as the delta between growth in consumables if you look at the quarters this year Q1 I think we are up about 110 bps in consumables, Q2 is 40 and then Q3 30. So we've seen that moderate a little bit. But overall we feel good about where we've positioned ourselves.","We are a variety store first and foremost and that's what our heritage is and that's what we want to be known as and that is very important to us, so as we continue to go forward we think that's good. Gross profit otherwise, as we look at talk maybe to some of the pressures from Q3, obviously there was some freight pressure there and we really, as we\u2019ve talked in the prepared comments about trucking rates and the fact that if you look at the industry in general, since the economic downturn, there has been many trucking businesses go out, less competition obviously. If you keep up in that industry, there is a nation-wide shortage of truck drivers out there. So there is definitely some pressure there.","Fuel, 23 basis points, $0.23 up, I mean for the quarter. The metric there as we\u2019ve always said, as fuel, diesel fuels are a $1 higher for the full-year, it would be about $0.05 hit to us. So you can kind of back in to what that means to us. So I don't know that, I expect there still to be some pressure as we go forward in the Q4 in that area. We\u2019ve really seen it all year and I think we\u2019ll continue to see a little bit of it as we go through the fourth quarter as well.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. Two quick questions; one, now that we're past the election and I know that there was some noise or some pressures in swing states. Have you seen comps improve faster in those states or do you have that noise? And then secondly, given the moderation in consumables growth, are you still seeing the same productivity lift when you add freezers and coolers to stores as you have historically seen? Thank you.","Bob Sasser","Matt, we don\u2019t break it out by state or even by period our comp sales. We put that in our guidance; as Kevin described, he talked about the guidance going forward. Anecdotally, I will tell you that I think it's a good thing to get past the election and anything we can do to have more certainty in everybody\u2019s lives is a good thing. There is a lot concern out there still and I think we're still in a period of a little bit of uncertainty in consumer.","Having said that, we are prepared; we have all the things that we need. Our people have done a terrific job transitioning from third quarter and into fourth quarter preparing for the holiday; we have got the best assortments ever out there and when things are tight we are still going to shop and at Dollar Tree everything is at $1; we have things you need, things you want and we think we are going to get our fair share of the customer. I am particularly pleased with our merchandize assortment this year, a lot of its new, a lot of it is change, it\u2019s not the same old, same old and our customers I tell you they are going to be responding in great numbers to our stores and to our merchandize assortment for this fourth quarter. So we are excited about it yeah, so as we talk about all the headwind there, we always plan to get our piece of the business and I think we will do so again this year in the fourth quarter.","Kevin Wampler","And regards to your question as far as freezers and the lift as we add freezers and coolers to stores, we are continuing to see, as we have said historically a 5% to 10% lift across the store, so it\u2019s not just consumables that see a lift, it is discretionary and consumables across the board. So we are continuing to see that; we are now over 2,400 stores with freezers and coolers and we continue to rollout as we said this year 325 stores and we continue to look to grow that program going forward. We do believe obviously that its fast returning, little bit lower margin, but it does drive footsteps into our stores and we like the traffic it generates.","","Operator","We go next to Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","Thanks good morning. Just to kind of keep on this topic about the sales; if you look at the second quarter you guys were up 4.5% and it\u2019s my understanding, from the analyst data your business in the beginning of August really slowed sequentially; last I checked economy or gas prices or the fiscal cliff really didn\u2019t kind of play into kind of the equation then. So just wondering if you guys dug a little bit deeper as to just to try to understand why your business did slow in the quarter, just because you guys have been so consistent for multiple years here, it just seems very odd that your business was slow that much, that quickly?","Bob Sasser","Well Chuck, I think you just got to take a look at, the macro environment really hasn't improved. So it\u2019s stubborn, it continues and there is on certainty out there; prove it, I can't prove it. For you, I can just tell you what I see and what we hear and what we listen to our customers and what they say. Now as you look at the third quarter, it was a terrific quarter last year, we were up against a big two year comparison third quarter, it was the largest two years stack that when you look at the difference in the two years stack between second and third quarter it\u2019s about 200 basis point difference. So there is a big difference in the last year\u2019s performance that we were up against in third quarter.","And a lot of that was consumer products; we again grew our consumer goods at 170 basis points in third quarter of last year. This year we grew it again, but its 32 basis points on top of the 170. So those were the fact that did start off, every month was positive, every month it grew August, September improved over August, October over September so it grew through the quarter, all-and-all it was 1.6 comp at the end of the day.","So the three pressures that I listed are the three that we can identify and those are the things that we see and again, I will just point, the 1.6 comp delivered a lot of leverage still on fixed costs and it was an extremely profitable quarter for us.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","And then just for Kevin, just on the fourth quarter guidance (inaudible) to say dollar at the mid point, it looks like it implies about 70 basis points of operating margin expansion, I guess one is my math right and two can you kind of walk through the complexion of that, how much do you expect to get from gross margins versus SG&A?","Kevin Wampler","I mean I think your math is relatively correct. Obviously, you've got to remember we do have the extra week in the fourth quarter so we've got a $120 million to $130 million of sales where no additional fixed costs per se. Obviously, there are some variable costs that go with that. So that affects it and generally with the theme of the year I think what you would see is again the majority of the gains coming from SG&A, potentially gross profit being flat to maybe a little bit of upside. So I think that's, we continue to see the metrics kind of move in the same direction.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","","Not to sort of beat the dead horse to talk about fourth quarter sales, when I look at it, I looked at a three year factor or three year average because last year was strong in part because of weather but also because the prior year had been certainly well below trend and so I'm kind of a little bit surprised if I added say 1% on a three year basis would be a really significant deceleration. I guess the question that hasn't been asked is about competition where it was asked, that didn't quite get an answer, do you believe that Wal-Mart which has certainly been growing sales better than previously, do you think that's having an impact on your business?","Bob Sasser","Well, Meredith, I didn't hopefully, I'm answering the question about competition as best I can you know, we stay focus on what we do, we look at the competition, I can't tell you that I can relate one or the other of the competitors to a reason that we factor anything into our guidance going forward, anything different into our guidance going forward because we are so different than the other guys you know comparing Dollar Tree to a Wal-Mart is really not a good comparison as we do what we do, everything at Dollar with comp stores, we create terrific value for customers on things that they need everyday and we've been growing that business for several years as well as the discretionary business, it\u2019s a place to go to find fun and the exciting and new and seasonal and trend and everything is a (inaudible) as a fun shopping experience. So it\u2019s just really a lot different model and Wal-Mart is a lot different than the other guys with Dollar in their name. I'm sure they are all doing really well but I can't tell you that I see anything that they are doing that is having an effect on us adversely. We actually like being near most of them because of the traffic they bring into the shopping centers but we are just different and we stay focused on what we are doing.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Great and I have another question sort of unrelated, you did mention that I believe if I got it right that incentive comp was a bit of a help to expenses this quarter and I'm just wondering since your guidance has gone down for 4Q comp, does that mean that whatever they feel people need to produce has their expectation has gone down and so that if you hit a 1% then incentive comp would be there in the fourth quarter?","Kevin Wampler","Guidance obviously assumes the sales that we are expecting and within that is built the model of how we build up the incentive comp. So I don't think obviously if we significantly outperform the guidance with the sales bonus, potentially go up, yes but it goes up in concert. I mean that\u2019s the way it's built such that its paper performance realistically, the way we\u2019ve always looked at it. So I don\u2019t think it's got a significantly shift in the fourth quarter one way or the other. It's really built in accordingly.","Bob Sasser","And Meredith, I think incentives are still the same. And if they exceed their goals then they get paid more but we like that. If our stores exceed then we all exceed our goals. So if that all goes up in concert.","Operator","We will take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","So remember back in, way back in 1999 and 2000, Macon Brock used to say, don\u2019t invest in Dollar Tree if you want strong same-store sales. You know, the small story, highly efficient that kind of capacity obviously there is no price inflation benefits with the $1 format. And then over the seven years following the company rebuilt itself in to a chain of larger stores, since 2007, the company has been achieving the strongest same-store sales growth in its history, so a lot different scenario than what Macon talked about. Even today and we're getting sales productivity not quite back to where it was in 2000, measure per square foot but quite a bit closer. Do you think they were the tipping point, where those days, the 5%, 6% same-store sales gains just mathematically aren\u2019t possible given the big ramp that you achieved in the last four years and maybe business can be better than 2% that we should be thinking more, maybe that lower single-digit rate going forward?","Bob Sasser","Dan, going back to 1999, I remember I was there too and we did have small stores for the 4,000 to 6,000 square feet and they are pretty much opened up at what they were going to do and the comps were stubborn. As we expanded the size of our stores one of the things I used to like about perhaps still do is we expanded our open to sell which serve the customer better, it gave us the ability to serve, offer more products and more categories and serve more customers and brought more broad appeal and we have had that. I think your point about since 2007 through 2012 some of our highest comps is valid and I think what you are looking at is short-term versus long-term. ","I still believe what I told you back in 1999 about the largest store and where we would go and the opportunity to serve more customers and better serve our customers and increase our same-store sales and our productivity. I still believe in that, but we are going to go through swings from time-to-time, from year-to-year, from quarter-to-quarter and likely short-term you are going to have a quarter that\u2019s up against a really big quarter and really big, in this case five quarters and the comparisons are going to get a little difficult and what about it to deal with bad weather and by the way (inaudible) to get a little sentiment running the wrong way. I don\u2019t see that as long-term though. ","So yes we can still comp it at higher rates and we intend to comp at higher rates, I am clearly pleased with the 1.6 I know that sounds funny may be to when I say that, because always we are looking for more, but in this quarter a 1.6 comp and the way we convert it and leveraged that and converted that to operating margin. The highest operating margin ever in third quarter from a company that has high operating margins I think is and I am pretty proud of what I thought to have done with that. Can we do better? Absolutely. We can do a lot of things to continue to engage our customers we can sell more we can increase our productivity and all our stores it\u2019s going in the right direction. You hear me praising that. ","Directionally, we are going in the right way. We are not at the top, we are not where we are going to be, there are still things that we can do to drive productivity and our teams are working and focused and so look a little bit longer than one quarter and I still believe in the concept, I believe that we are more relevant today than we\u2019ve ever been to our customer. ","You know back in 1999, we clearly didn't have much that you needed; it was everything that you wanted for the most parts small stores. Now with our mix, when times are tough, we got things to sell in tough times and you can see that growth in our consumer products from that. One-time aren\u2019t so tough, we have discretionary product. I talk about like customers are having jingle in their pockets because I really want to sell the full mix and that's what we strive to do it Dollar Tree, its not just one or the other selling the mix and selling the shopping experience and I still believe that when everything is in dollar in a store and that makes us different and our customers love it, and they react to it and they are going to go into for many years, go ahead.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","I just want to add follow-up also on (inaudible) question about competition and expand the competitive side to include Family Dollar and Dollar General. It does appear that Dollar Tree\u2019s momentum in consumables began to slow about the same time that Family Dollar began to make bigger investments in consumable products whether it\u2019s a Pepsi product or [Mclean] products, and also it appears that maybe the business begin to decelerate after quotes, you started downsizing the Coke bottles at Dollar Tree from 20 ounces to 14 ounces. I know there is a lot of weak (inaudible) in that part of the business based on pricing and value. Maybe you can talk about on those two issues?","Bob Sasser","","I know it may sound like that and it look like that but stacks are just they just don't support. As we look at our stores that are in the competitor\u2019s areas and we see no difference, we see nothing from what they are doing that is affecting our stores on the store-by-store or market-by-market basis. ","Like I said, they are good retailers, I have great respect for all of them but we are different, its just not, we are not the same, we are not a Coke Pepsi predominantly driven name brand predominantly driven assortment and when we do have name brands, we are usually a little different and I think our value on our front end, we only sell the Coke products at the front end for the most part, from time-to-time we will have to somewhere else but its always impulse, its always out of the cooler, mostly out of the cooler, you need one to drink, you pull it out, it\u2019s a great value for a buck. By the way you can buy the Pepsi and it\u2019s a bigger bottle than the Coke product for a buck. That's a position that Coke has chosen to take. ","And so we are just like everybody else. We are out there whatever size they are willing to sell for that price. So I can't tell you that, I will tell you that there is no data that supports the fact that the competition is taking away our consumer products business. It is more us, it is more we started from zero to whatever we have now in the last several years and now we are starting to year-over-year run up against those big, big numbers and we can continue to grow but we intend to grow the whole mix, not just one side or the other and as you will go into our stores hopefully this Christmas you'll go into a stores, take a look and when you walk in what you are going to see is Christmas, and you are going to see fun and you are going to see toys and you are going to see all the things to decorate you house, and wrap your boxes and give you presents and stock and stuffers and all of those kinds of things because that is what we think adds excitement merchandize energy, ever changing mix of product to what makes us a difference than the rest of the folks in our sector. ","So that's the facts we are in control of our destiny, we are going to have times where the comps are more and times when the comps are less and year-over-year-over-year you know there are going to be times when you have a little different set of circumstances after five years of progressively increasing comps. Look at the long term though, and I don't mean long term next century, I'm talking about just look at the long term future of our company, we are in the best position, we've got the most growth, we've got the most tools to grow, we have Dollar Tree, we have Deal$, we have Dollar Tree Canada, we have Dollar Tree Direct. We have the infrastructure to support that growth. We know how to run it, and I'm really pleased about where we are. It\u2019s like playing golf I tell folks if I can take my drive, instead of driving if I can place my ball out in the fair way where I wanted, this is where I want to point it. We are exactly where we need to be in regard to relevance to our customer and that's the answer.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)  We will go next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","","Just a follow-up on some of these other questions surrounding the guidance. Just to be clear, you\u2019ve had an acceleration in each month in the quarter. So are you running currently at the high end of the range, and if so, is it really just the conservatism associated with the tougher comparison that's driving the flat to low-single digit.","Bob Sasser","Yeah, Steven, again we don't give any information out about you know the forward quarter. Obviously everything we know today is baked into our guidance as we've given it to you and that's really where we are at. I don't know that we believe that there's conservatism in our guidance; we try to put it together with what the best facts that we have in front of us at that point in time and we try to be as realistic as possible and put the best numbers forward that we can. So that's kind of how we look at it and that's really all we can speak to you at this point.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Great and then as a follow-up to that would just be the leverage point seems to have come down with the comp and it definitely surprised the upside. If the comp was to reaccelerate, how does that change the dynamic of the leverage point and what would actually flow through and what would you think about maybe reinvesting the business?","Bob Sasser","Well, obviously, the better the comp, the more leverage we\u2019ve traditionally seen; there is no doubt about that. We continue to work very hard in every aspect of our business to become more efficient to find ways to improve processes, buy things better from a non-merchandize point of view. All those things we work hard on every day, and obviously we believe there is always continue to room to improve there. ","I think as we think about investing in our business, obviously the best thing investing is another Dollar Tree stores. We\u2019ve said for a long time; that the return on another Dollar Tree store is the best thing we can do, and we look to continue to grow our business; we're investing in our infrastructure with a new distribution center, $100 million project. So not a small project and we will continue to look at those type of things. We continue to be a buyer of our stock in Q3 with a $149 million of stock repurchase in Q3. So those are ways we look at continuing to invest and our business, and as we continue to create strong quality earnings, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll look to do.","Operator","We will take our next question from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","My question is on relocation. Can you talk about the performance of your relocations more recently versus last few years? Are you moving, starting to further down the opportunity curve there, and what does the quality of the pipeline look like over the next few years?","Bob Sasser","Yeah we are very strategic in our relocations now. We rarely close a store and we are always looking though we do usually five year leases with three five year terms something like that, sometimes longer if we know the market we are better. But the idea being that as the market changes we can move with the markets.","Back in the earlier days as we were transitioning from the small store to the large store, relocation was strategic for the market, but it was also an increase usually of the store size. Today our relocations are typically to stores strictly for strategic reasons may be the anchor and the center moved may be the population has changed, maybe we are just run out of term and we need to move may be the landlord is not going to scrape the center and something like that. ","But the size of the store moving from is about the same as the size of the store that we are building. So there is not much of a difference and that is strictly a relocation based on strategy based on where we want to be in the market and how many stores and we talk about planning the market. It\u2019s not just one store it\u2019s the entire market that we are looking at. ","So (inaudible) asked the question I would say that the pipeline we start looking at opportunities to relocate several years before the lease term expires, and we are always out there looking at the market and moving things around to be optimal. I would say that most of the time we relocate strategically, we are finding the space to move to, we are finding the right kinds of product and again we have the ability to take what\u2019s there as is and turn it into a nice Dollar Tree store. ","Sometimes we can work with those developer, sometimes not as much since 2008, but little more now then has been to build the right Dollar Tree store for us. So the relocations are generally there and the idea of planning out the market is moving them around is typically the reasons we do it now, not to get to a bigger store as much.","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse","The question I am trying to ask has the sales lift from relocations changed it all over, let's call for last for two, three, four quarters and would you expect the sales lift over the next couple of years to be similar to what it\u2019s been?","Bob Sasser","Sales was about the same as it was last year from a relo, and again we are relo in same size stores typically. A 10000 square foot stores, to the 10000 square foot store. So there is not a benefit for more square footage as it was in early days moving from 5 to 10. But we are still last year this year it was like pretty much the same sales lift.","Operator","And we will now take our last question from Dan Binder from Jefferies and Company.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","I had a couple of questions. First in your comments about the sequential improvements from August to October, I am just curious if you could drill down a little bit. What was the comp gap across it was like the worst and best performing month in the quarter. And then also as you have seen that the comp slow a little bit here. Do you think that you are inclined to do more types of promotion like two for one kind of things to try and get the business reaccelerate a little bit?","Bob Sasser","I can't tell you the comp gap for month and month, we just don't report that, but it\u2019s really more. August last year was a bigger quarter than bigger period in September of course last year. So we were up against a bigger number in August. As we enter the quarter we are comp positive every period and it rose throughout the quarter. But it was more in relation to what we did last year by period than it was anything else to get to the 1.6. ","And no we are not going to do two-for-ones. Everything\u2019s at a dollar at Dollar Tree and we put the most value in it we can put for a dollar and it\u2019s worth more than a dollar. So it\u2019s not the value of our product as we see these things, and we are not planning any dramatic promotions and I would point to one more time that we had the highest operating margins in the third quarter we've ever had in the third quarter. ","So our goal is to make money, our goal is to drive sales, drive productivity, leverage the fixed costs, leverage our infrastructure and make money for our shareholders and we are going to do that the best way. Sales is not something that we do. Clearance is the only thing we do, after Christmas we will sell some things too for a dollar but Christmas items. But no we don't plan any price promotions, we are already at price promotion; the whole store at 10,000 square feet [supplies].","Dan Binder - Jefferies","My other question was regarding store growth versus comp levels. When you are comping solid mid single 7% type square footage growth, it makes a lot of sense. One data point isn't a trend obviously, but if we look out over the next call it two to three quarters and you are more convalescent with your comps versus mid single, do you think you need to rethink square footage growth and how that plays into the model.","Bob Sasser","No, I don't think so. Our best use of a dollar invested is to build a new Dollar Tree store and the returns are terrific and our goal is to keep making them even better, more productive and we are having success in that. The new stores are opening up in a higher historically higher rate, productivity, sales per square foot are up and we think we can drive that higher. ","So our returns should be going up and we are happy with continuing to grow and open more stores. The number of stores that we are opening are the number of stores that we think we can open profitability with the infrastructure that we felt, with the people and the store teams that we have and that we can develop profitably. ","So we are subject, we have plenty of room for growth. You know we can run we think 7000 Dollar Tree stores, we've got a lot of room to go towards getting that number, and our goal is to continue growing pretty much at this rate. We haven't announced what next year\u2019s rate is, but I'm still bullish on Dollar Tree. So we still have the same idea. We are going to grow what we think we can do based on our ability to do it profitably, not get ahead of ourselves.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Guiler","Thank you, Keith. Good morning and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015. Participating on today's call will be our CEO, Bob Sasser; CFO, Kevin Wampler; and Family Dollar's President and Chief Operating Officer, Gary Philbin.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree's Chief Executive Officer.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Randy, good morning, everyone. This morning we announced results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2015.","Total sales for the quarter increased to $5.37 billion and same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7%. Total sales for fiscal 2015 which included nearly 7 months of Family Dollar sales were $15.5 billion. Net income for the quarter was $229 million and adjusted net income was $239.4 million near the high end of our range of guidance. EPS was $0.97 and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.01. ","I'm extremely pleased with our company's accomplishments in the fourth quarter. Sales were solid and the midpoint of our range of guidance. SG&A expenses were leveraged and well managed. Our Dollar Tree segment continues to deliver sector leading operating margins and earnings were very near the top of our guidance.","Our customer base is large and it's growing and we continue to meet our milestones and remain on schedule with our integration of Family Dollar. We have truly an incredible opportunity ahead of us as a combined organization and a strategic rationale for the combination continues to be as compelling as ever. In the early stages of integration, there have been no surprises that diminish our vision and plans for value creation. In fact as we improve retail operations, there is increased enthusiasm for the opportunity to grow and to serve more customers in more ways as a combined company.","We have confidence in our disciplined approach to continue improving the customer experience at Family Dollar and in our ability to capture synergies for the combined organization. With the focus on managing our business in real-time, our eyes are on the horizon as we develop the foundation for a larger, stronger and more diversified business that will generate cash and build shareholder value for years to come. ","Only two quarters into the integration our teams are aligned strategically and collaborating effectively to deliver solid results. Accomplishments in the fourth quarter were numerous including another solid quarter for our Dollar Tree banner. As expected Dollar Tree delivered a low single-digit same-store sales increase. ","Same-store sales on a constant currency base increased 1.7% and that was on top of a strong 5.6% increase on the fourth quarter a year ago. Same-store sales increased as a result of growth in both basic consumables and discretionary products, and sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket. Top performing categories include party supplies, beauty and eyewear, snacks and beverage, and candy and food. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Northeast and Midwest.","I'm extremely pleased with the consistent growth and strength of Dollar Tree business. This was the 32nd consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales. That's 32 straight quarters, eight straight years of comp growth, and everything is still a dollar. Cycling comps are 5.6% last year and through a difficulty in consumer environment, fourth quarter results again validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers are shopping with us more often and we're attracting new customers every day. And when the customers who are in the stores are buying more, both traffic and average ticket increase for the quarter. ","Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve a very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our customer, our existing customers better while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day. ","Our merchant teams do a tremendous job sourcing products that exceed customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that meets our margin requirements. Merchandise margin increased in the fourth quarter. Our store teams are focused on providing a clean, full, fun and friendly shopping experience. Merchandise values at Dollar Tree are better than ever.","As we enter fourth quarter, store presentations boldly communicated a message to our customers that Dollar Tree was the go-to store for basics and your holiday needs. In early November we focused on first of the month basic consumables and Thanksgiving related foods like chicken broth and vegetables and soups. We placed emphasis on taking care of customer-need related to holiday meals with baking basics, mixing bowls, foil pans, turkey basters and food storage containers. And we addressed the customers need related to holiday entertaining with catering trays, bowls and servers.","Our Home for the Holidays promotion featured dinnerware, glassware, table linens and snack foods like cookies and mints and party nuts, and everything was just $1. Immediately following Thanksgiving, our stores made a swift transition to Christmas holiday decorations, toy land and great gift ideas, and the merchant at stores continue to build on our last ten days strategy by bringing all of the last minute categories together and remerchandising the front of the store with a purpose.","Our goal is to be the gift supply headquarters for items like holiday tents, gift bags, tissue, wrapping paper, scissors and tape. Our customers understand that if you need to wrap it, bag it, box it or tag it, Dollar Tree is the store for you. If you're buying your wrapping supplies anywhere else, you're paying too much. In addition to our seasonal energy, customers continue to look at Dollar Tree for their basic needs. Throughout the quarter our stores continued to highlight and promote our million dollar brands. These brands that they know and trust like Pringles, Nabisco, Scotties, Crest Toothpaste and many more. ","Looking forward, the Dollar Tree segment is positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business through opening more stores and increasing the productivity of all of our stores.","In the fourth quarter we opened a total of 63 new Dollar Tree stores. We relocated or expanded 11 Dollar Tree stores. We rebannered 58 Family Dollar stores, two Dollar Tree stores and we rebannered 52 Deal stores to Dollar Tree stores, for a total of 184 Dollar Tree projects during the fourth quarter. Total Dollar Tree banner square footage increased 10.3% compared to the prior year, and we ended the fiscal year with a total of 5,954 Dollar Tree stores across North America, an increase of 587 stores this year.","In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve the productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive to business initiatives include category expansions. Customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments in pet supplies, hardware, health care, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products.","We're driving the business with a focus on seasonal relevance. Our store fronts change with the seasons. We want our customers to know what season it is when they come in the front door. At Dollar Tree we want to own the seasons at the dollar price point. We're driving the business by creating merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt throughout the store. At Dollar Tree you always find an unexpected value. And we're driving the business by being first of the month ready. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customer are shopping for basic needs.","We're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In fourth quarter we installed freezers and coolers in 142 additional Dollar Tree stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated products in 4,287 stores and growing. Our plan is to roll out freezers and coolers to 400 additional stores in 2016. We are on-schedule with our planned conversions of our Deal store locations. As we announced in October, we plan to dedicate our full energy and resources to our two primary banners; Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. As planned the rebannering of our 222 Deal stores commenced in January and we are on track to complete this project on-schedule.","We continue to support planned growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. Construction on our newest D.C. and Cherokee County South Carolina is on-schedule and on budget. This $1.5 million -- excuse me, 1.5 million square foot automated facility will provide capacity and increased efficiency to support continued profitable stores growth in the southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We plan to begin shipping product from this new facility in July. To support continued growth in western markets, we are expanding our stock in California distribution center from 525,000 to 820,000 square feet, an increase of 55%. This project is also scheduled to be completed by mid-year.","Turning to the Family Dollar banner we continued to make meaningful progress on the Family Dollar integration. In fourth quarter, Family Dollar stores completed the clearance of non-go forward product at the beginning of November and quickly moved to the impact of the holiday merchandise set. End-caps were reclaimed for the holiday period and for the January promotional resets. Systems on hand are cleaner and our service levels continued to improve. Just over two quarters in, the stores are cleaner, the shelves are better stocked. We cleaned up old inventory and the end-caps are more compelling and relevant. The feedback we're receiving has been positive. Our customer satisfaction scores has improved validating that the customers are taking notice.","Regarding sales for the quarter the Family Dollar banner delivered a low single digit positive comp store sales increase. Same-Store sales increased as a result in the growth of both traffic and average ticket, with traffic leading the way. Same-Store sales increased in both discretionary and consumables with slightly higher sales growth in consumables. Sales were positive each month with the strongest sales increases in December. Geographically, comparable store sales at Family Dollar were strongest in the west and mid-Atlantic. For the fourth quarter we opened a total 65 new Family Dollar stores and we relocated or expanded 42 Family Dollar for a total of 107 projects. Additionally, during the quarter we rebannered 58 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree. We completed the required divesture of 325 stores to sycamore partners at the beginning of the fourth quarter.","We ended the fiscal year with 7,897 Family Dollar stores and a total Family Dollar and Dollar Tree combined store count of 13,851 stores across North America. Just like Dollar Tree our primary areas of focus for Family Dollar stores are on the customer, the shopping experience and the value equation. Merchants and stores are working hard to be first of the month ready and weekend ready. We are paying special attention to opening price points, national brand pricing, the role of private label products while rationalizing queues for increased productivity and a focus on basic end-stock levels. Additionally, we are in the process of rolling out our smart ways to save program. The value elements of smart ways to save are a combination of everyday low price elements and items, strategically planned sales and price-drop promotions, incredible $1 value items and an enhanced assortment of named brands, private label name brand equivalents and value brands.","In order to earn back our Family Dollar customer's confidence and frequency of visit, we are committed to improving the customer experience. There is a keen focus on table stakes including store standards and conditions. We want them to be bright, clean and free of clutter. The customer experience will in stock stores grow easily shop trusted value, focus on the merchandise relevance. We have to add what our customer's need and want. And we are focused on customer engagements, friendly and informed associates. By identifying and establishing appropriate retailing disciplines and benchmarks, customers are already seeing cleaner aisles with less clutter.","I am very pleased to report that recent results from our customer satisfaction surveys are showing meaningful improvement in fourth quarter versus prior year customer scores and each of our four primary survey categories which are store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. Continued improvements in each of these matrix will contribute to Family Dollar becoming the neighborhood store of choice for our customers shopping trips. We will manage investments and table stakes with the same disciplined approach that we have used at Dollar Tree for many years. Identifying and paying special attention to the customer facing matrix with a focus on return on investment and productivity enhancement while reducing cost leveraging our shared services and back office functions and re-investing some of these savings in the customer. As we have done at Dollar Tree we will test and learn and we will invest prescriptively while measuring return on our investments.","As always, our P&L will continue to be managed line-by-line, quarter-by-quarter with a keen eye on ROI, our quarterly guidance will reflect our expectations. We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run-rate synergies by the end of the third full year post closing. And as previously disclosed these synergies will be achieved with one time cost of $300 million. As a reminder, we have identified synergies in four primary areas. First of all, sourcing and procurement; second, rebanner program for optimizing store formats; third, distribution and logistics and fourth, overhead and corporate SG&A.","We still have a lot of work ahead of us but at this stage we are clearly on track to achieve our first twelve months milestone of at least $75 million in run-rate synergies. Plans and processes to capture sourcing and procurement synergies are well under way. Our exact item match initiative to provide the lowest cost on identical items across both banners is complete with expected results, no surprises. The review of similar match items continues with outstanding results, there is more to come here. We are achieving planned savings from harmonizing our payment terms, auction RFPs in a formal bid process are well under way on expense items. Our savings continue to grow and meet expectations.","During the fourth quarter, we rebannered an additional 58 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree bringing our total of converted stores for fiscal 2015 to 205 stores. This slightly exceeded our target of 200 conversions for the year. The preliminary results are meeting expectations and feedback from customers has been positive. With plans to convert an additional 100 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Trees in 2016 and our analysis will continue. Ultimately, our strategy is to have the right banner in the best location to serve our customers. We are finalizing the supply chain roadmap and we will soon be piloting our first co-bannered distribution center. With the cross-organizational functional team we are integrating our warehouse management systems and we are making plans to rationalize the fleet of combined DCs, analyzing space needs by banner and determining our ability and the merits of shipping both banners out of all facilities. This is a very large project with significant opportunity for long-term synergies.","Our first pilot facility in St. Georges, Utah, is planned to be operational before the third quarter. We continue to make progress on reducing cost through our shared services model. We are combining back office functions to support both banners through our shared services organization. Overtime, these shared services will include human resources, finance, information technology, supply chain and logistics, indirect sourcing and procurement, real estate and construction, legal, strategic planning and internal audit. Our goal is to provide consistent, efficient support of our business initiatives across the combined organization through a more cost effective approach. We are less than a year into the integration and we have made tremendous progress. We still have a great deal of work ahead of us. The timing of some would be dependent on our IT integration, our strategy is not to touch everything at once, but to prioritize our areas of focus, to get it right the first time and the build the overall business for the long term. It's a process. We are employing a well-planned, thoughtful, low risk strategic approach that will benefit our long term shareholders.","Now I turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our fourth quarter financial performance and our initial outlook for 2016.","Kevin Wampler","Thanks, Bob and good morning. As a result of the acquisition year-over-year comparisons are difficult however, we have included tables with our press releases which we believe will help be helpful in better understanding the components of our business.","Total sales for the fourth quarter grew 117% to $5.37 billion which includes over second full quarter of Family Dollar sales. This was at the midpoint of the sales guidance range of $5.32 billion dollars to $5.42 billion. Dollar Tree segment sales increased 8.6% to $2.69 billion while Family Dollar segment sales decreased 2.7% to $2.68 billion. Year-over-year sales comparisons for Family Dollar were impacted by 205 rebannered stores and 325 divested stores. ","Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.7% versus a very strong 5.6% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase was driven by both traffic and ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations same-store sales grew 1.3%. All of the recently acquired Family Dollar stores and newly rebannered Family Dollar and Deal stores are considered new stores and are excluded from our same-store sales calculation.","Gross profit for the combined organization increased by $734.5 million or 80% to $1.65 billion for the fourth quarter 2015 compared with the prior year's quarter. Majority of the dollar increase was driven by Family Dollar's gross profit of $673.7 million. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 36.4% during the fourth quarter compared with 37.1% in the prior year's fourth quarter. Approximately, one-half of the 70 basis point decline as the percent of sales was related to actual accrued markdowns associated with the planned conversion of all Deal stores locations. Other factors contributing to the year-over-year decline in gross margin rate was occupancy cost, higher distribution cost and shrink partially offset by improved merchandise cost. ","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 25.2% during the fourth quarter compared with 25.1% in comparable period prior year period. Including the $15.9 million of indoor step-up amortization, gross profit margin was 25.9% for the quarter, the improvement of 80 basis points on a comparable basis driven by improved mark on and lower markdowns partially offset by higher occupancy costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter for the combined organization increased 121% to $1.18 billion from $534.5 million in last year's fourth quarter. The majority of the $648.4 million increase related to $608.4 million of Family Dollar expense. Q4 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percent of sales was 21.4%, a 20 basis points to sales improvement compared to the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $3.3 million of acquisition and integration related cost while the prior year included $6.7 million of acquisition related cost. Excluding these costs, adjusted SG&A improved to 21.2% for Q4 compared to 21.3% for the prior year's quarter. This ten basis point improvement was driven primarily by payroll related cost including retirement plan contributions and store bonuses and was partially offset by higher operating and corporate expenses including legal fees and cost associated with the Deal store conversion.","SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percent sales was 22.7% compared to 20.6% in the prior year's quarter. The current year includes $19.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization, $16 million in additional depreciation for useful life and fixed asset revaluation, $8.9 million of severance costs and integration costs. The prior year's comparable period includes $10.8 million of acquisition related cost. Excluding these costs, SG&A increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales to 20.9% from 20.2% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation, repairs, professional fees and divested share related costs.","Adjusted operating income and excluding acquisition and integration related cost for the Dollar Tree segment increased $17.4 million to $407 million, as a percent of sales adjusted operating income decreased 50 basis points to 15.2% compared to 15.8% of sales in the prior year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $1.9 million to $134.0 million. Year-over-year comparison was impacted by 205 rebannered stores and the divestiture of 325 Family Dollar stores. As a percent of sales adjusted operating income increased 10 basis points to 5% compared to 4.9% of sales in the prior year's comparable period.","Non-operating expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $117.2 million and were comprised primarily of net interest expense of $114.9 million in the quarter which included an acceleration of $19 million in non-cash deferred financing cost associated with our pre-payment of long term debt of $1 billion in January. ","For the fourth quarter, the company had net income of $229 million and $0.97 per diluted share. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as detailed in the press release tables were $239.4 million and $1.01 per diluted share. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35% compared to 36.4% in the prior year's quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in the work averaging tax credits or relation to the income for the fourth quarter and a decrease in state tax expense. ","Looking at the balance sheet, combined cash and cash equivalents at yearend totaled $736.1 million compared to $864.1 million at the end of Q4, and as noted we did make a $1 billion debt pre-payment in late January. Our standing long term debt is now approximately $7.5 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was 18.9% greater than at the same time last year while selling square footage increased 10.4%. ","Inventory for selling square foot increased 7.7%. The primary contributors to the year-over-year increase in inventory levels relate to the West Coast port disruptions experienced a year ago and earlier Eastern 2016 and an earlier Chinese New Year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support schedule the new store openings and our sales initiatives for the first quarter. For the Family Dollar segment, end of year inventory on a selling square foot basis increased 0.6% compared to the prior year. We are pleased with the progress were seeing on in stock levels of key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the first quarter.","Capital expenditures were $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $71.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For fiscal 2016 we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $650 million to $670 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores including 350 new Dollar Tree stores and 200 new Family Dollar stores. The remodel, relocation or expansion of approximately 200 stores, rebannering of approximately 100 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores, and the rebanner of the 158 remaining Deal stores for a total of more than 1,000 store projects in 2016.","In addition, we'll add frozen and refrigerate capability for approximately 400 Dollar Tree stores. We have IT system enhancements and integration projects. The completion of our new Cherokee County South Carolina's distribution center and the completion of our stock in California distribution center expansion.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $174.9 million for the fourth quarter. This includes purchase accounting related cost of $19.3 million for favorable lease rights amortization and $15 million in depreciation for useful life and asset revaluation. Depreciation expense was $54.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. ","For fiscal 2016 we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $630 million to $640 million. This range includes increases over the historical run rate of depreciation and amortization expense for Family Dollar for two items which were included in our guidance. First, it includes $8 million for Q1 and $5 million for Q2 depreciation above the historical run rate for Family Dollar as a result of harmonizing the depreciable-wise accounting policies of the two companies, and the increase in the value of the assets based on the purchase price allocation. Secondly, includes $18.7 million for Q1 and $74 million for fiscal 2016 for the amortization of favorable lease rights for the purchase accounting valuation of Family Dollar leases.","Turning to sales and earnings per share guidance. For modeling purposes, our initial outlook for 2016 includes the following assumptions. As a reminder, at the beginning of Q4 2015, we divested 325 Family Dollar stores that represented approximately $500 million in annual sale and $45.5 million in operating income. Our same-store sales calculations exclude Family Dollar stores and excludes stores that are rebannered. These stores will be included in our same-store sales calculations when they have been opened as a Dollar Tree for 15 months.","We will continue to experience a higher to normal degree of cannibalization to Dollar Tree comps as part of our rebanner efforts. This cannibalization expectation was planned and factored into both our rebannered strategy and analysis, and our outlook for same-store sales. We will continue our initiatives to rebanner stores. First focusing on rebannering all Deal stores and then we plan to convert an additional 100 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Trees. Each will be one week earlier than the prior year. This represents an estimated $10 million head wind of sales. Inventory step up amortization will be approximately $6 million in Q1 and $2 million in Q2.","We are budgeting lower diesel fuel cost than a year ago with the first half providing the most benefits. Interest expense will be approximately $90 million per quarter in 2016. And we do not anticipate any share re-purchases in 2016. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations so we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes the tax rate of 36.6% for the first quarter and 36.8% for fiscal 2016. Weighted average diluted share counts are soon to be 236.4 million shares for Q1 and for the full year.","For first quarter we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.05 billion to $5.12 billion and diluted range per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $0.75 to $0.83. These estimates are based on a low single digit same-stores sales increase and year-over-year per footage growth of a 132%. Sales & earnings per share outlook for the full fiscal year we are forecasting total sales to range from $20.76 billion to $21.11 billion and diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis in the range of $3.35 to $3.65. These estimates are based on a low single digit same-store sales increase and 4% sales footage growth.","I will now turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Kevin. I want to close the strategic rationale for the Family Dollar acquisition is as compelling as ever. This is an extremely large and complex transaction involving more than 13,000 retail store locations and 23 distribution centers. While we are still in the early stages of the integration process, I am very pleased with the process and our progress. Gary Philbin and the leadership team at Family Dollar are working the plan effectively and efficiently.","We continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver at least $300 million in annual run-rate synergies by the end of year three, I believe we can exceed these expectations. These synergies will be achieved for a combination of lower end cost, both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, logistics and overhead. I am extremely proud of our combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree teams. They have accomplished extraordinary feats in very short time. But this is just the beginning. There is much more to do and I will tell you as always we will employ disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. We are confident in placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvement in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.","I will close the prepared remarks by saying that the Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible, and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers, while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history. For 3 consecutive quarters Dollar Tree banner has delivered positive same-store sales increases through good times and difficult times and all retail cycles consumers are looking for value, no matter what the state of the economy. While on price point remains a dollar, our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. With the addition of Family Dollar, we are larger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to grow in more markets while serving more customers with exactly what they are looking for, great value, in every store, every day. Our future has never been brighter.","Operator, we are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Michael Lasser","Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. It's on a core Dollar Tree business. It's that they were caught in a row where their comps were below 3%, are you seeing any indication that your running into some limitations of your merchandise flexibility with the single price point model and along those lines what are you anticipating on the merchandising side to see the benefit given in what some of the Asian currencies have done and given how much that you should source your product overseas and then have a big follow-up. Thanks.","KevinWampler","Michael, thanks for the question. To the first part of the question, we are not limited by the merchandise assortment or the price point. We have more assortment than ever, our values are better than ever, our stores are larger. There is more merchandise and more assortment than we ever had, so there is no limitation to that. If you look at fourth quarter largely, we're up against a very big fourth quarter last year, 5.6% comp in the year before. So basically, in sort of a tough economy, we are up against a fairly difficult comparison, 5.6% and I think that 1.7% in comp is admirable considering the what we faced with that comp last year.","As to China, our sourcing continues to be strong and vibrant, we still import a lot of product. About 20% of our business is in product that we import and that continues. Our pricing of China has been very positive. We have been able to not only improve values in our product by taking a lower cost on the, turning that into more value for the customer but also we have been able to reduce cost on the things we buy every quarter, every year that we keep in our stores all the time, so the basics we have been able to reduce cost on that, especially on the last trip so, you had a follow-up question?","Michael Lasser","Yes, my other question was on the guidance for the year. What have you assumed on wage increases, additional investments in the stores and the cost to harvest the synergies within your outlook for [indiscernible]. Thanks so much.","KevinWampler","So Michael, as we work to put our guidance together for the full year obviously, take all of the things into consideration. Obviously from a wage perspective, there are continued to be certain dates in the US as well as providences in Canada continue to raise their individual minimum wages and obviously we put those into the mix as we look at our business, no difference in any other year and to the point, we have historically said we are competitive in the markets we are in and that's important because you have to be to, to get good employees at the end of the day. So I don't think that's really changed within the guidance.","As you look at the synergies and you look at the cost to achieve, obviously we have an expectation that we will achieve synergies this year. There are synergies baked in, we have specifically said the dollars and part of that is the timing a little bit hard to nail specifically down with we are well on our way to meeting or beating the first year run-rate of $75 million of synergies so I think we have baked things in accordingly, but still a lot of work to be done to make that happen but we feel good about where we are at today. ","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you so much and good luck with the year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital.","ScotCiccarelli","Good morning, guys.","KevinWampler","Good morning.","ScotCiccarelli","The first question is, is there an estimate that you guys have in terms of the impact of cannibalization in the quarter? Obviously, Kevin you made that reference that means you talked about last quarter as well?","KevinWampler","Yes, I think as we look at it, obviously analyze it, we analyze it going into it as we said within the prepared remarks, and that the expectation was there that there was going to be some effect and it was little less than half a percent but I think it is exactly where we expected it to be. So in some ways, that was all related to rebannering, so in some ways you can say that without that we would have been above a two, but I think we all know that for the improvement of the business we are doing the right things with these rebannering. They are going to be great stores, great opportunity to put the best store in the best location for our customers and put our best foot forward and it will show in the bottom line as we go forward, so I think that's the way we think about it.","ScotCiccarelli","Okay. That's helpful and then, is there a synergy number that we can kind of think about for the quarter that's just completed or is the bulk of that $75 million going to happen in the first half of 2016, just given the timing issues that you already mentioned?","KevinWampler","Yes, I think as we think about it there is probably more to the back app a little bit. There is a little bit within the first quarter but we are not really going to speak to a specific number at this point in time but it is built into our guidance. ","ScotCiccarelli","And was there anything that you were able to capture in the fourth quarter that you can outline?","KevinWampler","Yes, I think obviously there was a little bit in the fourth quarter that relates to the exact match process that Bob spoke to in his comments. The merchants worked hard on that and there was some of that that did go into effect in a sense. What you got to remember is you already got merchandise on hand basically at the prior price so it takes a while to work to the system to see the benefit, it's a kind of way you need to think about that.","ScotCiccarelli","In other words, just prepared a final clarification here. The bulk in the synergies for first year, are we going to start to see accelerate in 2Q of '16","Bob Sasser","I think we have to start to definitely see some things hitting that will make a difference.","ScotCiccarelli","Got it. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Well just a follow up on the guidance, can you just provide a little more color on how you think about the profitability by segment, maybe excluding the synergies which -- whatever the high level puts tick to think about ours?","Bob Sasser","At this point we're going to give guidance as a combined company. I think if you look at it, at the midpoint of our guidance, our operating margin for Q1 basically gives about a mid-7% number. If you look after the full year, you're at the high 7% approaching 8%. We're going to give guidance as a combined company. We'll give you color at the end of each quarter. But that's how we're going to factor that as we go forward.","Stephen Grambling","Okay, fair enough. And then is there any detail you can provide on what you're seeing from these rebannerings as relates to the productivity so far and profitability, and then any other color you can provide on the next group of stores and how they made different from the first set.","Bob Sasser","Yes, I would tell you that the rebanners are meeting our expectations. We started off as you know with an analysis of the stores that we thought could be better serve the customers as a Dollar Tree than a Family Dollar, and Family Dollars that were underperforming frankly because obviously we can improve the performance of those Family Dollar store by turning into Dollar Tree. We would like to take a look at doing that. We modeled against the Family Dollar, or the Dollar Tree model to come up with a large list and then we went through the process of reviewing those stores, actually going out and sending people out to visit the sites and put their eyes on it as well as having the analysis.","So from that is how we pick the first 200, 300 stores now. We'll continue the analysis. I would tell you that haven't learned a whole lot different from what we first did in regard to, and analyzing the Family Dollar stores again. They were underperforming Family Dollar stores that we put through the Dollar Tree real estate model, and from the Dollar Tree real estate model reach in with a sale projection, and from that we knew what we thought we could do as a Dollar Tree. So that's how we choose them. I don't think there is, it's really early. One of the reasons we're doing a hundred this year instead on maybe more is the fact that I would like to let the first 200 sort of burn in and have a few months. Some of them we've only had a few weeks on with results and mostly we only had a few months.","So with a little more time then I think we'll probably find some more opportunity to improve that model and to improve the location and rebannering project. But I would tell you it's exciting, the rebannering is absolutely hitting our expectations to what we can deliver. And by the way I think by running better stores, then obviously we can improve as we do in all Dollar Tree stores from opening to really going after the customers in those markets and running great stores for those neighborhoods.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks so much. And lastly, if I can then I'll yield. But on a transition service agreement you had talked about with the divested stores were then placed in the quarter. Is there any way to emphasize that? Thank you.","Bob Sasser","The TSA was in place in the quarter obviously from a standpoint of were divested of the 325 stores at the beginning of the quarter. We do support seeking more partners for these stores on an ongoing basis. And again as we called out last quarter, there are certain costs that we are incurring and expect to incur as part of that. On the flip side of that we do get some reimbursement as per the TSA for some of those services provided. It was on a go forward basis and my expectation is that it will be hopefully, it's fairly neutral but it's not totally known based on all the services that we have to provide, but we will be providing accounting services. The merchandise is still bought and distributed by us to those 325 stores. Yes, we're really accounting services and HR services and various things like that. So it's a fairly involved process realistically.","Stephen Grambling","Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck this year.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. Hey, good morning, Bob. ","Bob Sasser","Good morning, Dan. How are you?","Dan Wewer","Good. How are you doing?","Bob Sasser","I'm terrific.","Dan Wewer","On the 1% to 2% same-store sales gain at Family Dollar, were you initially thinking it could be a bit better than that given that you've taken the 200 underperforming Family Dollar stores out of there comp pays and as you eluded to the in stores banners are better, in stock levels are better. Do you feel like the Family Dollar segment could have achieved a little bit better same-store sales growth?","Bob Sasser","It's early, Dan. I think we can achieve better and more consistent same-store sales growth at Family Dollar, but there was a lot going on there including a clearance event that has ended sometime early November, and changing around the store, the end caps, getting rid of old merchandise, working on improving the in stock position setting, holiday merchandise that has already been bought and displaying that appropriately, and just engaging in the customers. So they really accomplished a lot of things at the Family Dollar business early on in addition to all the synergy work that's been done there, and combining with the shared services. So a lot was accomplished there. I'm pleased with where we came from with the Family Dollar.","Frankly, when we divested 325 stores, $500 million in sales, we rebannered 205 stores. All those moving pieces have an effect on the base. It's a lot to do for an organization in a short period of time, and at the same time the business environment in fourth quarter for consumers just wasn't as robust as you might have wanted to be. So let's give it a little more time. I expect it's going to continue to improve and I have great confidence in the management team to do the things to focus on the customer, engage with the customer and provide more value in that business, which that's where we're putting our focus. Just like Dollar Tree, we're going to run great store, we'll win by running great stores at Family Dollar.","Dan Wewer","Then a follow-up, also related to revenues. But when you look at the core segment, the Dollar Tree store sales per square foot is now the highest I believe since 2002, and of course back paying your stores were only -- the prototypes were only half of the size that it is currently. With that in mind, just mathematically, it's really difficult to get to 3% and 4% same-store sales growth because the denominator is so large. So now going forward, do you think 2% is kind of the appropriate bogey for the core segment same-store sales?","Bob Sasser","I wouldn't agree on the 3% to 4% not being out of reach or even more. I mean it's really about how well we served the customer and there are some headwinds out there from time to time in the economy and the economic environment, employment and all those things that we sort of whine about that we can't do much with. But at the same time they cycle in, they cycle out, and over the longer haul we can do more in our Dollar Tree stores. Our sales productivity per foot is not at the peak of where it can be. There is always or things that we can do, by expanding categories that are growing, by pulling back on categories that are declining by increasing the value, the idea of buying better with a combined larger company and leveraging the power of our vessel to buy better, to distribute goods better, the logistics costs, we have to be able to leverage those for both banners and provide more efficient and better supply in merchandise in stores. So model as you wish, but for the long haul I believe that our Dollar Tree can remain vibrant for years to come.","Dan Wewer","Do you think that you're at a point where maybe you need to reinvest some of that industry leading margin in the Dollar Tree segment back into the market share initiative?","Bob Sasser","We should always take a look at that and we should always let the market and the customer be our guide on what the value equation needs to be. Everything's a dollar, other retailers will raise or lower their prices. At Dollar Tree we change the product, we improve the value or take a little more in margin so we will continue to do that. I will tell you this though. There is really room, there's a lot of room in our operating margin to improve and one of the things I am most proud of is the sector leading operating margin and there's a few things we can do to improve that even though its sector leading, we can continue to grow that. We don't have to take away from it to invest in our customer. We can run our business better still and it's driven by a few factors.","First of all, we got to improve our DC cost. By improving our DC cost we will be able to improve our operating margin by the use of better staffing models and leveraging engineer standards we can improve our DC cost. Our shrink is higher than it should be. It's grown over a last couple of years. We can improve that. We have always been able to run a very well managed shrink component in our business and I expect that we are going to get back to a better shrink number. Unfortunately, shrink as you know as a tail once you know it and see it then all the initiatives you do to bring it back in line, don't show up until you cycle through some inventories in the line but we are on top of it and we can improve our shrink.","We will leverage our occupancy with our comp store sales increases with 32 straight quarters whether its 2%, 3% or 4% we will continue to leverage those fixed costs with our comp sales increase. And another big thing is by leveraging the combined companies as an individual banner, one plus one doesn't equal two here. If we start bringing together our shared services for both banners, we are going to lower costs across both banners in the back office function. So there is room for us to continue to grow our comp sales, there is room for us to continue to invest in our customer, be relevant and offer the best values in the business for a dollar and at the same time improve our operating margin.","Dan Wewer","Great, thank you.","Bob Sasser","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question will come from Joseph Feldman with Telsey. Please go ahead.","Joseph Feldman","Hi guys, good morning. I wanted to ask, you made a comment about the integration of systems and technology and I guess I just wanted to get an update on where that does stand because -- and how you're kind of platforming across the two businesses?","Kevin Wampler","Joe, well we have got a plan, a roadmap to, we are not doing everything in one time. Something's have to be done before you do the next step by the way, but we have a plan for that over the next three years of systems integration. We are doing a lot of work around what, bringing together shared services as priority, being able to for example get everyone on the same financial system so that we can pay all the bills the same way using the same system.","We are currently -- you heard me reference St. Georges, Utah, and we're currently working on combining and integrating the WMS systems. We are taking a Family Dollar bannered DC in St. Georges, Utah and we are doing that right now. We will start receiving sometime April-May, the Dollar Tree merchandise along with Family Dollar merchandise and we will start shipping testing after that. Shortly, after that it's a plan and of course, we get that right and we are confident we can do that other places, then we will begin rolling out and combining some others DCs as appropriate to do two things. One is to give us more capacity in the buildings we own whether it's Family Dollar that needs the capacity or Dollar Tree that needs the capacity by being able to ship both banners out of any building, will enable us to use capacity better.","And secondly, to improve the cost structure by rationalizing the DC network, getting the DCs in the right places to serve the right banner. So, that's some of the priorities that we have. We are going to keep the merchandising separate and some of the back office things to do with merchandising we will try to leverage but, Family Dollar buyers are going to be buying using Family Dollar systems and Dollar Tree will using the Dollar Tree systems. As far as retail purchasing right now we are going to combine some of the back office things and leverage our international sourcing, leveraging freight rates across both banners, leveraging our international organization across both banners, our QA, QC, all of those things we would be leveraging.","So that sort of gives you a color. There is a roadmap for the entire network system by system and it spans throughout the next three years with the most important things to clean the most value at the earliest at the front end. ","Joseph Feldman","Thanks. And just as a follow-up, can you help dimensionalize this $300 million in opportunities. I know there is this 4 buckets, I know about some of the merchandising ones probably coming earlier in the process of the three years but how should we think about how big each bucket is, going forward?","Kevin Wampler","Yes, as we have talked to them, the four buckets, the biggest one by far is the procurement bucket which includes both merchandise and non-merchandise spend basically and that's roughly, its over 60% of the overall $300 million, that's very wide net as you might imagine and not only when you think about all the things we buy, merchandise is merchandise, but when you look out to all those services and goods we buy as organizations, being able to leverage that across both organizations. Streamlined processes determined the best way to go forward for both banners is really very exciting and very powerful. So, that by far is the biggest bucket.","The second biggest bucket that we have spoken to in the past is the rebannering process and taking under-performing stores and turning them into stores that are performing at a higher level at an average Dollar Tree rate so, that's the second one and the third and fourth buckets are smaller. We have always said the distribution, logistics has the chance to be a number but it's a longer term project. So, to Bob's point when he was speaking to work being done today looking at systems and how do you ship both banners out of one distribution center that potentially has some big paybacks but it's a little further down the road so that's kind of directional how to think about it.","Joseph Feldman","That's helpful, thanks guys. Good luck with the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tricia Dillon","Good morning. This is actually Tricia Dillon for Matt. So I just had a question first on the core Dollar Tree margin that came in a little lighter than we expected and down versus last year compared to I think your expectations are relatively flat. Even as the deals marked down and if a deal came in a little above our expectations, just want to get a comment on what was different there versus your expectations in both segments and then I just had a follow up?","Kevin Wampler","Yes, I think on the Dollar Tree side of the equation, I think the deal was marked down by a known number and that was by far the largest portion of the decrease in our growth profit, on a lower comp we don't get as much leverage on occupancy and distribution as we normally would and again to the point of what we are trying to do there and it's about we know we can do better from a distribution standpoint and then shrinking the other item which we know we are not happy with our other performance this year and obviously have teams focused on that but that was a head win. What was really positive at the end of the day was that our merchandise cost continue to be better. The mark-on was up so we are buying better, freight was a benefit so a lot of things going really well there and that's very positive.","And then, we will continue to be positive I believe as we continue to go forward. I think the other thing I would say about the Dollar Tree business is even on a lower comp for the quarter and even the year we are able to leverage our SG&A expenses so to me that's very powerful to the model. There is a lot of companies that would not be able to leverage their SG&A at this type of a comp level so I guess part of our disciplined approach as we go forward. I think speaking to the Family Dollar business, I think in general the gross profit came in about where we thought it would, I think it would make some good strides the team that is working there, again a lot of work being done to make sure that the best net the cost that we can in a system and be able to track that and base our business off of that.","So I think that's very positive. I think as we spoke to in the prepared remarks, some of the head winds is far from a comparability stand point relate to incentive compensation, divestiture cost and some things like that. So over all I don't know if there were a lot of big surprises. Obviously if sales maybe would have been more towards, the good thing is sales were on the middle of the range, earnings were at the top end, towards the top end of the range. So I think the flow through is actually pretty good at the end of the day. So I think that's how we think about it.","Tricia Dillon","That's very helpful, thanks. And then just a quick clarification on the full year EPS guidance, last quarter you provided a reconciliation with CO adjustments leading to adjusted EBITDA. And just wondering if you can help us understand what those same adjustments would be for your '16 guidance?","Bob Sasser","Yes, I think we've really laid them out to you in the sense of the prepared remarks. Obviously, we talked about the fact that the inventory step up amortization is $6 million in Q1 and $2 million in Q2. As we look to the purchase accounting items that we've talked about since the day of the first quarter you'll continue to see lease, favorable lease rights, amortization, it's about $18.7 million for Q1, $74 million for the year and that $18.7 million steps down about $200,000 a quarter roughly at the end of the day. And then you have additional depreciation above the historical run rate related to the revaluation of assets in the change of policies, and basically that's about $8 million in Q1 and $5 million in Q2. So those are really the items as we see it.","So that's again what we gave them to you today in the prepared remarks and that should help you be able to do any of the adjustments that you want to within your processes. Our view point is we gave GAAP guidance today, that's we're going to continue to give GAAP guidance on a go forward basis. We think that's obviously the cleanest way. Obviously we're required to do that to begin with. But secondarily, the items are known, the adjustments are known now. I think everybody understands them and I think it will be cleaner for everybody.","Tricia Dillon","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Yes, we have a time for a few more questions. We'll go next to John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. My question is on merchandising at the Family Dollar stores. When you take a look at those stores and compare the model to the core Dollar Tree, is there any idea that maybe you can add some new categories of products to Family Dollar that might help to improve the productivity that simultaneously wouldn't take away sales from your core Dollar Tree stores?","Gary Philbin","Hey John, Gary Philbin. Good morning. Let me start by maybe just describing one of the reasons we did the acquisition was to have two compelling banners. So this is not an exercise to turn Family Dollar into Dollar Tree, and so we are rooted in the customers' reserve and where we serve them. So I'd like to make sure we're very clear, we're going to have a very productive Family Dollar banner with compelling assortments that we think fit the bill for the folks that shop us and that revolves off a lot around first of the month in delivering basics and giving them items that on discretionary basis they need to ground up their shopping trips. So starting with that I would say that's where we're grounded. But part of the synergy effort is having our merchants sit together, and just got back from our most recent trip in China where both our Family Dollar and Dollar Tree merchants are able to sit in the same room and take a look at items.","And so that's going to be a piece, trip after trip where merchants can sit in the same room and find the things that fit for Family Dollar, that for us means opening price point, great value, items that can imported that are private brands. All those things are going to take shape as we continue the iterations of our merchants gained together. So there is going to be some items that you might see in both banners, but if you're ever going to a Dollar Tree or Family Dollar and mistake one for the other we really miss the mark on that assortment. You're going to see two compelling stores in assortments and quite frankly even on the real estate side, where they left, which truly is a growth curve for both banners as we go forward. So I hope that helps.","John Zolidis","Thanks a lot for that answer.","Operator","And we can take our final question from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks guys. So as we think to the spring versus the fall of this year, what category should we keep an eye on in Family Dollar stores, more on the merchandising and the pricing front? And then anything to watch on the circular and promotional cadence?","Bob Sasser","Of course we start with delivering the basic side to our folks. We have 12 holidays a year, it's called first of the month. So we're spending a lot of energy at Family Dollar and making sure that our stores are ready. The investment that we want to make with our customer is really a kickoff around that time of the month where folks have money in their pocket to spend, and we want to be ready. So all the things that we've been working on, getting the non-go forward inventory clear down to get our hands better so that we can have our shelves better stocked. That's the effort we've made up to this point to go into the spring time. Now obviously we got Easter holiday ahead of us going into a season that is obviously spring and summer after that. But I would tell you an awful lot of what we're working on is delivering the basics everyday which our customer research says they'll give us credit for that if we're able to deliver on that week in, week out, month in, month out.","As far as promotional strategy, you might see we introduce smart ways to save, which really for me is a way of trying together what our customers are going to see. Our ads will reflect our stores, and so when you think about how you ought to save at a Family Dollar our customers are giving us credit now for everyday a little price, of course we've always had traffic drivers on our sale items. The company even before we bought them certainly had over $1,000 wow items in the store that customers love to shop. We have extensive private branch program that certainly lend, it's tough to compare and say I mean what we're introducing is price drop which is nothing new compared to other retails, but for us it's a way of delivering value to our customers in some of the items they shop most often. And so it's another arrow in our quiver that allows us to deliver value to our customers in a monthly basis, and truly a way of showing from ad to the store to even how we think about our customer shopping patterns, how the other come into a Family Dollar and shop.","So we think it's an exciting kickoff and really gives our merchants and really great support from our vendor community. Another way to drive more incremental cases at Family Dollar.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow up. With some of the tougher comps behind us, I guess just any comments on current business and within your 2016 guidance, what base case level of debt pay down is implied to get to the $360 million interest expense? Is there any opportunity for additional pay down as the year progresses and just where do you see the leverage ratio exiting the year?","Kevin Wampler","I'll take the debt piece, Matt. Basically the $90 million a quarter of interest there and $60 million assumes no additional pay down at this point in time. So obviously if we make the determination as we work to the year that we're ready to pay down additional debt it could have a positive effect, but at this point in time within the guidance there is no assumption of any additional pay down. So that's kind of where that stands at this point.","Bob Sasser","As far as current trends, obviously we've finished one period out of the three so we still got two period to go on the quarter, but I'm pleased with where we are. It's always -- you usually get a weather report sometime in February and when weather was adverse, it wasn't as good as we thought but overall we ended up with a good first period and on-track for a very good quarter. And frankly, I'm looking forward to a period of time when we don't have those disruptions like we had last year from the port strike, and I think you can see in our inventory, we have the inventory that we should have had last year. We have that inventory this year, so my expectation is that we're going to have a, we're on track for a good first quarter. Easter's a little early, the early Easters at Dollar Tree aren't usually good, so we've said that's a $10 million head wind. But at the end of the day, we've given you our first quarter guidance and any color on that is we're on track. ","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of Luck.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentleman, this does conclude today's Q&A Session. I'd like to return the floor to Randy Guiler for closing comments.","Randy Guiler","Thank you Keith, and thank you for joining us for today's call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree.

Good morning everyone. The third quarter represents another period of solid sales performance for both brands Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Our store optimization efforts and sales driving initiatives are working. The teams have completed more than 1,150 Family Dollar H2 renovations, nearly 200 Dollar Tree re-banners, and more than a 1,000 Dollar Tree Snack Zones, and launched our Dollar Tree Plus test already this year. These efforts have driven top line sales and transaction counts of both banners.","Fiscal 2019 has been a unique year as a result of several factors. We planned and accomplished the material acceleration of our Family Dollar store optimization initiatives and the consolidation of our two support centers to Chesapeake, Virginia. Additionally, the global helium shortage which has an outsized impact on our party business and the continued uncertainty regarding trade and the related tariffs have impacted our business.","I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s efforts and the sales execution through this environment. We worked hard to maintain focus on our customers and our values in stores. Our results for the third quarter included sales increase of 3.7% to $5.75 billion, consolidated same store sales increase of 2.5% and our EPS of $1.08 was within our guidance range.","Other highlights for the quarter included completing 247 Family Dollar H2 renovations, completing 512 Dollar Tree Snack Zones bringing our total to 2,087 across the chain and repurchasing 11.6 million shares as part of our share buyback program. In mid October, we hosted our fourth annual nationwide hiring event focused on hiring more than 25,000 associates in communities all across the country.","This event provides individuals with the opportunity to join the Dollar Tree or Family Dollar\u2019s teams. These new associates can earn the opportunity to be promoted through the field organization. As a growth company, we\u2019re always looking for talent and bench strength that can develop into future leaders in our stores. Our application flow was strong for the successful hiring event.","Regarding Dollar Tree segment sales highlights for the third quarter, we delivered a 2.8% comp, representing the twelfth consecutive quarter of comps exceeding 2%. Dollar Tree had increases in both traffic and ticket with traffic slightly outpacing the ticket increase. Geographically, all the zones comped positively, and we're at or better than 2%. Strongest performing zones were in the Northeast, the upper Midwest, and Southwest.","Our cadence of comps in the quarter, all three months were better than 2% with August being the strongest month. Dollar Tree continues to deliver solid positive comps in the consumables category, and our seasonal business continued to perform very well. In fact, Halloween was on par with a very good seasonal sell-through we've been experiencing over the past couple of years.","Our variety business, which includes party at Dollar Tree comped positive each month during the quarter but was again impacted by the helium shortage. We estimate that our comp was negatively impacted from lost balloon sales by about 20 basis points. We expect this helium shortage headwind to continue, but to a lesser degree for the remainder of 2019. The Dollar Tree marketing team continues to do a terrific job of delivering ever-changing and new product ideas that drive customer excitement and repeat visits. Dollar Tree WOW is the excitement that our customers have come to expect.","Snack Zones have started 27, we have rolled out to great success and we continue to extend this initiative into more Dollar Tree stores. Last year, we added Hallmark cards to all stores across the chain, and it has proven to be a great partnership and customers certainly love the Hallmark brand, the offering, and the value. And this year, we\u2019ve been rolling on a new program called Crafters Square. Crafters Square is now in more than 600 Dollar Tree stores and is a new and expanded selection of arts and craft supplies all priced at $1.","Feedback from stores and customers has been fantastic, and we\u2019ll continue to expand this traffic driving initiative to more stores going forward. The sharing of projects within the crafting community on Pinterest, Instagram, and other platforms has made this one of the quickest launches to our customers on a small base of only 600 stores.","Let me give you an update on Dollar Tree Plus. , As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we\u2019re conducting a test of multi-price points at select Dollar Tree stores and multi-price assortment is in increment of $2, $3, $4 and $5 that\u2019s been tested in a 115 stores. We just reached the six-month mark in the initial stores, as the majority of the test stores were added in June. And we\u2019re closely monitoring performance including impact to traffic, sales, margin, and of course customer feedback. As always, with tests we follow an interim process where we test, learn, modify, and improve along the way.","Our focus regarding multi price point tests as we finish this year and move into 2020 will be on delivering on great values to our shoppers within targeted categories, shifting more towards discretionary and unique products that we believe delivers the WOW factor to consumers and is additive to the basket and margin profile. Utilizing our broad vendor base to source these great value products, and ensuring as always that we protect the Dollar Tree brand.","Our brand is more than the items we sell for a $1. The Dollar Tree brand represents a pricing value and the customers get tremendous value for what they spend at Dollar Tree. Our efforts to drive this test should include extending our reach by adding great value, exciting merchandise, and opportunities to expand margin. We are still early in this test and look forward to updating you as the test evolves.","Family Dollar team delivered another quarter of positive comps with a 2.3% increase. Importantly, comparable transaction count for the quarter was positive, continuing the trend that began to emerge in midsummer. The team\u2019s performance demonstrates that efforts to improve the consistency of execution across the chain and efforts to drive H2 performance are working and are gaining traction.","For Family Dollar segment highlights for the third quarter, our consumables business performed very well delivering its 12 consecutive quarter of positive same store sales. Our cadence of comps through the quarter all three months were better than 1.5% with August being the strongest month. From our zone perspective, comps for six of our seven zones were positive with the strongest performance in the West, Southwest and Southeast zones.","Our Family Dollar customer service course for Q3 showed improvement from the prior year, categories of store cleanliness, product assortments, speed of checkout were among the notable improvements. We continue to believe we are taking the right steps to transform our customer experience to increase the frequency of the business. These steps include improving customer satisfaction, developing brand and price reputation, focusing on opening price points, incorporating better organized and focused Dollar impact sections and serving more of what our customers need including frozen foods.","And as we expected the average scores for H2 stores where we have invested in our fleet are higher across the board. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our H2 store format at Family Dollar. All new and remodel stores are in this format which is driving greater royalty, repeat business and value perception in these locations. These renovating stores continue on the average to deliver a comp greater than 10% in their first year post-renovation. We\u2019re committed to this format and plan to renovate at least 1,000 Family Dollar stores to the H2 format in fiscal 2020.","We began rolling out the H2 format in Q3 last year. We continue to like the sales that we\u2019re seeing in the H2 stores, now cycling into the second year. Our efforts to drive performance across the store base continued to focus on initiatives around our private brands with compare and save, our smart coupons that offer our loyal customers the latest and best values. Hallmark cards will be coming to all Family Dollar stores in 2020 and of course our store manager training and retention efforts as always to drive performance and consistency store-by-store.","In our store support center, we are seeing the benefits of having our teams Dollar Tree and Family Dollar together in one location. We anticipate being together will greatly enhance our culture, our ability to recruit great talent and improve the collaboration within our organization as we train and develop and provide even more and better support for our stores.","Looking at real estate for both segments in the third quarter, we opened a total of 165 new stores and 114 Dollar Trees, two in Canada and 51 Family Dollar. We relocated or expanded 12 Dollar Tree and three Family Dollar stores. We renovated 247 Family Dollars as part of our H2 renovation initiatives and we re-bannered 39 Family Dollars to Dollar Tree stores for a total of 463 projects during the quarter.","We also added freezers and coolers into a 138 Dollar Tree stores, bringing our total to stores of freezers and coolers to just over 6,000. During the quarter, we closed 42 stores, 12 Dollar Tree and 30 Family Dollars, and we ended the quarter with 15,262 stores, 11,447 Dollar Trees, 7,815 Family Dollars.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I\u2019d like to provide an brief update on tariffs just prior to our last earnings announcement August as USTR announced at tariffs on List 1, 2, and 3 prices were increased from 25% to 30% on October 1st, tariffs on List 4A price were increased from 10% to 15% on the September 1 and tariffs on 4B price were increased also 10% to 15% on December 30.","As noted in our August earnings announcement, our outlook provided at that time does not include any impact related to these changes. Our updated outlook includes approximately $19 million of cost to good sold with the expected impact from the USTR tariffs for List 1, 2 and 3 as well as Plus 4A and 4B tariffs were implemented in Q4. Nearly all the expected impact is related to the introduction of List 4A tariffs.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Wampler","Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Consolidated net sales for the third quarter increased 3.7% to $5.75 billion comprised of $3.07 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.67 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.5%. On a segment basis, same-store sales for Dollar Tree increased 2.8% compared and for Family Dollar increased 2.3%. Overall gross profit was $1.7 billion compared to $1.67 billion in the prior year quarter.","Gross margin was 29.6% of sales compared to 30.2% in Q3 of 2018. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 60 basis points to 34.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment\u2019s gross margin performance for the quarter included merchandise costs, including freight, increased approximately 55 basis points primarily due to higher freight cost. And distribution costs increased approximately 10 basis points primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation.","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 24.5% during the third quarter compared to 25.3% in the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year decline was due to the following. Merchandise costs including freight increased approximately 30 basis points, driven primarily by an increase in freight costs and higher sales of lower margin consumable merchandise partially offset by improved initial mark on.","Shrink increased approximately 15 basis points resulting from unfavorable physical inventory results in the quarter. Distribution costs increased approximately 15 basis points due to increase payroll cost at the DCs. Occupancy costs increased approximately 10 basis points due to an increase in real estate taxes and markdown expense increased by 5 basis points, resulting from higher clearance activity in the quarter.","Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales in the quarter increased 30 basis points to 23.5% from 23.2% in the same quarter last year. For the third quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales increased to 22.1% compared to 22% for the third quarter of 2018. The increase was due to store operating costs increased by approximately 15 basis points were going from increased debit, credit card fee penetration and an increase in loss of global success after an earlier lease termination in the quarter. Payroll costs decreased approximately 5 basis points primarily due to lower retirement plan expenses and lower insurance benefit expenses compared to the prior quarter partially offset by an increase in-store hour and payroll due to higher average hourly rates and additional hours to support store initiatives.","SG&A expenses for the Family Dollar segment were 22.5% of sales in the third quarter compared to 22.2% of sales in the same period last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to the net of the following. Operating expenses increased approximately 25 basis points, resulting primarily from higher costs related to the disposal of fixed assets in connection with our store optimization initiatives.","Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 10 basis points as a result of capital investment requirement to support H2 initiative. Corporate and support expenses increased 10 basis points, primarily related to store support center consolidation costs and higher depreciation. This included approximately $4 million of expenses related to the Q3 2019 discrete costs associated with our store support center consolidation. For the quarter, the Company incurred approximately $9 million in total discrete costs, which was consistent with our guidance.","On a consolidated basis, operating income was $358.4 million compared with $387.8 million in the same period last year and operating income margin was 6.2% of sales compared to 7% of sales in last year\u2019s third quarter. Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $41.5 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.3% compared to 17.1% in the prior year third quarter. The prior year quarter benefited by $15.7 million based on the Company substantial completion of our analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on a net deferred tax liability valuation. The current year tax rate reflects the benefit of statute expirations and the reconciliation of the tax provision to the tax insurance.","For the third quarter, the Company had net income of $255.8 million or $1.08 per diluted share. This compared to net income of $281.8 billion or $1.18 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents for quarter end totaled $433.7 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Our outstanding debt as of November 2nd was approximately $4.3 billion.","During the third quarter we purchased, repurchased approximately 125,000 shares for $11.6 million. At quarter end, we had $800 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We\u2019ll provide an update on additional share repurchases, if any following the quarter which they may occur.","Inventories for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 14.4% from the same time last year while selling square footage increased 7.5%. Inventory pursuance worth 6.4%, our inventory levels reflect the early receipt of imports to mitigate tariffs, we believe the current inventory levels are appropriate and support the scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the remainder of the year.","Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 4.2% from the same period last year an increase 0.9% on a selling square foot basis. Based on store closure for Family Dollar segment has 5.1% less square footage outstanding.","Capital expenditures were $279.8 million in the third quarter versus $228.4 million in the third quarter of last year; and for fiscal 2019, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion consistent with our initial outlook. Depreciation and amortization totaled $160 million for the third quarter and $150.5 million in the third quarter of last year. For fiscal 2019 we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $635 million.","We\u2019ve updated our outlook for fiscal 2019 and have lowered our guidance for Q4 based on the following expected effects. With regards to tariffs in USTR announcement we estimate Section 301 tariffs will increase our cost of goods sold by approximately $19 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the fourth quarter if the tariffs are fully implemented. Almost all of the cost is due to List 4A as its timing did not allow for significant mitigation.","We expect additional pressure on merchandize margin based on lower margin consumables growing faster than originally forecasted. We expect distribution costs to be higher than originally forecasted primarily due to payroll cost pressures from higher turnover which may affect productivity. The expenses related to repairs and maintenance, utilities and depreciation are now expected to have a higher run rate than originally forecasted.","Additional assumptions of our outlook are the calendar considerations for the remainder of the year which seems like there will be six year selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas which will natively impact Q4 sales. We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets, states increasing minimum wages or employment levels from completing the Company's initiative plans including H2 renovations and Snack Zones.","We estimate year-over-year domestic freight cost as a percent of sales to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter. Import freight rates as we noted on last quarter\u2019s call will increase based on our April rate negotiation and beginning in January 2020 as a result of low sulfur fuel requirements for ships.","Net interest expense will be approximately $41.9 million in Q4 and we cannot predict future currency fluctuations we've not adjusted our outlook for currency rate changes. As always our outlook assumes no additional shares purchases. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.3% for the fourth quarter and 21.4% for fiscal 2019. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 237.7 million of shares for Q4 and 238.2 million shares for the full year.","For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $6.33 billion to $6.44 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.70 to $1.80. Investments based on our low single-digit increase in same-store sales and year-over-year square footage growth at 1.1%. For fiscal 2019, we're now forecasting total sales to range between $23.62 billion and $23.74 billion based on a low single-digit same store sales increase at approximately 1.1% of selling square footage growth.","The Company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for the full fiscal 2019 will range between $4.66 to $4.76, which includes discrete cost of approximately $85 million or $0.28 per diluted share, approximately $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share of store closer related costs and approximately $19 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to tariffs.","I'll now turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Philbin","Thanks Kevin. Like I mentioned at the beginning of the call, 2019 has been a year of distinct opportunities. We planned and executed the material acceleration of our Family Dollar store optimization initiatives. Snack Zones resets at more than 1,000 Dollar Tree stores and the consolidation of our two banners to our store support center in Southeast Virginia. We accomplished that against the backdrop of the helium shortage and uncertainty regarding trade and related tariffs, continued impact of freight costs and DC costs affected by the increasing starting wage rates.","I'm proud of the sales results that both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar that were accomplished in the quarter. This is done in the first three quarters of the year with more than 2,000 stores disrupted from our initiatives. We invested in our stores, our starting rates in specific markets and have our fleet of stores ready for the fourth quarter and the key holidays.","As stated in today's press release, we also announced that we will do at least another 1,000 H2 renovations in 2020. Our confidence in this model grows as we have more across our fleet of stores and various types of settings, demographics, and densities of population. We will announce our new, we'll have another store level capital plans for 2020 at the end of Q4.","The impact on our gross margin in specific areas is ours to control and do better. We are focused on making improvements across several categories as we finish the year and start 2020. These areas include improving our shrink results, enhancing the efficiencies within our supply chain to better manage freight costs. Driving sales on the discretionary side of our business to reduce mix headwinds to margin and tariff mitigation efforts.","With shrink our plans are focused on enhancing allocations and right size inventories to all of our stores, especially those with a high shrink history. Continued focus on training throughout our field leadership district in-store teams, having loss prevention tools within our stores. And last week we're pleased to bring on a seasoned experienced retail executive in a senior VP role to lead both our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar asset protection teams.","The asset protection teams from both banners will report to him effective immediately, and our visibility to market issues external and internal will be enhanced with the combined teams in priority, high shrink markets. Our opportunities across our supply chain and freight costs are focused on optimizing our less than truckload inbound costs, fitting our key freight lanes and seeming to reward our best carriers by building that deliver on cost and service and getting back to our historical backhaul levels.","On the discretionary side at Dollar Tree, we're working hard to overcome our helium shortage with more party centered items to service our customers. For Family Dollar, we like what H2 has done for the top-line and transactions are focusing specifically around the impact on driving more discretionary within our stores. This includes our WOW tables, our dollar impact sections and the queuing assortment at checkout.","We still have more run way for all these discretionary sales in these areas. We're building on important categories that are doing well, especially around mom with kids across a combination of all things needed for young kids, including infant apparel and baby needs. Enhancing our party footprint with the addition of hallmark branded cards and Family Dollar through the first half of 2020.","For tariff mitigation, we are planning to continue our efforts to mitigate ongoing and potential new levels of tariffs as we head into 2020. These efforts include the continued support of many vendors to lower costs, the redesign of product packaging, efforts to shift mix between higher and lower cost products, awarding volume from multiple vendors to our most competitive suppliers, moving products out of China to reflect lower landed cost of goods.","In our combined team's purchasing power throughout all of Asia, and as always finding new vendors domestically and in other countries to develop the new and exciting values that our customers have come to expect. During the planning stages for 2020, we'll provide details related to 2020 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.","I believe our store chains are well prepared for the holiday season. I would like to sincerely thank each of our associates as we head into the fourth quarter and holiday season. More than 415,000 stores across the U.S. and Canada, our network of 25 distribution centers, and of course our store support center in Virginia. Thank all of them for their commitment, dedication and efforts to deliver value and convenience to our shoppers each and every day.","Finally, we continue to focus and make meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both brands. We are well positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increased value for our shareholders. The combination of more than 15,000 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers and all types of markets. The combination of two great brands provides great flexibility and managing our future growth.","Operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Can you talk about the margin profile on the remodeled Family Dollar stores? And related to that, given the mix that you have in those remodeled stores, which is much more consumable based. Is there a reason to believe gross margins can improve on go forward basis or has the higher mix of consumables in these stores effectively reset the gross margin profile for Family Dollar? Thanks.","Gary Philbin","Scot, this is Gary. We're pleased with H2 because when we went into this, we knew we were adding in more frozen food doors and some more food that obviously has an impact on margin. But we also went into it with the thought of let\u2019s offset that with some of what we do on immediate consumption, the queuing lines, the WOW tables, and I just think some better adjacencies to run the store.","Early on, we saw some degradation in margin, but as we sit here now, H2 is neutral to the fleet. But we didn\u2019t do this to be neutral, I really -- our goal here is to have margin expansion within H2. So, we\u2019re on the right path, we\u2019ve got traffic going in these stores and obviously you heard us call out the comp, our next workflow is to maintain all of that and add margin expansion to H2,. We like everything that the customers are telling us about it. We like the results on the top line in sales, and we got a good going on our margin mix now.","Scot Ciccarelli","And what kind -- on a go-forward basis, Gary, and that\u2019s helpful, but what kind of margin improvement do you think is realistic if we're looking out over the next, I don't know four to eight quarters, because I mean we\u2019ve seen several hundred basis points of gross margin degradation in that business, and I guess I just kind of keep coming back to the question, do we have a true reset here or is that something once we establish the better top line, we can kind of dig our way out?","Gary Philbin","So, I\u2019ve already said, we need to get to an inflection point on the fleet. We were rebuilding the stores, basically one store at a time with H2. We did over 1,000 in the first three quarters this year. We\u2019re planning on doing 1,000 next year. I need the top line sales. I think that\u2019s what H2 has given us. The work on the margin you know Q3 for Family Dollar, I think it was about an 80 points difference year-over-year comparison.","The expansion that can rise across the whole fleet are some of the things I\u2019ve' talked about. We got to focus on the discretionary, seasonal, apparel, electronics, all those are the categories that I think get teed up in the right way in H2. It doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of the fleet can't benefit from some of the same elements and efforts across the fleet.","So, we\u2019re putting together our 2020 plan with the specific initiatives around those discretionary categories to drive -- maybe get the same benefit that we've really seen on the consumable side. We\u2019ve got more folks coming through the front door here, and that is as important as anything than we do, and now I got to get them over the others side of the store to buy more of the discretionary products, that\u2019s doable. More to come when we announce our 2020 plan.","Operator","We go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, at what point do you think you\u2019ll have a reasonable level of visibility into the business? The factors that you mentioned outside of tariffs that contributed to your 10% to 15% decline, the reduction in your 4Q guidance including mix, payroll pressure at DCs, and increased run rates for repairs and maintenance, utilities and depreciation should have been somewhat known and not really surprising. So is it, once you get past this, then as we get into the first part of next year, do you feel confident that you\u2019ll have a level of visibility into the profitability of this business or is it going to take longer than that?","Kevin Wampler","Michael. It's Kevin. Yes, I think as we look at the items we called out, obviously the shift in mix as we\u2019ve seen the -- basically the consumable business outpaced even what we had forecasted. And really that\u2019s in both brands more so in the Family Dollar brand and the Dollar Tree brand, but it\u2019s in both brands. So, the Dollar Tree brand, we\u2019ve got some good things going with frozen food, refrigerated, and in our center aisle as well, so a lot of things going on there.","And again, a little bit of overall effect from the helium shortage and the halo effect to the party department in general. On the Family Dollar side, obviously, we haven't seen the discretionary business kick in as well as we'd like it to Gary, what he's just speaking to. A lot of opportunity there, getting customers in the door is key, obviously, and getting the foot traffic and having that opportunity to sell them that discretionary item is very, very important.","I think if we honestly look at other pieces of the business, obviously we called out DC costs. Really this is not an area we've called out in the past so much, it's really been more of a -- more bigger topic as of late as we've gone into the, we would call our seasonal peak here in the end of Q3 and beginning of Q4 as we look at basically getting all the merchandise through these buildings. And with unemployment where it's at, it's obviously required us to bring up basically starting wages and making sure we can engage with those associates and train them appropriately.","Gary Philbin","Michael. It's Gary. I would just add there is so keep in mind, this was a year that, with everything we've been talking about the beginning of the year. The store initiative, 2,000 stores at various times torn up, keep in mind at a DC level, we're also not just shifting re-banners back and forth, we are also shifting product back and forth especially with the impact of our dollar sections and some of our while items. So that a lot of going, we combined a store support center too. With all those balls in the air I give credit to our store teams and our store support teams to get that done.","Every time, we're talking about here gives us the consistency and visibility as we go forward in '20. We have done all this, really with major initiatives both in our store base and our store support center. So, listen the things that we're focused on are the right things to drive the business. And with all that going on, we drove sales throughout the year and with H2 stores building a momentum throughout the year. I'm really pleased with where we add up on the top line and initiatives around the margin piece, we got to get after on each of them.","Michael Lasser","Totally reasonable Gary, it just seems like investors want some timeframe when they can hold you accountable to an improvement in profitability and better visibility because there have been a lot of disappointments over the last few years, and having some sense of when then my turn will be helpful to the investment community? And as part of that, are you still committed to the 14% to 18% EPS growth off your original GAAP guidance that you provided earlier in the year for 2020? And why would that no longer be the case?","Kevin Wampler","Michael, as we said before, that was at a point in time, what we knew at that point in time, obviously, we're working through and finishing up our 2020 plans. Obviously, the biggest unknown as we sit here today for us and many other retailers is tariffs and where does that land at the end of the day. So honestly, we're committed to improving our business and improving on the many things we've talked about already this morning. But what are, we'll give obviously guidance when we get to our fourth quarter call. And hopefully we'll have some clarity around all those things.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","I know you give guidance on consolidated basis but to the extent possible, could you give maybe a little bit more detail regarding your expectations per banner, as we think about comps and gross margin and SG&A into fourth quarter? And then as a follow-up, just bigger picture for Dollar Tree, margins looks like they're going to be down this year, and just curious, if you can walk through what some of those, what you view as more temporary in nature, as we kind of turn the page into 2020? Is this a business that you believe can get back to expand the margins? Thank you.","Kevin Wampler","Paul, this is Kevin. I think as we look at it, again, we don't give guidance by banner. Obviously, when you look at it from, what I can give you a little feel for Q4. If you look at the guidance we gave today and you can back into a range of operating income based on all the data we've given you.","And I would tell you that it's basically a little right around 9% or just above. If you compare that to prior year excluding the items such as the markdowns for a good inventory and store impairment, I would tell you the pressure between basically gross profits and SG&A is fairly consistent. So, we're seeing pressure on both line items. So, that just gives you some directional ability to think about that.","I think as we look at this year and as we look at obviously the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter is a big quarter for Dollar Tree from a seasonal perspective so we get a pretty good boost in sales just from a seasonal set, which obviously is always provided us the ability to basically provide a good gross margin.","And I don't see that in the, but our seasonal set this year performed very well. We had a very good Halloween set. We had a very good performance with our Halloween seasonal and feel good about going into the fourth quarter with our Christmas set. So, I think that always bodes well. Obviously, we do have the 6 less selling days, but that doesn't mean we're not going to try to make sure we do everything we can to get every last sales dollar that we can at the end of the day.","Gary Philbin","Paul. It's Gary. Let me sort of answer your question, what's temporary and start with Dollar Tree. The things that have we've been chasing this year, start with shrink, it's about banner issue, but shrink is something I have an expectation we're going to do better on next year. We're coming off of a second year of not great performance and we can do better. I think the freight fees we started talking about it last year was certainly a bigger impact in the first half. We're going to see some of that modify in the second half, but we're still significantly up year-over-year.","And the distribution costs, I think, firstly, I don't know, if it's temporary or not. I know that impacts us when we have more folks coming into a DC and it's really not even once you had to pay folks again in the DC, it's almost productivity that you lose in the DC because you got new folks that you got to train and retain. Those are the things that I think were the one offs for both banners that I would expect us to make improvement on and the issues we\u2019ve talked about.","The mix on product to me is bigger issue at Family Dollar than it is at Dollar Tree. We are happy with what H2 has done, but across 2019 we\u2019ve worked hard on keeping sales going. And we just got to find some of the same elements that drive customer traffic into those sections as they do on the consumables.","For Dollar Tree, no I don\u2019t know how to think about tariffs, but as always it\u2019s going to be about incorporating the next WOW into the store. We like what Snack Zone has done, put a little pressure on mix that\u2019s what we get Crafter's Square going. A year before that we\u2019ve started on snack zone, but we put in the Hallmark. So, it's always what we push and pull with what to drive customers on both foot traffic and sales and margin. We\u2019re going to do that again as we go into '20. So, this is going to be pieces that we talk about category-by-category.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith","Hi. Thanks. Good morning everyone. So I want to look at the tariff impact, certainly it\u2019s been a very volatile situation with a lot of the unmet changes. It sounds like that the impact in Q4 is really just because of the timing with that 4A incremental didn\u2019t have time to adjust. Are you still confident if you look at 2020 and if you think you'll be able to mitigate most of the List 3 and List 4 tariff pressures?","Gary Philbin","Peter, its Gary. List 1, 2, 3, I think the teams have done through a couple of cycles now of working with our vendors to, either we fill our cost or redesign packaging, so we can land it. And in some case we\u2019re moving outside of China as you\u2019ve heard us talk about and even on those class trips as we are buying already following Halloween next year we\u2019ve moved additional product out of China. So, you\u2019re not going to pick up that entire supply chain, but that\u2019s what we do sometimes item-by-item, vendor-by-vendor as we see those opportunities.","As we go into 4A and 4B, it's more of our product and as always I want to go into 2020 I think with some compelling product and we\u2019re going to do the smart things around what we have to do to the best we can to mitigate. But I've also told our merchant teams at the end of the day. I want to be able to see what it is we might be changing or the opportunity to move product away from a vendor to another country before we do it. So 4A, what we\u2019ve seen is we\u2019re going to announced and we don\u2019t have much time to mitigate and that\u2019s what we\u2019re calling out with the Q4 impact.","Going forward, when we get a chance to get on regular cycle buy and meet with our vendors, yes we can mitigate more of it, I just don\u2019t have full vision of that till we go on a big buying trip in January which will be our first time really to meet with all of our vendors and I\u2019m assuming at that point 4B is in effect as WOW.","Peter Keith","Okay. Thank you for that. And then just on the discussion of mix particularly with the H2 remodels. One thing I\u2019m trying to get my head around is, it seemed that with the increase of $1 items that you\u2019d be experiencing greater buying scale with similar items from Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. So it does seem to me at least from the outside that there would be some benefits to mix from $1 item. So, are we misreading that or is it just that the discretionary weaknesses, this overarching negative on the business?","Gary Philbin","No, you heard me talk a little bit about an H2 four-wall margin that's about neutral to the fleet. And so the overall mix change that we're experiencing is no different have H2. What's different is that we invested heavily with more of our lower margin frozen food and additional expansion of some key categories in center to store food as well. That's lower margin. That's been offset, you're exactly right, with the impact of the dollar sections with the queuing assortment, with dollar WOW tables with immediate consumption.","So, the fact that we're back to fleet neutral margin, I think shows the power some of the sessions we just put up another level to get margin accretion going in an H2 store. So, the way I look at with the team, we almost take a look at, here's the sections we've invested in, what our sales and margin on a frozen food category and is that being offset with some of those other sections. And that's pretty much what we're seeing right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey.","Joe Feldman","Just want to get a little more understanding of like the higher price point testing from what, how are people responding to that so far?","Gary Philbin","I would say as folks come in, I would say it's one-third folks have seen the product and buy it. One-third of our loyal customers have commented that they don't like the market price point in our stores, and one-third or somewhere in the middle. Here's my view from everything we interviewed our customers with. It's not so far, we've had a priority on more consumables, which I think were an item that we want to test get out there across categories.","The next phase of the test is more about what I would call the Dollar Tree WOW side of it. We went over on our buying trip this July to buy specific categories. So, I would call them more on our variety discretionary side things that people haven't seen, and we'll see how customers respond. But I think that's more to what our customers are going to enjoy seeing incredible values on and allow us under our Dollar Tree WOW umbrella to say that's a great item, I don't see anywhere else.","And I know that costs more when I do see it. And I think that's going to be what we push on into some of those showing up in stores now by the end of 2020. So when we get a chance to test and learn and put new products and especially when we can design them and import them or find discretionary items domestically, I just think that's going to be the next phase of the test that gives us another important data point.","Our customers that buy it tend to buy more than the average Dollar Tree transaction, but I go back to what's success, and success in this is really to increase the reach of Dollar Tree to another segment of customers, and another chance to increase margin as well and as always protect the brand to say, this is the WOW factor at Dollar Tree.","So, those are the things that are in the mix. I think we have some exciting product coming in and we stay close to watching that week-by-week.","Joe Feldman","And then one follow-up on, I know you outlined a couple of efforts on the freight side that you can do that like optimize LTL and back to historical backhaul levels. Like how challenging a project is that to improve the freight side. Like is that something that we can see happened pretty quickly into next year?","Gary Philbin","Well, we are seeing some modest year-over-year declines right now a little bit. And the things that we're doing, we're in control. But we need to bid on the process. Now somebody has to sign up for the lower bid and give us great service, both an in-bound and out-bound to get those rates. So I'd like to think that it's something that as we read this some of the same headlines. We are not in the same position as a truck driver shortage exactly at this time a year ago.","I think that bodes well for us. The opportunity when we get better service on the outbound allows us to do more backhauls. So we're going into 2020, pushing all the levers we know to do to get both lower freight and better service. And we'll understand better ones are important third-party suppliers and independent truckers continue to give us service as we expect to, as we finish out Q4 into 2020.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we have time for just a couple of more questions. We'll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","Gary, curious when you think about the real estate composition of the thousand remodels you're going to do with Family Dollar this year, this coming year. How will that be different than this past year? Is there a desired any cluster more and if you do cluster more can that lift the brand perception at non-remodeled stores, if you do that?","Gary Philbin","Well, when we do take a look where's the number of stores, we went into this knowing that we wanted to fix some of the older stores in the fleet. So based on the last year's talks, we went into with the best opportunity based on volume. We did need a certain size. And really what we're skating to is, by the time we face these next thousand, we ought to be close to 40% of our fleet or a little better, being less than 5 years old. And I think to your point that, does give our customer a different perception of what they've seen at Family Dollar.","So, it's not necessarily that everything has to be H2. We got some great stores out there that are not, but we are changing the face of what the customer sees with this store initiative along with what we close, along with what we re-bannered to Dollar Tree. So, the combination of all those things gets us closer to an inflection point, which is I think what you're talking about what there's a customer see, and when inside the store that consistency around store standards, conditions and stocks are important across all the factors of the different stores that we run.","So that's what we're aiming for. And as we get more and more stores with the same opportunity, we're still measuring it what's our biggest return on capital as we go and invest in these stores, but I think just by the nature of our fleet with where we are across the country we\u2019re starting to get some critical mass into some key geographies.","John Heinbockel","And then lastly, when you look at the private brand penetration opportunity, recognizing it's all consumable at FDO. But is that another 500 basis point penetration opportunities or much bigger than that? Where do you think that shakes out?","Gary Philbin","So, we\u2019ve already said we\u2019re in the low 20s as a brand which is pretty darn good. I mean it\u2019s not grocery stores because we're not a grocery store. But I think across the categories, what I would like to see is something closer to a 100 basis point improvement consecutively over a number of years, I think that\u2019s the opportunity in front of us. And I think it speaks to one having great product and values in stores. And number two, our customer just needs it because she's stretching a budget and the commitment on what we compare and say to national brands.","I think fits in our wheel house. I think the magic to it as always is introducing customers, because they'll step up to private brands on something that first, is something that they try on because of the detergent and then they\u2019ll go to HPA products and then they\u2019ll go to food products. And the team has done a wonderful job on rebranding across the different categories and I think that\u2019s opportunities still with runway to it.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. Just one clarification question on tariffs and the bigger picture question. In terms of the $19 million, is it still fair to think of that split kind of 70% Dollar Tree and 30% Family Dollar in terms of the impact? I think that was the original split that you gave back a couple of quarters ago.","Kevin Wampler","Karen, as you look at the $19 million, it's more skewed to Dollar Tree than the 70%. So, the vast majority really relates to Dollar Tree. Small piece does relate to Family Dollar.","Karen Short","And then I guess just in terms of Family Dollar 2.0, I guess, I\u2019m wondering if you could give a little color on what the second year sales lift is? I know it's still early days, but any color there? And I guess maybe a little color on, why you think it's -- you\u2019re having more challenges in terms of getting the discretionary spend in those stores?","Gary Philbin","I would say, when we think -- let me answer your second question first. It\u2019s still a customer that comes in and I think as responding to what we\u2019ve done. I mean you just buy consumables on a weekly basis, the discretionary is tied sometimes to the season, but more times when I have for our customer a little more jingle in our pocket across the discretionary category. So, it\u2019s a piece of always we got to have the right values in front of our customer, across each of the category.","So, maybe a part of this Karen, I would even say as we went in just knowing 2,000 stores is going to be disrupted a 1,000 plus at Family Dollar, we ended this year saying this is not the year to not to have foot traffic coming in H2 has been giving that to us. We\u2019ve been hitting the gas, so it\u2019s not just been H2 that\u2019s driving the comp, so all boats have been rising. And I think that is important with knowing we were going to have the down stroke on the store initiative going into it.","So, I think we\u2019ve had some better compelling values in front of the customer on the consumable side, and not that we give all those thoughts that how we lay down the store, but I think got to get back to the basics of blocking and tackling on the discretionary side. What was your other piece of the question?","Karen Short","Year two, H2 comp?","Gary Philbin","We'd like the comps, I'd like to -- as we get more stores into this, I mean, we just finished up a 1,100 and change of H2. That profile has stayed consistent with the addition of more stores across geographies, across densifications of population. So, we do like that. I think as we get into the second year here, it's their stores are still cycling some of their grand opening activities from last year, so more to come as we get more stores into that bucket.","Karen Short","Okay. Can I just have one more question regarding Dollar Tree banner?","Gary Philbin","Sure.","Karen Short","Is there any variation in terms of this various stores on urban versus suburban versus rural? I mean, you kind of gave that third, third, third comment in terms of the customer response, but is there any pattern on underneath those markets in particular?","Gary Philbin","For Dollar Tree?","Karen Short","Yes.","Gary Philbin","Or Dollar Tree plus?","Karen Short","Yes.","Gary Philbin","No, I wouldn't say, I can't tell you there's a nuance here that really says as much of a difference. I think it's more about the product, Karen, than anything else at this point.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our final question today from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","So, Gary, maybe larger picture, how would you assess the health of the low income consumer today? Any changes to the competitive landscape that you've seen impacting any of your strategies or is it best is your thing primarily that this is company specific execution here?","Gary Philbin","Well, listen, we've been building, rebuilding our execution and rebuilding our banner. So I think that speaks to satisfying this customer. I think that's what H2 calls out that when we get a shopping environment that's compelling, exciting, and has the items they want, they'll respond to it.","To answer your question on the customer, yes, I think unemployment at an all-time low. I think folks in general can find a job these days. I think the opportunity is still often times there, one doctor bill or one car repair bill away from not being in such good shape. And that's really our opportunity to make sure that we have the right items to help them navigate budget from beginning of the month to the end of the month.","So, I would say things are maybe slightly better because of jobs. But I never like to stray too far from a customer that is keenly focused on value, convenience, and that's the cross hairs of our Family Dollar ought to just win the customer with everything we've been talking about with H2 and the entire fleet.","Matthew Boss","And then, Kevin, maybe just to follow-up on gross margin. At the Dollar Tree banner, so this is the second straight quarter of 55 basis points and merchandise cost headwind that of freight and 10 basis points of distribution pressure. How do these two items specifically shape up to the fourth quarter? And then do you still view 35% of the structural multiyear gross margin for the Dollar Tree concept?","Kevin Wampler","I think, as we look at it, as we said, we look at freight in fourth quarter, we said domestic, we feel like we're headed in a little bit better direction could be flat to slightly down year-over-year. So that's a good news item. Obviously, somewhat offset by the fact that our import freight is going up.","So I think overall, I think we would look for the freight effect maybe to be a little less as we go through Q4. I think as we look at just margin in general, obviously as we've talked about, helium is a component of this. It does affect. It does have a halo effect on whether it's one of our biggest departments, and one of our most profitable departments.","And we'll feel a little bit of assets, the team is working really hard to create the other exciting items within that department that will drive that business whether we have helium or not, which obviously we're working hard to make sure we have helium as well. So moving pieces there, I would expect though, that as we do the things we need to do to execute on improving our freights going forward, that you'll see it'll be less of an issue as we get into Q4 in the New Year.","Operator","And this does conclude our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Randy Guiler for closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Thank you, Aaron, and thank you for joining us for today's call. Our next quarterly earnings conference calls to discuss Q4 and full year results is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, March 4, 2020.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Tim Reid, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy Reid","Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, and welcome to the Dollar Tree conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in our business. Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2013.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K, all of which are on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements, and you should not expect us to do so. [Operator Instructions]","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, our President and CEO. Bob?","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced the following results for the first quarter 2013. I'm pleased to report that our comp store sales increased 2.1% in the quarter. This was on top of a 5.6% comp in the first quarter last year and a 7.1% comp the year before. Traffic grew 1% and average ticket increased 1.1%.","Total sales grew 8.3% to $1.87 billion. Operating income increased by $28.6 million or 15.2%. Operating margin was 11.6%, an increase of 70 basis points over first quarter last year. Net income increased 15% to $133.5 million, and earnings per share increased 18% to $0.59 compared with first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.50 per share.","I'm very pleased with these results. Gross margin increased 20 basis points, driven by an increase in merchandise margin and leverage of occupancy costs with a 2.1% sales comp. SG&A expense decreased 50 basis points. And as a result, operating margin increased 70 basis points to 11.6%. That's the highest first quarter operating margin we have ever produced, breaking the record set in the first quarter last year.","This did not happen by accident, and I'm particularly proud of our Dollar Tree associates who work everyday to deliver on our promise of great value merchandise and a clean, bright and fun place for our customers to shop. The merchant teams continue to source and develop product that exceeds the customers' expectations of what $1 can buy. The product selection and assortment day in and day out is of the highest value and more relevant to our customers than ever.","New customers are finding Dollar Tree and Deal$ to be shopping destinations, and our store teams are working very hard to keep these customers coming back by delivering on our promise of a store that is clean, bright, friendly and full of merchandise energy.","Seasonal transitions in the first quarter were well executed, fresh assortments arrived in a timely manner and our stores transitioned seamlessly from one season to the next, while consistently maintaining high levels of in-stock on basic items that customers need everyday, alongside seasonally relevant and fun discretionary product.","Our sales growth in the first quarter came from a mix of both basic consumable and discretionary products. Our top performing categories included stationery, candy, party supplies and health care products. In addition, our Valentine's and Easter seasonal categories performed very well. Our sell-through and transition to Mother's Day and Spring Fling was accomplished efficiently. In fact, all together this quarter, our discretionary business grew faster than consumables, a differentiating factor for Dollar Tree.","We believe that our model is right for all times. We offer the customer a balanced mix of needs-based consumer products, alongside high-value seasonal and basic discretionary product, and it's all at $1. You can splurge at Dollar Tree and you can still balance your budget.","In terms of geography, performance in the first quarter was relatively consistent across the country as all zones achieved positive comp store sales. The highest comps were in the Southwest, followed closely by the Southeast. Overall, our comps were positive every month, with our strongest performance in April.","Looking forward, we're excited about our growth potential and continued relevance to the customer. Our plan is to continue growing our business by providing more value to a broader range of customers, and we're doing this in several ways. The first way is through organic new store growth. And during the first quarter this year, we opened 94 new stores, relocated and expanded 16 existing stores and grew total square footage 7%. We ended the quarter with 4,763 stores, and we're on track with our plan for the full year, which includes 340 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 415 projects across the U.S. and Canada.","This is in addition to the 25 new stores and 5 relocations that we completed early, and we opened them in January. In the past, we've chosen not to open stores in January but, through the efficiency of our store development teams, that's changing, and we like the results.","In addition to generating incremental sales in fiscal 2012, these stores will be generating a full year of sales in 2013 and improved productivity. As a reminder, square footage growth this year is planned to be 7.3% over fiscal 2012.","In addition to opening more stores, we have a strategy to open better and more productive stores. I'm particularly pleased that average new store sales per square foot have increased consistently for 7 years. Last year, new store productivity grew to its highest level since 2001. While it's still very early, I'm pleased with the productivity of this year's new store class, and I'm happy to report that we're ahead of plan.","Increasing sales per square foot requires a team effort. It requires a focus on improved site selection and rightsizing our stores to the market and it requires developing more productive floor plans, expanding assortments with a focus on the most productive categories of merchandise, and opening stores faster through improved staffing and building the bench of qualified store management.","Efforts to increase sales per square foot are not limited to new stores. Elements of the strategy to increase store productivity can be seen throughout the chain. In all stores, we're developing more powerful seasonal presentations to create interest and a fun shopping experience. Across the chain, we're expanding our assortments in candy, stationery, health and beauty care and home and household products to maintain relevance to our customers.","After Easter and with great success, we have re-merchandised our checkout lanes and expanded our assortments at the front end of our stores to create more merchandise energy and to drive impulse sales. Store associates are emphasizing more effective customer engagement and working to drive sales of related items through cross merchandising and suggestive selling. And to satisfy basic needs and to drive increased shopping frequency, we continue to expand our frozen and refrigerated product to more stores. In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 229 additional stores. This is the most installations we have ever done in one quarter. We now offer frozen and refrigerated product in 2,778 stores.","This category is extremely productive. It serves the current needs of our customer, drives traffic into our stores and provides incremental sales across all categories, including our higher-margin discretionary product. Our plan now is to expand frozen and refrigerated product to a total of 550 additional stores this year. This is an increase from our original plan of 475 installations.","Another key component of our growth strategy is the development of new retail formats, the expansion of our geographic reach and the development of additional channels of distribution, specifically, that means Deal$, Dollar Tree Canada and Dollar Tree Direct.","Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ stores deliver low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deal$, we're able to serve more customers with more products at value prices every day.","Awareness of the Deal$ brand is growing and the concept is building momentum. In the first quarter, Deal$ had particular success in Valentine's and Easter seasonal merchandise, as well as stationery, lawn and garden, automotive and home decor. We added 8 new Deal$ stores in the first quarter, ending the quarter with a net total of 200 Deal$ stores across 19 states. And we're on track with our growth plan for 2013.","Our Canadian integration and expansion continues on schedule. Through our early investments in infrastructure, systems and training, we now have consistent year-on-year data on which to base our sales and assortment planning.","Our merchant teams are leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree in Canadian customers and our Canadian customers are beginning to find broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores.","In the first quarter, Canadian customers responded favorably to our Valentine's Day and Easter efforts. With high-value Dollar Tree merchandise, alongside domestically sourced Canadian products, our Canadian customers continue to be wowed by the product variety and value. And we're aggressively expanding our Canadian store base. We opened 11 new stores in the first quarter under the Dollar Tree Canada brand and ended the quarter with 151 Canadian stores, well on our way to achieving our plan to grow our store count by 25% for the year.","In addition to opening new stores, we're re-merchandising and re-branding existing stores. Last year, we re-branded all the former Dollar Giant stores in Ontario to Dollar Tree Canada. Our customers have responded favorably to the re-branded stores that reflect Dollar Tree on the outside and an exciting new merchandise layout on the inside. We will complete the transition with the re-branding of the stores in the Western provinces by the end of third quarter this year.","We see enormous potential in Canada. As previously reported, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000-store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. Our goal is to be the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25, just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point.","Adding to our growth strategy, Dollar Tree Direct, our e-commerce business, is exciting and growing. This additional channel of distribution provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores.","To give you some highlights, in the first quarter, our online traffic increased 23% over the first quarter last year. Over 1.7 million people visited the mobile version of our site in the first quarter, as more and more people are using their smartphones for their online shopping.","In addition to dollartree.com, in the first quarter, we launched a world-class e-commerce site for Deal$. You can now shop the deals-stores.com site, where we have over 3,000 items available for sale.","Whether shopping in our stores or online, our focus on engaging with existing and potential customers via social media continues. We're using YouTube, Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter and text messages to interact and engage our customers wherever they are. Feel free to check us out online. There's always something exciting going on at Dollar Tree and Deal$.","One of the keys to achieving consistent profitable results has been our practice of building infrastructure and distribution capacity to support growth ahead of the need. In that regard, I want to update you on the status of 3 projects.","First, construction on our new 1 million square foot distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut, has been completed, ahead of schedule and under budget. We're now receiving merchandise at the new facility, and we will begin shipping to stores in early June. DC10 is automated and designed to increase capacity and provide cost-effective service to our stores as we continue to expand in the Northeast.","Second, we're expanding DC8 in Marietta, Oklahoma, from 600,000 square feet to 1 million square feet. The expansion is proceeding on schedule, with plans to be operational in third quarter. Both the Marietta expansion and the new Windsor DC are being financed through available cash.","Third, during the first quarter, we entered into a lease on a 350,000 square foot adjacent building in San Bernardino, California. This additional capacity is already operational and is helping us to meet the growing demand for our merchandise in the Southwest.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you more detail on our financial metrics and provide guidance. Kevin?","Kevin S. Wampler","Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 18% in the first quarter to $0.59 per share. The increase resulted from our strong sales, a 20 basis point increase in gross profit margin and a 50 basis point reduction in our total SG&A expense compared to the first quarter last year.","Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 35.2% during the first quarter compared with 35% in the first quarter last year. Our merchandise margin improved due to higher initial markup and leverage on occupancy and distribution expenses, reflecting the 2.1% comp store sales growth. The improvements were partially offset by increased shrink expense and higher freight costs due to higher trucking rates compared to the same period last year.","SG&A expenses were 23.6% of sales for the quarter, a 50 basis point improvement from the first quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses declined by approximately 35 basis points, reflecting lower incentive compensation expense compared with last year, improved labor productivity in our stores and leverage associated with the comparable store sales increase.","Operating expenses declined by approximately 15 basis points due to improvements in advertising, repairs and maintenance and inventory service expenses as a percent of sales. These were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses.","Operating income increased $28.6 million compared to the first quarter last year, and operating margin was 11.6%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the 10.9% operating margin in the first quarter last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.1%, consistent with our guidance. This compares with a 38.4% tax rate in the first quarter of last year.","Cash and investments at quarter end totaled $383.3 million compared with $382.3 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2012. During the first quarter, we invested $68.4 million for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares. At quarter end, we had $791 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter was 225.2 million.","Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 15.4% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 7%. Consolidated inventory per selling square foot at cost increased by 7.9%. This reflects primarily an increase in goods in our supply chain, including inventory for our new DC in Windsor, Connecticut, as well as the inventory in the 312 net new stores that have been added since the end of the first quarter last year, and merchandise to support our initiatives in stationery, checkout, party and graduation. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives.","Capital expenditures were $103.2 million in the first quarter of 2013 versus $65.4 million in the first quarter last year, reflecting our investments to expand distribution capacity.","For fiscal year 2013, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million compared with $312.2 million in fiscal year 2012. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 550 stores, IT system enhancements and approximately $37 million towards the new Windsor, Connecticut, distribution center and $25 million for the expansion of our DC in Marietta, Oklahoma.","Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter totaled $45.1 million versus $41.8 million in the first quarter last year. We expect depreciation expense to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million for the year.","Our guidance for the balance of 2013 includes the following assumptions. First, we were pleased with the results of our May 1st ocean freight negotiations, which were consistent with the assumptions in our previous guidance. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, this year there are 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which represents a $25 million sales challenge in the fourth quarter. Also, as you will remember, due to the retail calendar, 2012 included 53 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 14 weeks. This extra week added $125 million in incremental sales and $0.08 of earnings per diluted share to the fourth quarter and the full year last year.","Finally, our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.1% for the second quarter and 37.8% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 224.9 million shares for the second quarter and 225 million shares for the full year. While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase.","With this in mind, for the second quarter of 2013, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.81 billion to $1.86 billion based on a low single-digit comparable store sales increase and 7.1% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.57.","The company reported second quarter 2012 earnings per share of $0.51, which included a previously disclosed onetime benefit to earnings from a favorable tax rate amounting to about $0.025 per share. Our earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2013 represents an increase of 6% to 16% over last year earnings per share when excluding the onetime tax benefit.","For the full fiscal year of 2013, we are now forecasting sales in the range of $7.81 billion to $7.97 billion based on a low single-digit increase in comparable store sales and 7.3% square footage growth.","Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $2.61 to $2.77. This represents an increase of 7% to 14% over 2012 earnings per share of $2.44, excluding the $0.08 benefit from the 53rd week and the $0.16 gain from the sale of Ollie's in the third quarter of last year.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Kevin. Once again, I'm very pleased with our company's performance in first quarter and we're solidly on track to accomplish our goals for 2013.","Total sales grew 8.3% to $1.87 billion, a first quarter record. Operating margin increased by 70 basis points, also, the very best first quarter in our history. And earnings per share increased by 18% to $0.59 per share, another first quarter record.","We continue to grow, opening 94 new stores. We expanded and relocated 16 stores and increased our selling square footage by 7%. And our new store productivity continues to increase. We expanded frozen and refrigerated product to 229 stores, more than any previous quarter in our history.","To support our growth, we completed the construction of a new 1 million square foot DC in Windsor, Connecticut, increased our capacity in San Bernardino, California, and broke ground on the expansion of our Marietta, Oklahoma, DC. And we continue to manage our capital for the benefit of long-term shareholders.","Over the past 4 quarters, we've invested more than $400 million for share repurchases, including $68 million in the first quarter this year.","As I look ahead, I believe that Dollar Tree values have never been better and our future has never been brighter. We have a vision of where we want to go and the infrastructure and capital to make it happen. We're opening new Dollar Tree stores, and there's plenty of room to grow.","We're increasing the productivity of our stores, in both new stores and comp stores. We're growing through new formats like Deal$ and Dollar Tree Direct, and we're expanding our geographic reach. Canada is a great opportunity for substantial growth. All of this provides a roadmap for sustained profitable growth ahead.","We will now address your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Matt Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you update us on your view for the health of the low-end consumer, particularly do you believe we're seeing any initial signs of underlying improvement after the fiscal cliff uncertainty? And you talked to improvement in April. Have you seen this continue into May? And what are the drivers of the improvement in the back half of the quarter?","Bob Sasser","Well, starting with the consumer, just anecdotally, I can tell you that we still think they're concerned and burdened, and I would add, just a bit weary from all that's going on. They're now facing higher taxes, meaning overall less money to spend. And add to that the job concerns that are still there and the uncertainty around the economy, and the gas prices are down a little bit, but they're still high. They're stubbornly high. So the consumer is under pressure. At Dollar Tree, again, we think of ourselves as a part of the solution and a destination for those customers. When you're cash-strapped, you can come to Dollar Tree to balance your budget. We got things you need, things you want, exciting place to shop, everything is still $1. So we think our stores and our merchandise assortment is more relevant than ever. The other part of your question spoke to what's driving our business. In my earlier remarks, we talked about stationery and party and HBC and all of those things. We had great seasonal. Valentine's Day was a terrific event for us, as it generally is. Easter was a big holiday, although early. We had a nice sell-through on our Easter business. The sales were driven by a balanced mix, basically, between comps and average ticket in the first quarter. So -- and we were comp positive all 3 periods of the first quarter, February, March and April, with April being the best comp of the first quarter.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then second, can you elaborate on your gross margin performance in the quarter? Particularly, you spoke to the IMU benefit. Is this something you're seeing from a sourcing perspective? As we look forward, how should we think about it in the back half of the year?","Kevin S. Wampler","Well, Matt, I think, as we look at it, we've talked about higher IMU in many categories for a while now. So this is, in my opinion, is just the continuation of our merchants continuing to source just unbelievable values out there to help our consumer along. So I don't think that's anything necessarily different. I think what changed a little bit was, obviously, the mix changed a little bit from an overall consumable and discretionary. As Bob noted in his comments, discretionary grew faster than consumables, which is the first time we've seen that in a while. And we think that's a good thing. We are a general merchandise variety store. It's where our heritage is. It's where we kind of -- where our roots are. And at the end of the day, that's a good place to be. So we continue to focus there and believe that can be important for us. As we look to the year, we'll continue that way. We think that -- we think the trend, our guidance as we look to Q2 takes some of that trend into consideration in the sense that we think our discretionary business will continue to be -- do well. That doesn't mean we're trying to sell less consumables. So at the end of the day, we're still -- we have plenty of consumables and we'll continue to try to grow that business as well.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on what Matt was referencing, and on the discretionary side. Maybe can you expand on some of the, or at least quantify some of the SKU additions there and maybe how that's helped the comp?","Bob Sasser","Well, in first quarter, we had a terrific seasonal set. Again, Valentine's Day, a terrific comp on our Valentine's Day this year. Our balloon business, our party business, all of the seasonal needs that go with Valentine, our candy business, we did very well. Our customers, even with the early Easter and the really cold weather around Easter, they responded favorably to our Easter assortments, and we had a nice sell-through on that. And then we came in after Easter, like the day after, and our stores and our merchants and our distribution team did a terrific job of really falling in there the day after Easter on the first and setting up for Spring Fling, which is sort of a new promotion that we plugged in because Easter was so early. And it's -- by Easter being early, it makes you farther from Mother's Day. So we took that opportunity and they put in Spring Fling. And Spring Fling was all the things you needed for spring, and it was colorful and exciting and variety, a mix of variety of consumable products that our customers really responded well to. So that drove sales in April. That drove sales, drove margin in the quarter, and really got us off to a good start for second quarter.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe changing gears. Last year, you had noted Canada was still in the midst of a transition and was weighing on sales and margins. Can you maybe update us on the contribution from that region?","Bob Sasser","Canada still was -- cost us probably $0.01 in the quarter. For the year, we think it could be breakeven this year. We're making great progress. We love our stores, our customers like what they're seeing. We're re-branding still. We're finishing up by the end of third quarter re-branding the West. Ontario is completely re-branded to Dollar Tree Canada and relayed with new layouts and new merchandise. The West is underway right now, but we do have the infrastructure in place. We've got the technology, the system, the processes. Our buyers are leveraging the power of the Dollar Tree pencil. We're adding in things from the Canadian market that are relevant to the Canadian market and the Canadian stores. And we're having great success in that product. So the customers are responding favorably. We're excited about our business in Canada.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Historically, Dollar Tree needed about a 2% same store sales gain to maintain a flat expense rate, just reflecting the inflationary pressures of running the business. This quarter, the expenses per store actually dropped about 1%. Can you -- maybe a question for Kevin. Can you talk about, on the expense savings, what's sustainable and what's not going forward?","Kevin S. Wampler","Sure. I think we did have great performance here in Q1, a lot of people focused on expense control. And you guys have heard me speak to expenses before in the sense that we think about it at the line item detail. We get down pretty deep in the weeds in looking at them and, basically, thinking about how we can improve them either through process or through looking at different suppliers and bidding things out and things like that. I would tell you that on the SG&A side, I believe I said last year at one point that at a 2% comp, I thought we could get a little leverage on SG&A. And I think that's still probably true if we can control things the way we're going forward. Would I expect 50 basis points? Not necessarily. That's a little bit better performance than even I would expect. But we think we run our business pretty well. We're very focused on those types of things. When you sell things for $1, obviously, your expense structure is very important. We have a lot of people -- initiatives around that and people focused on it. So I think in general, that we think we can continue to leverage expenses but I don't know that it will always be to this extent at a 2% comp.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Bob, one question for you. Last night, there were more headlines out of China about slowing manufacturing. Is this in any way positive for Dollar Tree, to the extent that your manufacturers of your private label products may have excess capacity and they're looking to do more business with a growth company like Dollar Tree?","Bob Sasser","Dan, they are and they have been. And again, the most recent trip in April -- April trip is not the largest buying trip, it that takes us through buying in first quarter or pretty much through first quarter. But the market in China for Dollar Tree and for someone with the reputation and the capital and the cash and open to buy is really good. We've got -- we have good relationships that we continue to leverage. Our values, seriously, have never been higher on our product, and our margins are better. So those are 2 milestone points to point to that say that the environment in China is positive for our kind of business. And it has been. I've been saying that for quite some time. But a lot of it has to do with our presence there, the fact that we put down orders and we pay our bills and we buy lots of product and we have a history of doing that. And some of it is the fact that business has slowed down a little in China and they're looking for more people like Dollar Tree out there in the market.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Question on the discretionary growing faster than consumables. Can you give us the percentage change in consumables relative to the total mix? And then can you talk about that in light of the continued rollout of coolers? And you actually announced an acceleration of that cooler rollout this morning. Is there any concern that the coolers and the other consumables component is now driving less traffic than it used to in the past? Or is there some other dynamic going on?","Bob Sasser","A couple of things I'll share with you, just a little color and anecdotal. First of all, I think the share of mix variety increased about 40 bps in the quarter, something like that. The -- just a little color on that, too. If you look back at first quarter last year, first of all, our consumable business grew much faster. I think it was the highest increase in penetration that we'd had last year. So our consumable business was up against a big bar last year. Now we did a great first quarter this year, too. So we grew it again, we grew our variety business faster. That's one thing. The second thing is, this wasn't an accident. We started last year talking about driving more variety business, talking about driving our stationery business, driving our party business, driving -- changing and remodeling and redoing and re-merchandising our front-ends with margin and with season and with color and excitement and new. And with our July buying trip last year, a lot of focus was put on that by our buyers. And I think what you see, and I know what you see in the first quarter, is the evidence of a better Valentine promotion, a better Easter promotion. We were sort of scared because of the early Easter, and we doubled down as we always do, and we had a better Easter assortment, alongside a better stationery assortment, expanded assortment in our variety category. So it wasn't an accident. We planned it and, by gosh if it didn't work. We had terrific response from the customers in a tough quarter, and I don't say this -- no weather reports here -- but in a tough quarter that we all knew was tough, the calendar was against us and then the weather was cold and rainy and ugly and snowstorms and all that. But in a tough quarter, we really drove terrific sales on our variety product, and it's because of the value of that product. And so there's the difference. We still are committed to our consumable business. We're going to give our customers what they want, more of what they want, we're going to drive that part of the business, too. Our freezer stores are still very important to us. And I would say that the freezer store increases have been much like the history of our freezer store increases. Not much has changed there. We're excited about it. We rolled out 229 new frozen and refrigerated stores in the first quarter. We've increased the number that we're going to roll out for the year. We are committed to that program, and we like the results. We like what it does in sales, we like what it does in traffic, and we like what it does in raising the sale of our variety merchandise also.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Bob, could you give us an update on the Deal$ format? What's the opportunity there long term? How are traffic margins and returns relative to the Dollar Tree format? And then just maybe a general just kind of updated view on multi-price points overall. One of your top competitors in Canada a few years back rolled out multi-price points. And just what's your updated thoughts on any test or integration into Dollar Tree, whether in the U.S. or Canada down the line?","Bob Sasser","Paul, thank you for the question. The -- we have a very clear strategy. Dollar Tree is everything is $1. And in Deal$, we've lifted the restriction to price points to offer more variety, more value and serve more customers. And that is the direction that we're headed. We are, in Dollar Tree, very pure. We believe in that model, I mean, for gosh -- it's the best thing -- the best investment we have is to open a new Dollar Tree store. Customers love it. Everything is $1, that's what sets us apart from others in the market. And we've done a pretty good job of understanding how to run that and roll that out. A lot of room to grow on the Dollar Tree side. Deal$, lifting the restriction, we have a terrific opportunity here to grow that model. We have about 200 stores. If you want, I can give you some color on the Deal$ concept. It's more consumables, about 60-40 consumable to variety. It's a higher consumable business. We believe long haul, it's going to be a large -- a higher volume business. Maybe at a slightly lower margin rate, but we think we get to the finish line just as well with the new Deal$ model. We opened 8 new stores in the first quarter. To give you a little more color on the business, top categories at Deal$ were stationery, lawn and garden, home decor and electronics. I'm not sure this is a good thing, but the extended winter in the first quarter drove a lot of sales of hats and gloves and scarves and thermals and that type of apparel. Average ticket at Deal$ stores was $9.74 for the quarter, that's higher than our Dollar Tree stores as you know. Our average ticket when they bought something that was over $1 was $15.23, that's an increase from first quarter last year. And again, that's one of the things that we like about the Deal$ model, it gives us a chance to drive that average ticket. It's almost double what the Dollar Tree is. Transactions when we have higher than $1 price point item in the basket, total was 48.9% of the transactions this year. That's up from first quarter last year. Our average unit retail for the higher than $1 price is $3.15. That also is higher than first quarter last year. And sales of merchandise over $1 was 39% of our sales for all of our Deal$ stores in the first quarter, again, that was up also. So 60-40 consumable to variety. A little bit different way of getting to the model. We think especially in high, densely populated, high-cost markets, that this is a model that we can leverage fixed costs better, with the higher volumes. And that's why you see a lot of Deal$ stores opening up in the Northeast and in some of those type markets. It was a good quarter for Deal$. I appreciate your question, appreciate you giving me the chance to talk about that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about where you are in the addition of more merchandise in the front of the store, and what have the early results been thus far?","Bob Sasser","Well, we re-merchandised, right after Easter, we re-merchandised all of our checkout lanes. It's the most, biggest overhaul we've ever done upfront, almost all new merchandise. We lowered the profile upfront. You can walk up now, and you can see the cashier and the cashier can see you as a customer. We wanted to make the front-end, which is the last thing they see in our store, more inviting. We also wanted to make it a place where we could sell more impulse product. We wanted to give our cashiers a chance to engage the customer, better speak to them, talk to them, maybe even point out a new item that we had. So that was all done right after Easter this year, in April. And the new assortment is out there. Customer response has been terrific. It's doing all of those things that I just said, frankly. It's early in the year, but it is accomplishing all the things that we talked about. So I'm really pleased with that. Merchandise margin is good on the front-end, it's a better shopping experience, and helping us drive some of that variety sales.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then also can you just give some idea of how much incremental spend you're making in Canada? Is there an expense layer that goes away, or is it simply a matter of kind of ramping up the productivity of those stores?","Kevin S. Wampler","So I would say from an expense perspective, we made those investments over the last couple years. There were systems that needed to be put into place. There was structure around the store teams, as well as training for the store teams. And then there was, basically, investment, to a small extent, around our third-party DCs. So that basically has been pretty much taken care of and is embedded in the P&L at the end of the day. Obviously, from a productivity story, we do need to become more productive up there, and it's something that they're very focused on. And as we've talked about, the assortment of goods continues to get better with each buying trip, being able to leverage what Dollar Tree brings from an import perspective, as well as making sure that we're addressing the Canadian needs at the end of the day. For the fact that it is, as we'd like to say, it's not a 51st state. It is it's own country and you need to respect that accordingly. So I think that's kind of where we sit at the moment.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Trisha Dill with Wells Fargo Securities.","Trisha Dill - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So just given the better performance of the discretionary business this quarter and some of the changes you made to the front of the store, are you planning on even more SKU expansion in the back half in some of those categories like stationery and candy? And then maybe as a follow-up, can you just talk about some of the other changes to the stores that you have planned for the back half?","Bob Sasser","We've done a lot of the changes, the major changes, for the year. We're always changing something, but the whole front end was changed right after Easter this year. That's going to be -- I expect good returns from that for the rest of the year. Our stationery business is one that we placed a high priority on and a lot of importance. We've expanded that, probably, I'm saying 75 SKUs right now. We think that -- you're always dropping and adding and you're moving things around, but we've expanded the space to our stationery department. We've expanded the SKUs to our stationery department. We really have gone after some of the things like writing instruments and binders in our office supplies, and that's going to be solid for the rest of the year, especially once we get into the back-to-school season. So we're going to see -- we're seeing good response to it, now. Our stationery business is growing faster than most of the rest of the company and the margins are terrific. Our party business is one that we've expanded. Right now, as we go into graduation, we are better positioned for graduation than we have ever been. We have taken a position in our party to offer more things for the graduate. We have the balloons and we have all the party supplies and all the things you need to celebrate that graduation. And the most exciting part of that is the solid color program. So no matter where you live, no matter what high school or what place you graduate from, we're going to have your school colors. And actually, you can go onto our website and you can look and you can see and you can look for your school colors, and then you can put in your zip code and it tells you exactly which store to go to. So all you got to do is grab the car keys and out the door and to the store to buy those solid school colors for your party for that graduate. So a lot of emphasis on our party. Upcoming, you haven't seen a whole lot of it yet because the weather has been kind of not summer, but our toy department has been redesigned, reflagged, and I'm looking for that to just gain traction throughout the year. We do need a little warm weather to go to the beach. Hoping that this weekend with Memorial Day, that all of that changes and people are out at the beach and having a good time around the pools and the barbecues and that. If so, they're going to find great product in our toy department, glow sticks and everything to celebrate Memorial Day. But as we go through the year and on into fourth quarter, I think our toy business, as part of our variety offering, I can tell you we haven't gotten to the selling season yet, but I've seen the merchandise, and it's new and it's fresh and basically didn't start over completely but almost completely re- -- overhauled the toy department. So I'm looking for big things, continuing opportunities out of that part of the business.","Operator","We have time for a couple more questions. Our next question comes from David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","With gross margin up for the last couple of quarters and discretionary doing better, Kevin, can you talk about, a little bit about the outlook for gross margin? I mean, are we at a point where this historical range between 35% and 36% maybe starts getting broke and you go above 36%?","Kevin S. Wampler","You've been following us for a long time, David, and as you said, we've got this consistency in gross margin but there's a reason for that. Obviously, during times of deflation, we don't -- we put that money back into the product. We think that's really important, the value to the consumer, the wow items that we're able to provide. And that's part of the story behind why that is so consistent. Obviously, within that 10-year period of time, we've obviously had the growth of consumables. But as we went through the years, we've actually gotten better with that as well, and the margins have come up in that business as well for us on an overall basis. So I don't expect it to go significantly higher, to break out of that range necessarily. I do think that we're always looking at it, and we believe we're in control of our margin and what we sell in our stores. And that's a part of the way we've always looked at it, that's the way we build out our guidance. But I would not expect it to break out substantially above that at this point.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","But we could see gross margins continue to improve year-over-year as the year goes on?","Kevin S. Wampler","I think that would be a good thing. I don't know that we've necessarily modeled a lot of improvement in there at the end of the day. But I think, as I said, just because discretionary is a little better this quarter, it's not like we're not trying to sell a lot of consumables as well. So that could switch back, that could kind of flip back over the year, so we'll just have to see how it goes. Although we do have some great initiatives in the discretionary area.","Bob Sasser","David, it's all driven by the consumer. You've heard me say this before, but we're here to sell them what they want. And when they want to buy more of the fast turning, lower margin consumer products, then we're there with them to offer that. And at the same time, we're always trying to make our stores more interesting and more fun, and that variety merchandise and seasonal product is how we do that. As far as -- Kevin got it exactly right, is we don't change the price, we change the product. And we offer more value over less value, but that gross profit, when prices are down, we're likely to invest back into the product to offer more value and drive the top line.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joan Storms with Wedbush.","Joan L. Bogucki-Storms - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions with regards to the comps. You got all these coolers that you're opening up earlier this year, plus stores and then plus the discretionary is doing pretty well. Do you think in the back half, it seems pretty conservative to be looking at -- still guiding for 3% or 4% or whatever, a low single-digit comp for the year.","Bob Sasser","Well, I hope you're right, Joan. We're certainly doing everything we can, again, to drive the top line at the margins that deliver the most return for our shareholders. So we're going -- we're not holding back. We're going to keep pushing forward on that. And as I said earlier, we really believe in this consumer products business, and our customers have voted for more coolers in the market, so we're going to install more and we're going to drive more sales there. The -- what I'd like to see and what we have seen is that as we drive more traffic with that, more frequency of shoppers [indiscernible] our merchandise assortments and our variety assortments. And we've redone our front-end, we've redone our core, our middle of the store with stationery and toys and all that. So I hope that as we drive more consumer business, we'll also drive more variety business. That's how -- that's the magic.","Joan L. Bogucki-Storms - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, you're investing a lot in 3 DCs this year. What's the outlook sort of beyond this year with those big investments done? You've got a couple of years where you're going to drive some incremental cash flow on lower CapEx, say, in 2014 and 2015?","Kevin S. Wampler","Yes, Joan, I would tell you that this is the first new DC we've brought out of the ground since, I believe, 2004, that wasn't a replacement for another existing facility. So we built out the network in the mid-2000s to be able to go across the country. And over the last few years, we have basically continued to grow and basically continued to get more efficient in those DCs. We are at the point now where, given the number of stores we're adding, we're pushing to get as much efficiency as we can out of these buildings, but we may need to start adding them a little more frequently. It's likely to not be another 8 years before we had another DC at the end of the day. So I think if we would look out 3 years, is there likely to be another DC at some point? Yes, I believe there will be. But we'll continue to look and see what we can do with our existing DCs. We'd like to expand them as well. The one in Marietta that we're expanding is going to 1 million square feet, and those big buildings are really efficient when you can run thousands and thousands of cartons through them at the end of the day. So we continue to make sure we basically take the network and make it as efficient as possible.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","On the -- Bob, you mentioned the re-merchandising at the front end and the additional impulse items and whatnot, but I was thinking that was more -- the impulse initiative was more of a late fall 2012 thing. Are you doing something differently there now? Have you changed the focus? Have you added new merchandise? If you could give us a little more color on that?","Bob Sasser","Yes, we have. And your memory serves you well. 2012, at the end of 2012, we started installing new fixtures in our new stores and we started re-assorting the front ends, basically using product that we had in the stores. And from the existing mix, we were putting a peg hook of this and a peg hook of that, and we were sort of finding our way with what should be on those front ends, at the same time, beginning to buy for a new program. And that's what I was talking about, that we rolled out right after Easter. We started back in fourth quarter re-merchandising with existing product and buying, actually back in July of last year, new merchandise for the front ends. We added a trend fixture to the front. A trend fixture is ever-changing, it's new product, it's fun product, it's impulse product. Some of it's kiddie candy, some of it is stationery, some of it is from toys, some of it's from all over the store. But it's trending and it's new and it's fresh and it really engages the customer and invites them to buy one more item to put in their basket. Then the new checkout assortment that we have, everything has a home on the checkout. We've bought for it, it's all new merchandise, it's not the same SKUs, it's new product. Some of it is similar, but it's all new. And it's laid out in a fashion that's easier to shop and more engaging. We have made a spot on our checkouts now for our drive item, which is the item that our cashiers are selling to our customers or suggesting to our customers each week. And we've done drive item for a while, now we have a place for it, and we have a program. We have a flow of product for the drive items. And it's enabling us to better train and coach and counsel and really get that program up and running. So a lot of changes, a lot of new product. It was almost entirely new product that we put on these checkouts right after Easter this year.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","So if you look at your average ticket over the years, I mean, it just -- it hasn't changed much, right? It's what, $9 or so?","Kevin S. Wampler","Not quite.","Bob Sasser","$8.87 or something like that.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And how long has it been at that level?","Bob Sasser","It goes up each year a little bit. You're right, it's stubborn. It goes up -- a couple percent is a big idea.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","I mean, where do you think you can get -- do you think that -- first of all, do you think the impulse initiative will drive the average ticket higher? And where do you think the average ticket can go over the next several years?","Bob Sasser","Absolutely, the impulse initiative would drive the average ticket higher. All the things that we do at the front-end of our stores, all the things that we do with our end caps. When we build our end caps, it's basically suggestive selling. Customers know the price, everything is $1. So we always work on putting one more item in their basket on the end caps, last minute at the checkouts, drive item suggestion selling. So it's always a work in progress, Patrick. Our price point is always going to make it stubborn. It's always going to -- we always want to have a combination of increased traffic and increased average ticket to drive our business. And so if you look back at the history, you'll see it's gone up year-over-year. Back 10 years ago in the little mall stores, I think it was $5 in those stores. So we've come a long way from 10 years ago. I don't know that it will be $5 higher in the next 10 years, but -- or $3 higher, but certainly, it's an opportunity for us to continue to drive more sales, to drive more interest, more fun. People shop Dollar Tree because they like shopping Dollar Tree, and that's all part of it, is this idea of suggestive selling and impulse. And everywhere I look, there's another challenge to buy something.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

Please go ahead, sir.","Randy Guiler","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the first fiscal quarter 2018. Participating on today's call will be our President and CEO, Gary Philbin; and our CFO, Kevin Wampler.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors.

Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up if necessary.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gary Philbin, Dollar Tree's President and Chief Executive Officer.","Gary Philbin","Thanks, Randy, and good morning everyone. Thanks for your patience. This morning, we announced our results for our first quarter of fiscal 2018. Sales increased 5% to $5.55 billion. Our consolidated same-store sales increased 1.4%. By segment, comp sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 4%, and for the Family Dollar banner, comp sales decreased 1.1%. Our enterprise gross margin rate declined 20 basis points to 30.6%. Operating income increased 12.6% to $437.6 million. And excluding costs associated with our recent refinancing and the prior year's $50.9 million receivable impairment, adjusted earnings per share increased 21.4% to $1.19.","Our teams in both banners worked hard to deliver top line sales and bottom line results that were within our guidance range for the quarter when adjusted for the debt refinancing. We started the year knowing we needed to overcome an early Easter. Our teams faced some significant hurdles and freight cost pressure above our initial estimates in the quarter, and the disruption of business, especially at Family Dollar from a wetter and cooler-than-expected spring. Faced with these issues, I'm proud of our banners and teams' efforts to overcome these hurdles.","By our business segments, for Dollar Tree, we had a positive quarter of 4% comp, now the fourth consecutive quarter of comps greater than 3.5%. Family Dollar comps, while negative, had positive consumable comps, now the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comps for the consumables side of our business. Our Dollar Tree Canada team exceeded its plan for operating income driven by improved margins and expense leverage, and our Dollar Tree Direct online business delivered double-digit comp increases in both sales and side business.","In our Dollar Tree banner for the first quarter, our top performing categories were candy, snacks and beverage, beauty and eyewear, health and personal care, and household consumables. Our sales performance was very balanced with discretionary slightly outperforming consumables.","February same-store sales were in line with the comp for the quarter. March was a strong positive, and April was down year-over-year as expected; both March and April comps were affected by the earlier Easter, April 1st this year, compared to April 16th last year. Geographically, Dollar Tree same-store sales growth was strongest in the Southwest and Southeast, and all of our zones delivered positive comps at or greater than 3%. We're really pleased with the Dollar Tree banner's comp store sales results in a quarter that had the disruption of winter storms, an early Easter, and in a spring's weather's arrival that seemed later than most years. Our 4% comp was a remarkable result from all of our store teams and our merchants.","Our merchant teams again hit the mark on incredible values and assortment. We asked them to make up for an early Easter, and we moved the needle across both our discretionary and consumable categories. Over the past year, the Dollar Tree merchant team has developed and tested an initiative for select stores, which we call Snack Zone. The Snack Zone is designed to provide customers with a compelling assortment of immediate consumption products at the dollar price point to drive incremental sales. Our customers are excited with the introduction of the Snack Zone, great values across categories of cold beverages, candy, snack cake, salty treats, other favorites that bring our customers back to those treats that they crave. We're excited about these incremental sales and additional foot traffic that they generate in the stores we're installed. During Q1, we added the Snack Zone to 214 Dollar Tree stores, and have plans to launch this initiative into 750 Dollar Tree stores in fiscal 2018. ","For the Family Dollar banner in the first quarter, though we did not achieve our intended target on comps for the quarter, we continue to make progress around our assortment, marketing, and store renovation program. Our pressure on comps was nearly all due to misses in apparel and lawn and garden, our two departments that got off to a slow start with the colder-than-normal-spring and early Easter. However, the following highlights continue to show strength in the underlying business. Top performing categories includes refrigerated and frozen food, school and office supply, snacks and beverage. Our comp performance was again driven by consumables. I'm pleased with our progress across these categories as it speaks to the relevance and items that our customers need most, and count on Family Dollar to deliver weekly.","Our sales cadence through the quarter, comp sales were strongest in March, and softest in April, as expected, with the impact of the Easter holiday timing shift. Geographically, Family Dollar same-store sales for the quarter was strongest in our Northeast and West zones. We also worked during the quarter to reset and highlight beauty care. It's an important category for our primary loyal customer and has been very well received. And we've seen strong comps in the stores completed. Our expanded assortment has turned this category positive dramatically in March and April despite the Easter shift and cooler temperatures.","Our increased inventory levels of family dollar represent our measured investment of additional inventory in key departments to drive better end stocks along with the timing of several resets that were in motion. We expect this to decline over the year from current levels. Our customer-facing program to refresh our value message at Family Dollar is Smart Ways to Save, whether you visit a Family Dollar store, view a marketing circular or check our Web site you will see a consistent value messaging. It's all across our Smart Ways to Save. EDLP pricing for everyday value, price drops that reflect meaningful value on promotional items, our $1 Wow items which drives surprise value in an opening price point across our stores, and Compare and Save calls on great values on our private brands. And our Smart Coupon program supports us with our messaging.","During the quarter, we had more than 900,000 new customers sign up for Smart Coupons, now bringing our total enrollment to over six million since the program was launched chain-wide in 2016. The Family Dollar mobile app makes it easier for customers to use Smart Coupons; 2.9 million customers now have downloaded the app, and we are receiving strong reviews on both Android and Apple operating systems. We continue to gain traction on the new private brands that we've been introducing across the chain. These brands have been developed to provide national brand comparable quality and meaningful savings to support the Compare and Save component of our Smart Ways to Save program. Our customers know they can count on the quality with our 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.","We've completed the rollout of new brands in the consumables category and are well underway with changes being made in our apparel and home categories, which should be completed by the end of Q2. These brands provide customers an alternative, but even greater values. Our goal is to drive traffic and loyalty while enhancing profit margins.","During the first quarter, we completed another 215 Family Dollar store renovations, bringing our total to 592. We continue to be very pleased with the initial results we are seeing in these newly renovated stores, and especially about the feedback we are receiving from our customers and store teams. The renovated stores provide our customers with a better Family Dollar shopping experience. Better shopping adjacencies and more productive meaningful end caps, expanded beverage and snacks, including immediate consumption [quarters] [ph] near checkout, added assortment of food in coolers and freezers, updated hair care assortment, expanded adult beverage in select stores, a shopper-friendly power alley to emphasize $1 Wow items, and a faster checkout process for the customer.","Our store teams are working hard to be the neighborhood store of choice for the fill-in shopping needs of our Family Dollar customers that typically live, work, and shop near our stores.","Highlight for the quarter at Dollar Tree Canada include the team delivered mid-to-single digit positive comps for the quarter. We saw increases in both ticket and traffic. April was the softest month of the quarter due to the earlier Easter. Both discretionary and consumables comp better than 4% for the quarter. Top performing categories included law and garden, floral, and kitchen textiles. And the operating income was slightly ahead of plan driven by the margins and overall SG&A leverage. Our focus on our people, retention and building on operational leadership capability continue to be our fundamental to driving solid results in Canada.","Dollar Tree Direct is our selling Web site for the Dollar Tree banner, which provides opportunities for enhancing our customer base, driving incremental sales, extending brand awareness, and then encouraging in-store visits. Q1 represent another productive and profitable quarter for Dollar Tree Direct with double-digit increases in both sales and Web site traffic, conversion rates increased for both desktop and mobile during the quarter. Our online videos earn more than 1.6 million views during the quarter highlighted by our new seasonal prize videos associated with Easter, and highlighting our expanded assortment of frozen foods.","In Q1, our e-mail subscriber database exceeded 3.4 million customers they have opted in. Our e-mail subscribers are brand loyal, and are excited to be the first to know of great value since selections we offer every week. Our Q1 marketing was heavily focused on spring, Easter, and early summer with the goal of driving both in-store traffic and online sales. Check out both Web site at dollartree.com and familydollar.com.","Looking at real estate for the first quarter, we opened a total of 130 new stores, 68 Dollar Trees, 62 Family Dollars, we relocate or expanded 26 stores, 24 Dollar Trees and two Family Dollars, and we renovated 215 Family Dollar stores as part of the renovation initiative for a total of 371 projects during the quarter. We also added freezers and coolers into our 104 Dollar Tree stores during the first quarter, bringing our total of Dollar Tree stores with freezers in course to 5,311 stores. During the quarter, we closed five stores, two Dollar Trees and three Family Dollars, and we ended the quarter with 14,957 stores; 6,716 of them being Dollar Trees, 8,241 Family Dollars.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our first quarter performance and our outlook for Q2 and fiscal 2018. Kevin?","Kevin Wampler","Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Total sales for the first quarter grew 5% to $5.55 billion within our guidance range of $5.53 billion to $5.63 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 8.3% to $2.78 billion, and Family Dollar segment total sales increased 2% to $2.77 billion. Enterprise same-store sales increased 1.4%. On a segment basis, same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 4% or 4.1% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations, and the Family Dollar banner decreased 1.1%.","Overall gross profit increased 4.5% to $1.7 billion for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the prior year's quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin declined 20 basis points to 30.6% versus 30.8% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.5% for the first quarter, a 40 basis point decline compared with the prior year's first quarter. Factors impacting the segments gross margin performance during the quarter included shrink costs, which increased 30 basis points, merchandise cost, including freight increased 20 basis points due to higher freight costs partially offset by increased sales of higher margin variety items.","Distribution costs increased 15 basis points, primarily from higher distribution center payroll costs. And these are partially offset by occupancy costs, which decreased 20 basis points resulting from leverage from the comparable store sales increase in the quarter.","Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 26.7% during the first quarter, compared with 26.9% in the comparable prior year period. The 20 basis point decline was primarily due to occupancy costs, which increased 45 basis points due to loss of leverage from the decrease in comparable store sales, shrink costs, which increased 30 basis points, and distribution costs increased 10 basis points due to higher distribution center payroll costs. These were partially offset by markdowns, which decreased 40 basis points resulting from fewer promotional markdowns and merchandise cost, including freight decreased 30 basis points resulting from higher initial mark-on partially offset by increased freight costs.","Consolidated selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter improved 70 basis points to 22.7% from 23.4% in the same quarter last year. Excluding the $5.9 million receivable impairment from the prior year's quarter, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased to 20 basis points from an adjusted 22.5% in the prior year's quarter. The increase was driven by higher store payroll cost partially offset by lower depreciation.","First quarter SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales was consistent with the prior year at 22.6%. Store hourly payroll cost increased 30 basis points related to our Tax Cut and Jobs Act savings reinvestment plan. This increase was offset by lower depreciation in utility cost.","SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 22.8%, compared to 24.2% in the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $50.9 million receivable impairment from the prior year, Family Dollar SG&A as a percentage of sales increased to 50 basis points. The increase was a result of 65 basis points increase in store hourly payroll expense that was slightly offset by lower depreciation expense.","Operating income for the enterprise increased to $437.6 million, compared with $388.8 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin improved 50 basis points to 7.9% for the quarter from 7.4% in last year's first quarter. Excluding the previously-mentioned receivable impairment to prior year, quarter adjusted operating margin was 8.3%.","Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 40 basis points to 11.9% when compared to the prior year quarter. And operating income for the Family Dollar segment increased $34 million to $107.4 million. Excluding the prior year receivable impairment, operating income decreased 70 basis points to 3.9%.","Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $230.2 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense and cost associated with the recent refinancing of the company's debt. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, compared to 36.1% in the prior year period. The lower rate is a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which lowered the federal rate to 21% from 35% in the prior year.","For the first quarter, the company had net income of $160.5 billion or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to the prior year net income of $200.5 million or $0.85 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. This year's Q1 included $0.52 of cost associated with our debt refinancing, and last year's Q1 reported earnings included $0.13 receivable impairment charge. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS grew 21.4% to a $1.19 from an adjusted $0.98 per share in the prior year's quarter. Today's press release includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures for details on the adjustments.","Combined, cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end totaled $475.2 million, compared to $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Our outstanding debt as of May 5, 2018, was approximately $5 billion, a decrease of $123 million from a year ago. During the quarter, the company entered into a new credit agreement consisting of a $1.25 billion revolver and a $782 million term loan facility. Additionally on April 19, the company completed the registered offering of $4 billion in several tranches of investment grade notes. The company used to proceed to repay its acquisition notes.","Connection with the refinancing, the company paid $114.3 million of prepayment fees, expensed 41.6 million in unamortized non-cash deferred financing cost, and incurred a net $4.6 million of interest on the new notes prior to the repayment of the acquisition notes. These one-time costs as detailed in the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and sales earnings release reduced GAAP EPS for Q1 by $0.52 per diluted share. The company expects to save approximately $48 million in annual interest expense going forward. The interest savings for Q2 to Q4 fiscal 2008 will equate to approximately $0.13 of earnings per share.","Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter-end increased 7.9% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 4.3%. Inventory for selling square foot increased 3.4%. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the second quarter.","Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter-end increased 16.9% from the same period last year and increased 14% on a selling square foot basis. At quarter-end last year, inventory was down 3% total and 4.2% on a selling square foot basis. The increase levels in the current year represent our continued work to support in stock levels as well as the inventory for several category resets.","Capital expenditures were $180.9 million in the first quarter versus $110.3 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2018, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $875 million to $890 million consistent with our initial 2018 outlook.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $151.6 million for the first quarter and $153.9 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2018, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $610 million to $620 million.","Our updated outlook for fiscal 2018 includes the following assumptions. Calendar considerations for the year include the following: 2018 is a 52-week year, the 53rd-week in Q4 of 2017 added $406.6 million of sales, and approximately $0.21 to earnings per share. Halloween shifts from Q4 into Q3 in 2018. We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on state's increasing minimum wages. Additionally, as previously discussed, we continue to invest on store hours and average hourly wage rates as part of our $100 million investment into our business from our projected $250 million tax benefit. We expect higher freight and diesel costs to continue. These costs are trending higher than our original guidance, and we reflected that in our updated outlook. We will continue to work to mitigate these increases as we go forward.","Net interest expense will be approximately $47 million for Q2 through Q4. Our guidance does not include any share repurchases. We cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We've not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 19.8% for the second quarter and 22.2% for fiscal 2018. And weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 238.7 million shares for Q2 and 238.9 million shares for the full-year. For the second quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.47 billion to $5.57 billion, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.16. These estimates are based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year square footage growth of 3.3%.","For fiscal 2018, we are now forecasting total sales to range between $22.73 billion and $23.05 billion based on a low single-digit same-store sales increase and 3.7% square footage growth. The company now anticipates net income for diluted share for full fiscal 2018 will range between $4.80 and $5.10, compared to the company's previously-expected range of 525 to 560.","The updated annual guidance range includes the following factors: $0.52 per share of one-time cost associated with the company's first quarter debt refinancing, $0.13 per share of benefit related to expected interest expense savings from the refinancing, $0.04 per share of benefit for an expected reduction in the second quarter corporate tax rate and $0.09 per share of expected cost from continued pressure related to freight and shrink expense.","I will now turn the call back to Gary.","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Kevin. We continue to focus on and make meaningful progress to grow and improve our business for both banners. Now we are well-positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increased value for our long-term shareholders. The combination of nearly 15,000 Dollar Trees and Family Dollar stores provides us the opportunity to serve more customers in all types of markets. The combination of these two great brands provides great flexibility in managing our future.","Now, to the timing shift of the holiday and colder-than-normal-spring weather behind us, we have seen a pick-up in sales trends at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar in May. It's still early in the quarter, but it's gotten off to a positive start for both banners, and I'm pleased with a kick-off to the summer season. We expect to continue to see pressure on freight cost, both inbound and outbound for the foreseeable future. We are taking action to minimize the impact of these costs. Also, we are seeing diesel cost run higher than a year ago, and higher than we had planned. Both of these cost pressures are included in the outlook.","Our ocean freight rate negotiated in April came in lower than originally planned. We should begin to see the benefits of the lower-than-anticipated rates in the back half of the year. This was also contemplated in our updated outlook.","As we detailed last quarter, we are investing in our business with more labor hours in the stores, more competitive wages and benefits, and in-store standards. We are investing in these specific areas because we believe they will drive our business and create a better opportunity for our stores. I'm counting on our teams to be able to drive a better experience and more sales. Our Q1 performance was a bit of two stories, the Dollar Tree segment, strong, resilient, relevant bounced back after the weather and planned for and overcame an early Easter. I was really pleased with all of our teams' efforts and achievement. Family Dollar was impacted particularly hard by weather in two our seasonal assorts in the spring, apparel and lawn and garden.","In comparison, Family Dollar consumables business comped positive in Q1. I'm please with the results and efforts we are making in rebuilding our brand in relevance to our customer around a better shopping experience, greater value and convenience as demonstrated by Family Dollar's good start to the second quarter. As we move into the summer season our store field teams, merchants and support teams are focused on our initiatives and the basics to deliver our banner and company goals.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Great, thanks. I guess, Gary, on the Family Dollar front, how best to think about same-store sales in the quarter maybe versus your internal plan? And if we took a multiyear view here, is there anything structural that you've identified with the concept that changes the way that you look at the productivity opportunity today maybe versus how you did a year or two ago?","Gary Philbin","I don't think so. I think we're still -- Matt, we're still building the business. It's obviously fragile. So I think for this low income customer that we serve in particular areas of Family Dollar when we do get disruption, which we could point to some of the weather impacts, our customer just doesn't buy some of the categories that I pointed out until she really needs it. And so when I take a look at Q1, part of it just being the fact that was the weather, I think there's nothing structurally. We see the renovations continuing to make progress as we change what the customer sees in the fleet of stores. We continue to see private brands drive our business when we changed the labels and introduced them to our stores. And we're going to continue to invest in stores. And that's a little bit of labor. It's going to be the capital that we invest. That's going to be the long-term structural change.","I think as I take a look at Q1 to Q2, and I can point to the things that impacted our sales across those categories, great. Now that's one -- guess what, the warmer weather items are selling like we thought, and had the swing from what we saw in Q1 to driving some of the positive comps that we're seeing at the start of Q2. So it's, to me, it's everything we've talked to at the beginning, what are the fundamentals that are going to drive our customer value, let's get our pricing right. That's everything that Smart Ways to Save brings to the party across our store from being EDLP to private brands to $1 Wow, let's improve the store experience. And some of that's going to be capital with changing the fleet. And at the end of the day it's going to be investing in our store folks so we can run great stores in all 8,000-plus Family Dollars.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then, Kevin, on gross margin at the Family Dollar concept, asides from the sales-related occupancy de-leverage this quarter, which is -- if that makes sense, can you just walk through any differences versus your plan on the gross margin front at Family Dollar, and how best to think about this line item and drivers as the year progresses?","Kevin Wampler","Yes, Matt, I think obviously the other big callout is shrink really for both banners, but as I noted in our prepared remarks, both banners were affected by approximately 30 basis points negatively in gross margin [technical difficulty] which is very significant from our perspective. So we have to -- obviously our teams are engaged and working to understand the issues. The one thing about shrink is once you see a trend it does take a little while typically to reverse one of those trends. So that again plays into the way we think about going forward the rest of the year. So that's obviously a big game changer from my perspective.","The other thing is, obviously we've spoken to freight; it's trended a little higher than what we spoke to at the beginning of the year. Again, a lot of it being related to driver issues which then basically affects backhauls as well and the efficiencies we're able to gain or not gain from that. So those are the two areas that would probably be the callouts that I would say.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot of taking my question. So when we look at the spread between Family Dollar same-store sales and Dollar general same-store sales that were also reported this morning, that expanded to 320 basis points. And we have seen pretty steady expansion in that spread for the last couple of years now. And it's not a completely clean number, but it really is the only way that we have to benchmark the influence of the teams having over its own performance. So why do you think that spread is expanding and was larger in the first quarter than it's been in some time?","Gary Philbin","Hey, Michael, it's Gary. Let me take this one. I think everything we have our teams working on are going to be the fundamentals over the long-term change that dynamic. So, it starts with the top line, everything that we do to drive that ought to be showing up in comp stores sales. I think in Q1 though this, for our Family Dollar, where our customers are served in urban settings; it is my opinion their shopping habits, travel patterns get more disrupted perhaps more easily with some of the weather. And if you're low income you don't buy some of the segments that we have, apparel being the biggest one that says when you buy short sleeve and dresses for Easter and when there's snow on the ground it just doesn't work the same way at the Family Dollar store.","So I sort of want to bucket Q1 into the things that we can sort of point to because we could see the categories that were impacted by the weather. And when we compare year-over-year the segments that were out there that should've been performing you could see, \"Oh, well, there's another winter storm.\" So that's a piece of it. I think structurally, longer-term; it's still everything we've been talking about. We've got to continue to have renovated stores that will drive comps. Those are the elements that behind comp stores sales or any banner at the end of the day will help us drive comps. What they'll do is improve the adjacencies, get the right square footage in store for the right departments. That's just the work that's out there that we have to do to improve comps structurally quarter-over-quarter.","So Q1 is what it is. We've cinched our belts up a notch going into the summertime. We believe we had the right assortment, and when it got a bit warmer we started to see that respond. So we're not going to judge it by one quarter, we're going to take a look at the whole year with our plans, and continue down the path of the things that we know our customer responds to, which is a better store because it's been renovated or expanded frozen food doors because I get more of the assortment I need. And along way we're taking a look at the assortments and categories to create more value in there whether it's more private brand or whether it's assortment gaps that we need to improve. And that would never stop. And along the way, for us at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, it still drives a lot of it based on what we do once a year on going on our import trips by season. We go multiple times a year of course.","But I think when you take a look at the Dollar Tree comp, of 4% year-over-year with those headwinds, this is -- that same kind of energy can work at a Family Dollar. Customer relies on us more on basics. She does need us at the beginning of the month and in a different way at the end of the month, but it's going to be those fundamentals that drive a more consistent comp over time.","Michael Lasser","And presumably a piece of the equation with Family Dollar is a lower penetration of the coolers and freezers and some of the consumable products that drive traffic. But do you have any plans to accelerate and really act with a greater amount of force to roll out more coolers and freezers to provide more consistency in the traffic for that business?","Gary Philbin","Well, I think we have a pretty aggressive project plan this year between both banners. We're going to be touching well over a thousand projects. I think we are doing it in an accelerated fashion both with the renovations, which are bigger projects at Family Dollar, along with the impact of additional doors mainly around frozen foods, exactly to your point. So that's in the hopper, and that's what we're continuing to work on for this year. So I think it's a key point, our customer does rely on that category maybe more than others do because of what it does for both snacking and meal planning for her on a -- different weeks of the month. So that's in the plan.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Best of luck. Thank you.","Gary Philbin","Thank you.","Operator","Thank You. Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. Kevin, I just wanted to confirm that I heard correctly the Family Dollar inventory was up 14% per square foot, that that's correct. It looks like the projected payback in revenue and gross profit dollars is minimal. I just wanted to see if you could explain that. And then also if you think this significant inventory build is contributing to the higher shrink accrual of 30 basis points?","Kevin Wampler","Yes, I mean, I think when we look at our inventory at Family Dollar, as we've said, we have been consistently working to improve in-stock levels, specially first of the month, being ready for that key time to service that customer. And so that's always been something, as well as the fact that, as I mentioned, several category resets going on currently which has elevated some levels of inventory for that. So the expectation would be as we go through the year that will come back down. And as I pointed out, the other point being is we were actually down a year ago, at this point in time, 4.2% on a selling square foot basis as we were going through some of the changes. So, all in all, I think inventory is where we would expect it to be.","As far as shrink, I mean obviously when you have more inventory in the stores, that can have an affect on shrink, I don't know that I would specifically say that's leading to shrink because, honestly, the shrink results are really for stores that are being inventoried since a year ago. And the inventory levels last year tended to be lower in general. So I don't know that that's exactly a cause, but it's something that we do keep our eye on because it can be an effect in the longer term.","Gary Philbin","Dan, I would just add my color to it. We did several measured tests in our Family Dollar stores. And listen, our customer research at the beginning of this said our customers are disappointed with anecdotes [ph]. And that's a function of supply chain. Sometimes it's a function of the replenishment we put into the store. We want and aim for specific categories to get meatier on the shelf. And so we're going to run year-over-year on a higher inventory level. Q1 also reflect some of the items that are in place to try to minimize the anecdotes as we do reset. So rather than linger, get the product in the store and that's part of what's driving up inventory too. But I think your last point is a real one. I mean, I would just tell you if I put my operator hat on, yes, I think we've got to bring down some of the inventory levels across some of the categories. And that ought to help shrink. The thing with shrink is you have a couple of good years or three good years and people -- it's not that they take their eye of the ball, but it becomes a priority further down their checklist, and we got to get it right back underneath sales and people development at both banners, quite frankly, as the things that we monitor on a weekly, monthly basis.","Q \u2013 Dan Wewer","Hi Gary, just a quick follow-up, Smart Ways to Save has placed a big focus on private label, digital coupons, better end caps, et cetera, do you think we are now at the point where we need to get more aggressive in pricing for branded consumables in the Family Dollar segment to help bridge that sales deficiency?","Gary Philbin","I would tell you that we had some very good comps across some of the national brand categories and brands for Q1 despite the overall comp being down. It's never one arrow in the quiver, I think to me, it's our customers thrive and then survive at the end of the month many times, our lowest income customer. I think we can trade her up when she has some money in her pocket, but we can't stray too far promoting opening price point, and that's really what Smart Ways to Save was to basically put an umbrella over, and that says there's a number of ways to entice this customer.","You are right, we have to be right on every day pricing, and everything that we see shows us more competitive than last year at the same time. I think the merchant team has done a nice job, gaining some line on some of the right assortment. I think the private brands show our customer even greater savings, and our Smart Ways to Save is giving us some market intelligence to our customer, which she buys one from first of month to the end of the month. So, it's an umbrella for how we are going to go after this whole approach knowing our customer better, buying brands, enticing it with private label, and dollar allowance is going to be part of our DNA. Obviously it's been Family Dollar. We can certainly help it with our Dollar Tree business.","Q \u2013 Dan Wewer","Great, thank you.","Gary Philbin","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. I'm going to circle back to the top line questions asked and try to approach it just slightly differently. Gary, what do you calculate the impact of weather to the 1Q comp to be for the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree banners? And are you suggesting that the headwind to Family Dollar was significantly greater than Dollar Tree? And then just to confirm, the Family Dollar comps, are they positive quarter-to-date? I think that's what you mentioned, and just want to know how you are thinking about deals and Dollar Trees top line over the balance of the year, and I guess at the crux of the last part of the question is how does your outlook on the health or the spending power of your core customer changed at all?","Gary Philbin","Yes, comps are positive as we -- let me start with that. And the weather does impact Family Dollar more around those two big categories as I mentioned; Dollar Tree doesn't have an apparel department, really it's a bigger category obviously at Family Dollar. At lawn and garden at Family Dollars everything that we sell in charcoal and grills and what people buy when the weather gets nice. We have a different market, different customer segment, and we're going to have different product at Dollar Tree. I think it's quite frankly remarkable that Dollar Tree merchants, operators, field teams, I mean comp with an early Easter and knowing what we are faced with snow on the ground in March, I mean really my hats off to the team, it's one thing to plan it, but the team executed that, and that was really pleased. And Family Dollar for all those reasons, private being our customers, if you don't have a car, your bus line gets disrupted, you are shopping differently. So I would say that the things that I point to for our customer, and I don't know how to think about the health of our customer, you know, if your our customer maybe tend to be impacted more by apartment rents, which we've seen go up more, fuel is up, lots of our customers arriving in buses to work and to stores obviously and we are all of us still about cars like anybody else up in that part of the world, but I'd sort of point to this customer when she has money and we have the right offering, we have seen it respond and that's a difference between the banners.","I think how do we overcome that over time? I think goes back to what we've been working off. It's being convenient. It's getting the stores renovated, so that was a reason to go there, it's what's new at our Family Dollar. So besides being right on the basics that spark that we got to have in our store on the merchandizing piece, some of that is tied to the seasonal, some of this is going to be closed down, some of it's just going to the stuff we invent, because we can when we go over to Asia and find some new products. So it's a combination of those things that will build the strength of the Family Dollar brand over time.","And for Dollar Tree, I mean, I feel like our folks are on it, they have the right agenda items in front of them. We don't like where shrink is for either banner right now, but we view that as a controllable expense. We've got to get back to the basics on that, and then drive that down from the impact that we are seeing this year. So what's how I'm thinking about it, and like I said we are pleased with how Q2 is starting out, because the same categories that sort of kicked this in Q1, we saw respond at the beginning of Q2 here.","Paul Trussell","And what synergies if any are you still taking advantage of and see flow into the P&L this year? And what are your updated thoughts on Family Dollar's EBIT margin potential and the timetable and the comp needed to get there?","Gary Philbin","Well, let me tell, the synergies towards the kick off around really the big buckets were identical similar match on items, it was the read banners, so Family Dollars to Dollar Trees. It was going after our indirect product, and a smaller portion was around logistics. At least that we have been able to take advantage of, one DC that's now co-banner. So, as we kick this off and work through that, those elements are in our P&Ls for both banners as we march forward. It doesn't mean we don't stop taking auctions together or finding opportunities to get cost down to system, but really we get one bite at the apple for synergy number. And so, the teams work together now to leverage vendors, to find the right vendors, to find people that need capacity to go to the market on the merchandize side, same on indirect.","And the read banners while we're going to do a sprinkling of them this year, they'll be more of an opportunistic. I think to go back to your question we said we will be able to get back to historical levels, and we have got to be able to do that by driving that top line sales number and to me the underpinnings of that are going to be renovations, new stores. Now we are doing about 300 new stores a year, yes, I think ultimately you want a bigger number of Family Dollar stores coming out of the pipe in that. So, as we slowed it down to make the -- do the needed work we needed to on adjacencies and work and that's part of our renovation, that's how new Family Dollar opens up now. As that fleet changes, that will give us some stability and top line comps over time.","The work that's going to go on, on the merchandizing side won't stop, but it's going to be underneath the umbrella of Smart Ways to Save on the elements that we've been talking about this morning. So we're still in the path there. The things that we signed up for the beginning are still there, but to get there, we do have to invest in the facilities and the stores, or people too, and keep driving the incredible values that we need for our customers to give them the reason to come into our Family Dollar at the beginning of the month and the end of the month.","Paul Trussell","Thanks for the color. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hi, guys; Scot Ciccarelli. I guess, it's a little bit of a follow-on to Paul's question. According to your proxy, you guys have already exceeded your synergy target, and so I guess if I could -- if you could provide just a little bit more color, Gary, in terms of what you are talking about, are there still more costs to extract with Family Dollar or the way you guys kind of thought about synergies, or is it as you start to -- I think start to imply you really need to generate sales growth and natural leverage to drive significant bottom-line improvement at Family Dollar. Just what's the right way to think about it, cost coming out or is it kind of natural leverage and we got to get the top line to generate that? ","Gary Philbin","Well, Scot, I think as we think about it, it always starts with driving top line, for sure, but we always have been a very cost conscious business and to your point on the synergy, we stated from day one, the expectation of achieving $300 million in run rate synergies at the end of three-year.","To your point in the proxy, we did note that it had been certified that we had a long-term performance plan related to it -- $450 million had been achieved. As part of that, we reinvested some of those dollars as we went along as well to improve the business and move it forward as you would think we would. We've had some significant success in the areas of indirect spend, cost of goods sold and banner optimization, you know, exceeding our targets in those areas. And so that was very good. But so now we're really about 30 days away from hitting that three-year mark and we're really transitioning from what we would call synergy initiatives to what we would really call our normal process as it relates to cost savings and process improvement that have been a long part of our performance based culture here at Dollar Tree.","So I think those type of things, to Gary's point, will continue. We'll continue to work on various processes in cause and issue, we're just not going to speak to synergies anymore, that's kind of run its course at this point in time and -- but to your point, those things will continue, it's very important to us. But we do really need to drive top line to get where we would like to get from -- in the long-term with our margin.","Scot Ciccarelli","Understood. Okay, thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.","John Heinbockel","So Gary, two things, maybe related, probably not, how would you assess store conditions at Family Dollar today? Obviously, in-stock is most important, but just overall shopability, how would you assess that, where do you think with the investments you're making in labor how much improvement do you think you can achieve here as we head out maybe into 2019?","And then secondarily, the shrink at Dollar Tree, where is that coming from be it product category or process or bucket? And I guess, that would be with us for a while, right until you do more physicals?","Gary Philbin","Well, let me start with the store conditions at Family Dollar. They've improved and I would give our store teams and field teams credit. Are we fragile or are we perfect, no, we still have a ways to go, and it's a little, you know, we run our stores with sometimes minimum coverage. And so a truck gets late or the bus shows up with customers, we can be at risk. But I think the fundamentals that we're building around how do we think about building a schedule, the work to be done, and it sort of speaks to your second question then where do you invest in a Family Dollar on the labor side. And this isn't rocket science. This is about getting our stores stocked, it's getting them phased out and recovered and taking care of customers primarily. And it's how do we drive each of those buckets to maximum efficiency. So, on our investment, we're not trying to peanut butter every store everywhere. We're really trying to invest in the stores that we see upside, because of sales trends and our opportunity to invest in labor specifically around those categories to drive the difference.","Now, beyond that the facilities along the way, we made an investment too. Cleaner floors, not deferring maintenance, getting our hands around all the things that work against our own best interests sometimes when we do that. So we've always tried to manage in real time, but we've also tried to say over the long run what is it you need for our customers who ought to have a better shopping experience. So those are some of the elements the team at Family Dollar have been working on. And there's upside with the right investment in store labor, both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. At Dollar Tree, sometimes it's as simple as let's move the freight from the back room to the sales floor and the comp comes. And at Family Dollar, it's some of that, but it's also let's work on getting the adjacencies right, the renovations, the things we're doing around the stores with the renovation and new store program. So it comes down to both of those.","Shrink, to me, I could give you lots of different reasons, but I sort of boil it down to we got some forward-looking score cards that tell us where the issues are. We got to get into them when there's smoke not fire. And it's a matter of reacting to basically the data that we see staring ahead of us. And you're right, I mean, we're through 50% of our inventories, so we don't see much of a runway to impact this year. But everything we're doing now is going to impact next year's performance. And that's why you can never stop working really, really hard on shrink. So that starts at store level and goes all the way up the food chain. I think our folks got the right information data to make a difference. And we're counting on them to do that over the next six months for next year.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Gary Philbin","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Chuck Grom","Hey, thanks, just a couple of questions here on the guidance, Kevin, kind of following up on Paul's earlier. I just want to see if you guys are still comfortable with positive comps in the remainder of the year across both banners. And then on the gross margin line, I think, back in March you said down 20 to 30 basis points. I was wondering if you could update that line item for us.","Kevin Wampler","Obviously, we give guidance on an enterprise basis as it relates to our comps as we've said, low single-digit comps. So we're obviously comfortable with that. As it relates to gross margin, I think there probably is a little more pressure than what we had initially said obviously with the fact that shrink as well as trade are obviously up in the gross margin category and given what we've seen there and what we've talked about today, there'll be a little bit more pressure within that line item going forward.","Chuck Grom","And then just on the weather issue, I'll try another crack at it. A number of retailers have sort of backed that out or tried to back it out, just wondering if the first quarter seasonal business, apparel business had trended similar to what you're seeing today, any sense for what Family Dollar would have comped in the first quarter?","Kevin Wampler","Well, I don't know. It's a game of what ifs. But I know it's a big enough impact on Q1 that it was -- it's part of why we had a negative comp. I mean, that and lawn and garden I can almost put a fence around and say those were the issues. And I think when it gets warm it pops as it should. And I think that's -- tells me we got some of the right things out in store and our customers who find it, because she does need it now, short seat short fit. I went back to some of our weeks when in March you're -- some of your better categories are long-sleeved hoodies and tops. That's not a good thing for [technical difficulty]. So I think we saw that switch now as we got into May and into the traditional shopping patterns.","Chuck Grom","Okay. And then just one last one, just bigger picture. And obviously, before you acquired Family Dollar, there was a number of issues, some of which were price. Some of it was execution and then a lot of people thought it was real estate. You've done a really good job on price, I think table stakes initiatives based on our checks look great, which kind of leaves real estate as the problem. And I'm wondering -- you know, I don't want to look at first quarter and run with it too far, but do you think there's a real estate problem with the FDO segment? And if so then how do you address that in the timelines you've set to address it? ","Kevin Wampler","I won't say a problem. I think the opportunity that we saw going in was -- there's a number of different store formats out there that don't give the right square footage the right departments, which is what part of the renovation program does. And over time, it's a fleet of stores at -- some stores come up every year on lease renewal. So while it's a bit of -- the pieces are on the chessboard, over time, we can take advantage of where we think we ought to be and perform the best. But I would say -- you know, I don't know how to put a proportion to it. Part of it was going to be getting the opportunity to put stores where we want them with the new store program. They'll be closing down stores that aren't performing for whatever reason. But I think the more exciting part of the business and the reason we did this was the opportunity to drive renovations in the new stores where we want. That's the top side and really where we see the opportunity for Family Dollar.","So all those other things you talked about, yes, get the pricing right, get the execution better in store, let's invest in the store. Over time, those are the things in retail that tend to come back and drive store performance. So, we are not taking our sights off those important elements as we go forward.","Chuck Grom","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Guiler for closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you for joining us for today's call, and especially for your continued interest in Dollar Tree.

The components of this strategy include first of all, category expansions. Our customers are finding more value as we continue to rationalize and expand assortments and pet supplies, hardware, healthcare, beauty and eye ware, as well as home and household products.","Customers are continuing to respond favorable to our powerful and relevant seasonal and party presentations. Our seasonal assortments continue to create merchandize energy as our store fronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we strive to own the seasons at the $1 price point.","Store teams continue to focus on customer engagement in our stores and especially at the checkout counters to drive impulse and related item sales. We're keenly focused on providing value and a shopping experience that exceeds the expectations of every customers and every store, every day.","Being first of the month ready is important to our customers. Our merchants and our store associates place increased emphasis on displays of basic, consumable core items at the first of each month when more customers are shopping for their basic needs.","Additionally, we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the fourth quarter, we installed freezer and coolers in 82 additional stores, bringing our 2014 total to 473 additional stores.","We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3,621 stores with plans to continue adding this important category to more stores. Frozen and refrigerated merchandize is generally lower margin, but it is faster turning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories including the higher margin discretionary product. Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customers.","In addition to New Dollar Tree stores in the U.S., Dollar Tree Canada and deals are key brands in our portfolio and key components of our growth strategy. In fourth quarter, we continued to grow our store count in Canada by adding five new stores. For the full year 2014 we added 30 net new stores, expanded two stores and ended the year with a total of 210 Dollar Tree Canada stores.","We are building the merchant and store teams in Canada to better serve the Canadian customer. Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher value product and our Canadian customers are finding boarder, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores.","We're pleased with the progress we're making in Canada and in fact the fourth quarter comp for Dollar Tree Canada was its strongest quarter yet.","We've significant growth potential in Canada. We are confident that Canadian market will support up to a 1,000 Dollar Tree Stores and this is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of 125 just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 price point.","Our deals format further extends our ability to serve more customers. By lifting the restriction of the $1 dollar price point, we have the opportunity to serve more customers with more categories.","Deal stores provide low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. The stores operate using a multiple price point strategy and they have the potential to generate higher store volume with a higher average ticket. We ended the year with a total 219 deal stores.","In addition to Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and deals are online business at Dollar Tree Direct is growing in size and performance. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores.","In the fourth quarter, we significantly enhanced the functionality of the site -- of the site search feature on our website. Now when customers search for a specific product, they're provided relevant and related content for the product including videos, craft sheets, ratings and reviews.","Our Dollar Tree customers are crafty, savvy, frugal and connected and this enhance site search functionality plays to all those trades.","Also in Q4 Dollar Tree Direct introduced a new holiday Christmas section of our website. This section has provided a video and interactive game and many great holiday craft and gift ideas.","Based on the number of customers, both old and new that flock to the site, we know it was a big hit. We continue to leverage social media to connect with customers.","A few examples of our growth include our loyalty program called the Value Secrets Club, which has grown nearly 80% over the past 12 months. Our email subscriber database has grown 26% and our Facebook fan base has increased by 31%.","Social media continues to provide tremendous opportunities to communicate about exciting events and great products both in our stores and online.","Whether customers prefer to contact Dollar Tree Direct via their phones, their tablets, their laptops or their desktops, we're ready and able to connect with them. We continue to be very pleased with the growth of both sales and visitors to our Dollar Tree Direct business. Please check us out at dollartree.com.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our initial outlook for 2015.","Kevin Wampler","Thank you, Bob.","As Bob mentioned, our adjusted fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7% to $1.16 per diluted share. Once again we're very pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency 5.6% comp sales performance was composed of a 5% increase in traffic and a 0.5% increase in average ticket.","Geographically, our performance was strongest in the Midwest and Southeast as well as markets where we cycled significant weather disruptions from a year ago.","In our previous 8-K, we announced our same-store sales for the first two months of the quarter was 5.2%. January was our strongest comp month of the quarter as we were cycling a large number of weather-related store closing from the prior year.","Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 37.1% during the fourth quarter compared with 36.9% in the prior year fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points. The improvement was a result of the following.","We gained 30 basis points of leverage on occupancy and distribution cost resulting from the strong same-store sales. We experienced higher initial mark-up and reduced mark-downs across many categories. The higher IMU reflects continued improvement in sourcing and the flexibility of our merchandise model.","Overall merchandise mix contributed to margin rate; however was offset by our commitment to provide greater value to consumers in order to drive traffic and capture share. We continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing.","Freight cost as a percentage of sales increased as domestic trucking rates were higher reflecting the effects of industry-wide driver shortages. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel cost.","Excluding acquisition-related costs, SG&A expenses were 21.3% of sales for the quarter, flat compared to the fourth quarter last year. Payroll-related expenses increased 25 basis points for the quarter, as store bonuses, retirement plan contributions and incentive compensation increased based on the company's strong performance. These were partially offset by reduced store payroll due to improved productivity and lower Workers Compensation expenses.","Store operating and corporate costs improved in the areas of utilities, repairs and maintenance, store supply, legal fees and depreciation, offsetting the payroll related expense increase.","Adjusted operating income increased $42.1 million compared to the fourth quarter last year and adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 15.8%. For full year 2014, our operating margin was 12.4%, consistent with last year, despite persistent freight cost headwinds related to the domestic driver shortages in the trucking industry.","The tax rate for the quarter was 36.6% versus 37.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This decrease was due to the reenactment of the work opportunities, tax credit for 2014 in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, the tax rate was 37.3% compared with 37.5% in 2013.","Looking at the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at yearend totaled $864.1 million versus $267.7 million at the end of fiscal 2013. Our consolidated inventory at yearend was flat to last year, while selling square footage increased 7.4%.","Consolidated inventory per selling square foot actually decreased 6.9% and our inventory turn improved 30 basis points to 4.4 times for the year. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for 2015.","The company uses a retail inventory method to assign cost to store inventories. In fiscal 2010, the company made an inventory accounting change for its U.S. operations going from one inventory pool to approximately 30. Effective February 1, 2015, the first phase of fiscal 2015, the company will adopt the same method for our Canadian operations.","This change will facilitate improved decision making and further enhance our assortment planning process. The company expects to record a non-recurring, non-cash charge to gross profit and a corresponding reduction in inventory at cost of approximately $3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2015. This impact is included in our guidance. There will be no effect on prior periods related to this change in inventory accounting.","Capital expenditures were $71.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This compares with $46 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2014, capital expenditures were $325.6 million, which was below our prior expectation of $360 million to $370 million and compares with $330.1 in 2013.","For 2015 we're currently planning consolidated capital expenditures to range from $465 million to $475 million. Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, the addition of frozen or refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancements, the construction of a new South East distribution center and the expansion of our current Olive Branch, Mississippi Distribution Center.","Please note that upon completion of the Family Dollar transaction, we may reconsider our 2015 capital expenditure plan based on a comprehensive review of the combined distribution network and related capacity.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $54.4 million for the fourth quarter versus $50.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. For 2014, total depreciation was $205.9 million, a four basis point improvement from last year. For 2015, depreciation and amortization estimated to range from $215 million to $225 million.","Our initial outlook for guidance for 2015 includes the following assumptions. We anticipate that freight cost will continue to be a headwind to gross margin for the year based on continued pressure on freight rates.","We are budgeting lower diesel fuel cost than a year ago. As you have noticed, weather has presented early challenges throughout most of our Northern and Midwestern areas to this point in the first quarter.","Easter will be two weeks earlier than the prior year, which represents an estimated $8 million headwind to sales. We're pleased to see agreement was reached last week and related to the West Coast ports. We may continue to experience some product delays as the port congestion is relieved in the upcoming months.","The previously mentioned non-cash charge of $0.01 per diluted share related to the inventory accounting change and we do not anticipate any share repurchases in 2015 and we cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we do not adjust our guidance for any potential changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.4% for the first quarter and 38.3% for the full year.","Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 206.9 million shares for the first quarter and 207.1 million shares for the full year.","For the first quarter 2015 we\u2019re forecasting sales to range from $2.15 billion to $2.20 billion and diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition cost in the range of $0.69 to $0.74, which would represent a 3% to 10% increase, compared to the first quarter of 2014 earnings of $0.67 per diluted share.","The sales range implies a low-to-mid single digit comparable store sales increase and 6.9% square footage growth. Additionally, we\u2019ve not included any acquisition related cost on our first quarter guidance as we cannot currently forecast the timing of when these costs will be incurred.","For the full fiscal year of 2015, we\u2019re forecasting sales in the range of $9.21 billion to $9.45 billion based on a low-to-mid single digit increase in same-store sales and 7.2% square footage growth.","Diluted earnings per share excluding acquisition related costs are expected to range from $3.30 to $3.50. This represents an increase of 6% to 12% over 2014 earnings per diluted share, excluding acquisition related costs of $3.12.","Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I did want to address one question that some of you expressed. Following the completion of the Family Dollar transaction, we will adopt segment reporting. This will provide you with visibility into the performance of both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar on a standalone basis.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you very much Kevin. Before going to the Q&A, I want to make a few comments on our pending acquisitions of Family Dollar. I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re more enthusiastic about the transaction today than when we originally announced our merger agreement in late July.","We\u2019re extremely encouraged to see the overwhelming support from Family Dollar shareholders on their January 22, vote. Their approval was a crucial step in our moving forward with the transaction that will create a leading discount retailer in North America.","I\u2019m pleased that throughout the process, Dollar Tree remained committed to its strategy and was able to gain shareholder approval without increasing our offer. I would like to personally commend Family Dollar\u2019s team members on their efforts over the past seven months.","While their reported results have not been stellar, we acknowledge that they\u2019ve been operating through unique circumstances with great uncertainty regarding the future of the Family Dollar business and we\u2019re eager to welcome Family Dollar associates to the Dollar Tree team.","We appreciate the dedication and efforts of Family Dollars' associates throughout the integration planning process and we look forward to working together to further grow and improve the Family Dollar brand.","The strategic rationale for this combination is powerful. We are combining two very large companies with more than 13,000 stores achieving almost $19 billion in sales and more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA.","We\u2019re combining two established and respected brands in the most economically resilient sector of retailing. The discount retail sector has flourished through all economic cycles. We are combining two complementary business models across fixed and multi-priced strategies creating the ability to serve a broader range of customers and geography.","The Dollar Tree target customer is largely a suburban customer, while the Family Dollar customer is largely urban and rural. We're combining complementary merchandise expertise adding the Family Dollar's strength and name brand consumable products to the Dollar Tree variety, seasonal and discretionary product and global sourcing power.","This combination generates significant immediate opportunities for operational improvement and near-term opportunities for synergies. We've identified the opportunity to realize at least $300 million in annual run rate hard cost synergies by the end of year three.","We've categorized these synergies into four primary categories and I've ranked them in order of magnitude. First is sourcing and procurement. Opportunities here will include lower cost of products through leveraging the size of our buys, rationalizing our vendor base, driving scale with common vendors, increasing direct to factory sourcing and increased efficiencies through global sourcing and the supply chain.","Second is format optimization. We will operate and grow both banners and we plan to re-banner our stores selectively to better match the brand to the market demographic and to improve productivity of the store.","Most of the early rebannering will be Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores. Next is reduced overhead. Over time, we will reduce cost through shared services, reducing redundant public company and broad cost and through our systems integrations.","And last distribution and logistics through scale and operational efficiency, we expect to reduce inbound and outbound freight cost, both domestic and international. Additionally, primary areas of our initial focus will include first of all, the customer.","A focus on the needs of the value customer and delivering the merchandising assortment that serves their needs and their wants. This will include a mix of name brand and private label basics alongside variety and seasonally relevant product. We will continue to return to EDLP and delivering value at competitive prices.","Second productivity, we will focus on improving sales per foot and inventory productivity by expanding high performing categories and eliminating products that do not meet our sales and profitability threshold.","We plan to focus on the customer experience and improving the table stakes by developing plans to consistently deliver the promise of a bright, clean and friendly store to shop. We will be tracking key metrics to monitor progress.","We plan to focus on reducing deal management turnover and providing appropriate incentives to the people who directly serve our customers. We plan to improve our new store remodeling expansion performance with a keen focus on profitability, improvement and metrics and ROIC.","Overall, we will bring a disciplined approach to driving a key strategic initiative and a performance oriented call through to the larger company through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives.","We're confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.","I'll tell you that both companies are ready to integrate the lengthy delays through this process and have afforded us a significant amount of time to focus on integration planning.","Our integration management office is comprised of 10 functional teams that have detailed strategies, objectives and tasks with assigned milestones for achieving these tasks.","Our functional teams are dedicated to the cost of goods sold, supply chain and direct spending, merchandising, finance, human resources, information technology, general and administrative costs including legal, internal audit and others, real estate and store operations.","Our team is incredibly excited about this transformational opportunity to grow our business for the long term by adding the Family Dollar banner to the Dollar Tree portfolio of brands.","As always, we will manage this business with a focus on what is best for our stakeholders including our customers, our vendor partners, our associates are importantly, our long term shareholders.","Now back to Dollar Tree, as I previously mentioned, I am extremely proud of the team's fourth quarter full year performance and I am incredibly excited about Dollar Tree's future.","The Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever providing extreme value to customers, while recording record level of earnings. Our model has been tested by times and validated by history.","For seven consecutive years, quarter after quarter, Dollar Tree has delivered same-store sales increases of more than 1% every single quarter. Consumers are looking for no matter the state of the economy.","For six consecutive years, our annual gross margin rate has exceeded 35%. At Dollar Tree, we are in control of our gross margin rate. It's all about the mix and having an extremely disciplined approach to sourcing product for our stores.","We've consistently delivered solid margin rates for both inflationary and deflationary cycles. Our expenses are managed effectively focused on overall returns and as a result of driving sales, managing margins and controlling expenses, we've delivered five consecutive years of double-digit operating margins that continue to lead the discount retail sectors.","We remain committed to the concept our customers love and we're positioned for continued profitable growth for many years ahead. We have a talented management team that has a long history of retail success and importantly with the addition of Family Dollar, we will be a bigger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets with exactly what they're looking for great value.","So it\u2019s a great time to be Dollar Tree, our inventories are clean and fresh, the shelves are full of the right product for the first half of 2015 and our values have never been better. Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Max Hayground for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our question.","As we kind of look at the full year and you operating margin, you guys have performed pretty solid gross margins, but as you are bringing on Family Dollar, how should we start to look at that, especially as you're going through the heavy lifting of the integration starting with banners and systems before we get to maybe some of the logistical synergies. Thank you.","Kevin Wampler","Hi Max, this is Kevin. Obviously, we're not a point to specifically speak to those type of metrics at this point in time. As Bob pointed out, there is a lot of integration work being done. Teams comprised of folks from both organization working very hard, determining where the efficiencies can be gained and taking the best practices from both companies and looking at the way we can improve.","So obviously what we talked about, we talked about $300 million run rate synergies at the end of year three and beyond what we've said today, we're not really ready to say anything else as it relates to specific numbers of the ongoing combined organization.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you. And also just with your online business, it seems like you guys have been doing a lot of great performance there with Dollar Tree Direct and you mentioned that the demographics of that customer might be a little different, could you maybe expand a bit on that?","Kevin Wampler","Well I think that the demographics are Middle America as people are looking for value. In addition to that, it's small businesses, its organizations that need larger quantities, they may need full case quantities. Our average ticket on the online business is much higher.","It's much higher than it is in our stores. So it's really broad swath of Middle America with small business and organizations and schools and individuals that just may need a little extra for a party or just see the great values that we have.","In addition to that Max, it's a terrific opportunity for us to connect with our customers directly to understand who our customers are, to communicate through our value secrets club to know who they are, what they want, what they want to buy, and to share with them our upcoming promotional events, what\u2019s new in our stores and just the Dollar Tree and deal story.","So it really serves both means to sell product, to serve the customer and also to continue to drive home the Dollar Tree Brand.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks a lot I really appreciate it.","Kevin Wampler","Thank you, Max.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital.","Anthony Chukumba","Thank you for taking my question. I think my first question was, could you give us a little bit of an update on deal? I know you mentioned that Dollar Tree Canada had its strongest comp yet and I just wonder if we could get little more color on how deals performed in Q4?","Bob Sasser","Sure, I would be happy to do that. First of all, we ended the year with 219 deal stores and we don\u2019t breakout our comp separately, but I would tell you that our comps were single-digit positive in our deal stores.","As the trend has been, we have a merchandize mix of both consumables and discretionary products that's more consumable than discretionary in our deal stores. It's in the fourth quarter of course with all of the holiday needs and all the holiday variety of merchandize that we have in the stores.","Consumables were 56.4%, which is down a little bit, it's usually about 60% and our non-consumable is up a little bit 43.6%. So because of the holiday, we were able to sell a little more discretionary and seasonal product in our deal stores.","The basket, the average ticket of a basket when we had items that are greater than $1 was $15.62 and more than half of all transactions 52.3% had items greater than a $1 in them.","So our customers are understanding the merchandize and they're understanding the assortment, they're responding appropriately. Average unit retail, average retail of one item that they bought was $3.35 in our deals stores and the greater than $1 item represented 51% of the deals total sales.","We'll tell you that our strongest sales growth comps by category and the deals business in fourth quarter were Christmas textile, cleaning supplies, household plastics had a terrific quarter and our electronic department driven by phone and tablet accessories did very well in the fourth quarter.","Anthony Chukumba","Okay, that\u2019s really, really helpful color. And then just one quick follow-up, you mentioned the possibility of rebranding or just changing Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree and maybe doing some vise versa. What about deals and would you consider any -- changing any deal locations to Family Dollar or Family Dollar locations to deals.","Bob Sasser","I think so, we haven't run those models yet as opposed to what we've done is we've taken -- our real estate model and run the Family Dollar Stores through them, especially on the lower performing Family Dollar Store to see how they would perform as a Dollar Tree.","And that\u2019s been our first priority was to take a look at the Family Dollar underperforming Family Dollar Stores that would perform better as Dollar Tree Stores, but deal certainly -- deals to Family Dollar and Family Dollar to deals certainly could be a part of the future also.","Anthony Chukumba","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful, thank you.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Charles Grom","Hey good morning guys, great quarter. Just at 2015 how should we think about puts and takes on the gross profit margin front and looking at even maybe into 2016 at what point do your lower energy cost start to help you guys out on the sourcing side.","Bob Sasser","Yes Chuck. I think as we look at it in 2015, we got -- thinking about the fact that as we said freight rates in general are going to continue to be higher for us in the sense that we took certain rate increases last year for certain distributions centers.","We have some distribution centers this year that will take rate increases as well. Obviously, the offset is -- partial offset is the fact that diesel is today running roughly $2.90 versus running I think last year in Q4 it was about $3.85. So it is down significantly, which is help to offset it.","Now I think we look at the fact that we want to continue to drive sales. You've seen the -- we had some great success this year with investing in some brand products that are wild valid items to our consumers, the brands they know, brands that they love to be able to get at that dollar price point and our merchants have done a great job of sourcing those items and putting them in.","So I think we're continuing to look better at driving sales and I think on an overall basis, next year I think again at a low-to-mid single digit comp, we would expect to see a little bit of leverage on occupancy as we have traditionally over the last few years.","So I think overall depending on where freight comes out, I think we\u2019re looking at gross profit flat and up or down 10 basis point discount where we think about it.","And again it\u2019s always about managing through the business, where there are items that are freights up, we got to find ways to offset that within our business model and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re always thinking about it.","Chuck Grom","Okay, that\u2019s great and then just a follow-up in light of the Wal-Mart news last week and even TJ Maxx this morning. I am just wondering if you guys still need to raise your wages for your associates to stay competitive and then if you factor any of that into your guidance for this year?","Bob Sasser","Well Chuck, we watch the industry trends carefully and of course we\u2019re compliant with all the State and Federal regulations, but I\u2019ll tell you, outside of complying with the continued changes in the regulations we\u2019ve made no plans for a sweeping change to our minimum wage rates, but we will continue to pay competitive wages market-by-market just as we always have done based on the prevailing rates.","And as always, we\u2019ll work very hard to offset any wage increases and cost increases and general through increased sales and productivity enhancing initiatives that we\u2019ve always been able to find.","Chuck Grom","Okay. Great. Good luck, guys. Thank you.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. First there was a slight change in the language around your comp guidance versus last few years. You've guided a low single this year, a range of low single to low single to mid.","Just wondering what drives that confidence in stronger sales growth this year. If you could just point to the factors that drive that. Thanks.","Bob Sasser","Well that's a very subtle change in the language, but I\u2019ll tell you, we factor in as always -- we factor in the guidance especially first quarter when you\u2019re looking out across the whole year of guidance.","And you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming at you, so you're always looking at what -- where the rocks in the road maybe. So you factor in what you know and what you could expect and what possibly could happen.","And when you throw that against how you feel about the strength of the business and the momentum that you have going into the year, and all the values that we know that we have planned -- the promotions that we have planned.","So I would tell you that if I could guess, you could read that as we\u2019re excited about our business. I can tell you that first quarter initiatives are more excited than they\u2019ve ever been, you've have heard me say that before.","But there really is an excitement about our business, our Dollar Tree business as we look forward into 2015. It's just the uncertainty out there. So what we've tried to do is more than -- sort of, what we\u2019ll try to do is to describe to you all the factors that we consider to go into our guidance.","And at the same time, we\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re absolutely positioned dead in the crosshairs of where the value customer and they're all value customers now, but where the value customer is going.","And we're more relevant than ever. I can\u2019t tell you that I can have empirical data, but the win fields are a little bit to our back in the value sector right now with lower gasoline prices and lower prices and lower diesel fuel prices and there is just a lot of lowers there that tend to help us as we accelerate our momentum going into the year.","That having said, we would be remiss if we didn\u2019t also point out the uncertainties that we see out there so. Our guidance is our guidance. I\u2019d like for you to believe it. I\u2019d like for you to -- I've always tried to earn credibility with our guidance and to factor in all that we know the best we can.","Matt Nemer","No, we\u2019re happy to see the mid single comment in there and then just secondly, following up on gross margin if we just isolate the freight related components Kevin, how do you think that that will play out in terms of just the driver shortage versus the gas price benefit and then I guess any port delay cost this year if we exclude investments in wild brands etcetera. How does that play out in 2015?","Kevin Wampler","I think just to give you some direction, so if we think about inbound and outbound rates and then there\u2019s obviously the fuel component. The actual inbound and outbound rates are probably about 80% of the overall cost with the fuel piece being about 20%.","So obviously as we've talked about rates going up, fuel being a smaller piece we're going down. So realistically if rates continue as we expect them, we\u2019ll not be able to offset all of that rate increase with the fuel decrease as we see it right now. So that\u2019s why we said within the guidance we project there will be headwinds from freight cost throughout the year.","Matt Nemer","Great. thanks so much.","Operator","And we have time for a few more questions. We\u2019ll go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Tiffany Kanaga","Hi this is Tiffany Kanaga on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question. Would you update us on your long-term store growth potential as a standalone entity and also as a combined one?","I know you outlined the 1,000 stores in Canada, but any additional color would be helpful?","Bob Sasser","Well we\u2019ve always for years and years, we've set 7,000 Dollar Tree stores and I think that we probably if we would update it today, we would say that that\u2019s probably on the low side.","But 7,000 Dollar Tree stores in the U.S. our Deals brand adds to that, we\u2019ve never quantified it, but our deals brand is in addition to the 7,000 Dollar Tree stores and in Canada a 1,000 Dollar Tree Canada stores is we feel very good about growing over time to a 1,000 stores in Canada.","The combined growth all I can tell you there so far since we've not closed on the Family Dollar deal is what\u2019s in the public documents out there, that you\u2019ve seen as well as everyone else I guess and at Family Dollar said I think 15,000 stores is their potential.","So if you take the 15,000 and add the 7,000 plus that are 23,000 stores sound like might be the right math on that. By the way, I think the combination of Family Dollar and Dollar Tree is I've said it before, it\u2019s complementary.","One does not trump the other. So we can't continue to grow the Dollar Tree brand in addition to growing the Family Dollar brand at the appropriate pace over time.","Tiffany Kanaga","Thank you so much. I appreciate it.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Yeah thanks. Good morning, Bob.","Bob Sasser","Good morning.","Dan Wewer","Following up on your comments on format optimization, do you think that the Family Dollar locations are sufficient that they could generate the same type of sales and profit productivity as a Dollar Tree and also if this will give Dollar Tree an opportunity to start going into smaller markets that historically you've sidestepped?","Kevin Wampler","Let me see if I've understood the question, but what we've done is on format optimization, we\u2019ve taken the Family Dollar locations and we\u2019ve run them through our real estate model as if we were looking for a new Dollar Tree store.","And our real estate model then predicts the success the productivity of that score format. We started with the lowest performing Family Dollar stores if we get only a 100, but it was 100s.","And we\u2019ve run those through our models to come up with the initial number of stores that would benefit we think from moving from a Family Dollar brand to the Dollar Tree brand now where the stores would be more productive and more profitable likely because they serve -- they\u2019re more focused on the appropriate customer.","Some of the Family Dollar stores that moved into the suburban markets over recent years are in that group. They don\u2019t they\u2019re quite as well into suburban markets. Dollar Tree does much better in the suburban markets.","So that\u2019s how we've looked at it. We haven\u2019t really looked the other way yet, because until we close, we won\u2019t have access to all of that data on the Family Dollar side to be able to run the Dollar Tree stores through the Family Dollar data.","Dan Wewer","But it's your thought that the underperforming Family Dollar stores and suburban locations Dollar Tree type locations could generate the Dollar Tree profit metrics?","Bob Sasser","Yes that\u2019s right that\u2019s exactly right.","Dan Wewer","Yeah that\u2019s great as there\u2019s a huge difference between the two. Kevin, a quick question for you, you talk about excluding acquisition cost in the guidance. Does that include excluding the interest expense related to the acquisition?","Kevin Wampler","Yes it is and so you would have seen for example in this quarter in the table the income statement. You saw in the adjustment column there was $45.8 million of interest related cost related to the financing that was excluded so yes.","Dan Wewer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question today from Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is [John] [ph] on for Dan. My question is on SG&A, it was flat for the quarter, despite the 5.6% comp increase driven higher -- by the higher incentive compensation.","So we\u2019re little bit surprised to see that as you guys look to next year, can you give us any guidance on where you see the comp leverage point particularly in the fourth quarter?","Kevin Wampler","Yeah I think one thing I would speak to as it relates to the fourth quarter is the fact that if you look at the quarter, we\u2019re comparing against last year, last year\u2019s comp, the year ago fourth quarter comp was 1.2%.","So obviously we underperformed -- obviously much of that was weather driven at that point in time, but it affected the incentive compensation line items. It was a benefit basically to the P&L. At the end of the day, this year we obviously over-performed.","So there is a dichotomy between the two quarters we\u2019re comparing at the end of the day from an SG&A standpoint. So I think that\u2019s the biggest driver of why we see that.","You would notice that for the year, we still leveraged SG&A by 40 basis points for the year on our 4.3% comp. So I don\u2019t think the leverage point necessarily has changed overall as it relates to SG&A.","I think it was much more of a comparability issue year-over-year for that quarter as it relates to incentive based comp.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then just one more question another question on gross margin, just regards to your strategy to invest more on merchandise, we were -- gross margin inched up a little bit this quarter.","So I\u2019m just kind of wondering if there\u2019s been a little bit of a shift in the strategy or is it just a smaller kind of component of the movement in gross margin now. How should we think about the -- your strategy and then investing in merchandise going forward?","Kevin Wampler","Well there are ebbs and flows, but what you saw there was a result of fourth quarter. Fourth quarter always has opportunities to show more value or higher margin products with more of the discretionary product.","Our discretionary product grew at a little faster rate than our consumer product in the fourth quarter for example. So, while we drove a terrific comp, we drove more of the comp with discretionary and variety product. So that's a good thing.","But I wouldn\u2019t read anything on to the annual numbers, as we\u2019ve always had the strategy of as we got better cost or better prices reinvesting some of that not taking straight into gross margin, but reinvesting it into more value for the customer.","And that\u2019s what you see when you see the consistency of our gross profit over the year. So no change in the strategy I think what you see in there is just the benefit of a terrific fourth quarter effort and initiative.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thanks and congrats on a great quarter.","Kevin Wampler","Well thank you. Are there any more questions.","Operator","And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Randy Guiler for any additional or closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Okay. And I just want to remind everyone that the guidance that we\u2019re providing for 2015 does not include any share repurchases. And thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree.","Our next quarterly earnings conference call is scheduled for Thursday, May 21.","Operator","Again that does conclude today\u2019s presentation.

Our call will be led by CEO, Bob Sasser, who will share insights on our business performance and initiatives.

Please limit your questions to one with one follow-up, if necessary.","I will now turn the call over to Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.","Bob Sasser","Thank you, Randy, and good morning, everyone. This morning we announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Same-store sales on a constant currency basis increased 3.4% in the quarter, driven by both increased traffic and increased average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the same-store sales increase was 3.1%.","Total sales grew 8.8% to $2.18 billion, operating income increased by $11.3 million or 4.9% and operating margin for the quarter was 11.2%, compared to 11.6% from the prior year's first quarter.","Net income increased 5.8% to $146.3 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 6% to $0.71, compared with first quarter 2014 earnings of $0.67 per diluted share.","First quarter results continue to validate the relevance of Dollar Tree. Customers are shopping with us more often. We are attracting new customers\u2019 everyday and when the customers are in the stores they are buying more. Comp sales for the quarter grew as a result of increases in both traffic and average ticket.","This was a unique quarter with several external factors impacting Dollar Tree and other retailers. In particular, a calendar shift with Easter falling two weeks earlier this year, we estimate the impact of the holiday calendar shift was a negative $8 million to sales and additionally, the recent west coast port slowdown increased in severity, it lasted longer than expected and it negatively impacted our earnings as higher margin import merchandise was delayed in getting to the stores.","This resulted in lost high-margin sales in the first quarter, incremental transportation and delivery costs per shipment that had to be diverted to alternate facilities and increased labor costs as stores managed uncertain product flow delivery schedules.","The good news is that we are reasonably caught up in the DCs, the merchandised floor of our imports coming through the west coast is more normalized, product is shipping to stores more efficiently and our customers are seeing fresh new high-value merchandise in the stores.","I am particularly proud of our merchandise, logistics and store teams who worked hard to execute the plan during this timeframe. Despite these challenges both sales and earnings were at the midpoint of our range of guidance for the quarter.","Dollar Tree continues to be part of the solution for millions of consumers as they strive to balance their household budgets. We serve our very loyal and growing customer base. Our commitment is to continue serving our existing customers better, while taking every opportunity to gain new customers in every store every day.","Our merchants do a great job sourcing product that exceeds customer expectations for what $1 can buy at a cost that fits our margin requirements and our store teams focus on providing a clean, fun and friendly shopping experience.","Customers know that when they pull into the parking lot at Dollar Tree everything is going to be priced at just $1 per item. Our merchandise values are better than ever and our operating margin continues to lead the discount retail sector.","First quarter same-store sales on a constant currency basis were solid at 3.4%, both traffic and average ticket increased and as expected March was our strongest comp month reflecting the Easter calendar shift. Adjusting for the holiday shift, same-store sales were relatively balanced by month throughout the quarter.","Sales performance across the home, seasonal and basics divisions were tightly grouped and our sales increase resulted from strength in both basic consumables and discretionary products with discretionary products leading the way.","Top-performing categories included party supplies, food and household products. Geographically, with the exception of our western zone, comp sales performance across the country was relatively consistent in the first quarter. Delayed receipts related to port congestion primarily impacted our western stores. Despite these challenges, our western zone still produce slightly positive same-store sales in the first quarter.","Seasonal energy was high throughout the quarter, beginning with Valentine's Day. In addition to party essentials, our stores were well stocked with cards, gifts, gift bags, balloons and candy for that special purpose or that special person. Seasonal sell-through was good and stores quickly and efficiently transitioned the St. Patrick's Day and Easter.","While the seasonal display showed red in February, they quickly turned green in early March with hats, necklaces, socks and party supplies for St. Patrick's Day. And for Easter, our customers found jellybeans, Easter bunnies, chocolate, candy baskets and basket stoppers, everything necessary to build colorful, cost-effective Easter baskets for the kids. And for the party planners, our high-value assortment of entertaining these, including baking products, plates, bowls, cups and napkins was well received.","We continue to invest in our customers by offering high-value product. In addition to the seasonal energy in first quarter, our President Day event emphasized unbelievable values on many name brand bonus buys, especially in our food, snack, beverage and household supplies. We offer tremendous values and all priced at one -- just $1 per item. And not to forget the basics throughout the quarter, we highlighted our million dollar brands with signing and special displays of these everyday items that provide great values to our customers, especially to meet their spring cleaning and spring decorating needs.","We ended the quarter with our inventory clean, well balanced and stores prepared for Mother's Day and Summer Fun. As we entered May in our fiscal second quarter, we\u2019ve been pleased with early sales and traffic trends.","Looking forward, we're positioned for increased relevance to our customer\u2019s sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our businesses through opening more stores, increasing the productivity of all of our stores and further developing our new formats, new markets and new channels of growth vehicles.","In the first quarter, we opened 93 new stores and we relocated and expanded 10 existing stores for a total of 103 projects. Total square footage increased 7.1%. We ended the quarter with 5,454 stores and we\u2019re on track with our plan for fiscal 2015, which includes 400 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 475 projects across the U.S. and Canada. As a reminder, square footage growth for the full year is planned to increase 7.2% over fiscal 2014.","In addition to new stores, we continue to execute our strategy to improve productivity of our existing stores. Some of our drive-the-business initiatives include first of all, our category expansions, where customers are realizing more value as we rationalize and expand assortments that supplies hardware, healthcare, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products.","Seasonal relevance is always important at Dollar Tree. Our store fronts change with the seasons. At Dollar Tree, we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point. Merchandise energy and the thrill of the hunt is throughout the store. At Dollar Tree, you always find an unexpected value. And being the first of the month already is important. We place special emphasis on basic consumable core items at the beginning of each month when many customers are shopping for basic needs.","Additionally, we are -- we're continuing the expansion of our frozen and refrigerated category. In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers and 96 additional stores. We currently offer frozen and refrigerated product in 3716 stores and were growing. Frozen and refrigerated merchandise is generally lower margin but it\u2019s fast returning, more frequently purchased and the increase in shopping frequency provides Dollar Tree the opportunity to drive incremental sales across all categories, including the higher margin discretionary product.","Most importantly, the product serves the needs of our customer. In addition to Dollar Tree stores in the U.S., Dollar Tree Canada and Deals are key brands in our portfolio and key components of our growth strategy. In the first quarter, we grew our store count in Canada by opening 10 new stores, bringing our Dollar Tree Canada store base to 218 stores. We\u2019re building the merchant and store teams in Canada to better serve the Canadian customer.","We\u2019re leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher value product and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Canada and we followed our strong Q4 performance with another solid quarter in Q1, growing comp sales through increases in both average ticket and transaction count.","We have significant growth potential in Canada. We\u2019re confident that Canadian market will support up to thousand Dollar Tree stores. And this is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of 125 Canadian, just as we are in the U.S. at the $1 U.S. price point.","Our Deals format further extends our ability to serve more customers. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point, it is providing the opportunity to serve more customers with more categories. Our Deal stores provide great values on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. The stores operate using a multi-price point strategy and have the potential to generate greater revenues with a higher average ticket. We concluded the first quarter with a total of 221 Deal stores.","In addition to Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and Deals, we\u2019re pleased with the growth and performance of our online business. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores.","For 2015, we have focused commitment, driving traffic to our website. In addition to creating brand awareness and brand advocacy, we're committed to driving sales to both our e-commerce division and our stores. In the first quarter, we saw more than 12 million visits to our website through desktops, laptops, pads and phones.","To help drive traffic to our site, we\u2019re employing a tremendous effort to reach out to existing and potential customers, using a variety of marketing mechanisms. These include e-mails, social media, search engine marketing, video marketing and our Value Seekers Club. In fact in Q1, we connected with 2 million customers via Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Pinterest.","These avenues enable us to better understand what our customers like, what they want and how we can serve them better. Additionally, we continue to utilize themes on our site to display our exciting lines of product to support events, whether the theme is Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Spring Clean or Summer Fun. We have great selections of products at tremendous values.","In April, we launched our graduation event, which runs through June. Our stores are well-stocked with the right colors to provide their customers with fantastic values for the graduation party needs.","Customers are using our store color finder tool on our website to quickly identify which of their local stores have their school colors. We recently distributed our Summer Catalog to more than 6,000 existing and potential customers. The catalog is chart full of amazing offers to provide customers with great summer items, all priced at just $1.","As technology evolves and markets change, our e-commerce team continues to have success and staying on point with our tech-savvy customers and connecting with them effectively and efficiently.","With multiple formats, inventory management is very important. It\u2019s something we watch carefully and our inventory continues to be extremely well managed and our turns continue to increase. In the past 12 months, we have run our store base by 7.4% and our overall inventory dollars have grown only 4.9%.","Our seasonal sell-through in first quarter was strong. Our basic in-stock was maintained and when the customers were shopping, our stores were ready to serve. Thanks to the efforts of our merchant, logistics and store teams, inventory turns increased for the quarter again and we're all well prepared to support second quarter 2015 sales plans.","As you know, we've always supported our plan growth with infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We are now in the final stages of determining the location for a new and an additional DC in the Southeast. We plan to break ground on DC 11 this year and have the facility online, up and running and operating in Q3 of 2016. And we will provide more details on this project as our plans are finalized.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our financial metrics and our outlook for 2015.","Kevin Wampler","Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our adjusted first quarter earnings increased 6% to $0.71 per diluted share. Once again, we're pleased with another quarter of strong same-store sales. Our constant currency of 3.4% comp sales performance was composed of a 2.1% increase in traffic and a 1.3% increase in average ticket.","Geographically, our sales performance was nicely balanced across the zones with the exception of the Western Zone as they experienced the majority of the port disruption impact. However, despite experiencing delayed shipments, our Western Zone still produced slightly positive same-store sales.","Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 34.4% during the first quarter, compared with 34.8% in the prior year's first quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to the following factors. Freight costs as a percent of sales increased as domestic trucking rates were higher. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel costs.","Additionally, we incurred added freight costs by rerouting some imports to alternate ports. Secondly, we incurred approximately 10 basis point unfavorable impacts related to the $2 million non-cash charge with the change in the inventory accounting method for our Canadian operations to conform Canada's policy to our U.S. policy. This chart was expected and disclosed in the guidance provided in February for the first quarter.","Trick results for the quarter also negatively impacted our margin results. Excluding acquisition-related costs, SG&A expenses were 23.2% of sales for the quarter, flat to as a percent of sales compared to the first quarter last year. Payroll related expenses increased 10 basis points for the quarter and store bonuses increased based on the company\u2019s sales performance and insurance costs related to health-care claims increased. These were partially offset by reduced store payroll due to improved productivity.","Depreciation expense decreased by approximately 10 basis points as a result of leverage from same-store sales increase. Adjusted operating income increased $11.3 million compared to the first quarter of last year and adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points compared to last year's company record first quarter operating margin of 11.2%.","Non-operating expenses for the first quarter increased $111.5 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the financing from our pending acquisition of Family Dollar. As projected, on our prior earnings call, our tax rate for the quarter was 38.4% versus 38.2% in the first quarter of last year. Looking at the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $870.4 million compared to $387.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015.","We also have restricted cash of $7.2 billion related to the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and Term Loan B for the Family Dollar acquisition. Proceeds are being held in an escrow account until the closing of the acquisition. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 4.9% greater than at the same time last year. Our selling square footage increased 7.1%.","Consolidated inventory per selling square foot decreased 2.1%. Our inventory turns increased in the first quarter and we expect continued improvement in inventory turns for the full year. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the second quarter.","Capital expenditures were $66.9 million in the first quarter 2015 versus $71.9 million in the first quarter of last year. For the full year 2015, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $465 million to $475 million. Capital expenditures will be focused on new stores remodels, including additional key development stores, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancements and the construction of our new Southwest Distribution Center.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $52.8 million for the first quarter versus $50.7 million in the first quarter of last year. For 2015, we expect depreciation and amortization to range from $250 million to $225 million. Our guidance for 2015 takes into account the actual performance in the first quarter and except for small refinements to the share count and the tax rate is unchanged from that which we issued on February 26.","It includes the following assumptions. First, we completed our May 1st, ocean freight negotiations with no material change from our prior assumptions. As always, we cannot predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that diesel prices will remain similar to the current levels on average throughout fiscal 2015.","We also cannot predict future currency fluctuations, so we\u2019ve not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.3% for the second quarter and 38.1% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 207.1 million shares for the second quarter and for the full year.","Sales and earnings per share outlook then for the second quarter are as follows. For the second quarter of 2015, we're forecasting sales to range from $2.17 billion to $2.23 billion and diluted earnings per share excluding acquisition-related costs in the range of $0.63 to $0.68, which would represent a 3% to 11% increase compared to the second quarter of 2014 earnings, excluding acquisition-related costs of $0.61 per diluted share. The sales range implies a low to low-mid single-digit comparable store sales increase and 8% percent square footage growth.","Additionally, we've not included any acquisition-related costs in the second quarter outlook as we cannot currently forecast the timing of when these costs will be incurred. Our outlook for the remaining three quarters remains unchanged. For the full fiscal year of 2015, we're now forecasting sales in the range of $9.24 billion to $9.42 billion based on a low to low-mid single-digit increase in same-store sales and 7.3% square footage growth.","Diluted earnings per share excluding acquisition-related costs are now expected to range from $3.32 to $3.47. This represents an increase of 6% to 11% over 2014 earnings per diluted share, excluding acquisition-related costs of $3.12.","I will now turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks Kevin. Before going to Q&A, I know that you all want to hear the latest news on our acquisition of Family Dollar. I hope you have seen the press release. In addition, I will tell you that the strategic rationale for the deal is more compelling than ever. We know much more now than we did 12 months ago and are even more enthusiastic about the long-term transformative nature of this transaction for Dollar Tree.","I know you are aware, this is an extremely large and complex transaction, involving more than 13,000 retail store locations. It is the largest of any previous retail merger. Needless to say, this process has taken longer than any of us anticipated. We\u2019re continuing to work very hard to close the transaction as soon as possible and our current expectation is that we can have this transaction completed in early July.","Throughout this lengthy process, we've continued with our integration planning. Our integration teams have developed the detailed strategies, objective and tasks with assigned milestones for achieving these tasks. We have great confidence in our opportunity and ability to achieve at least $300 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of year three.","These synergies will be achieved through a combination of both direct and indirect sourcing, banner optimization, also called rebannering, logistics and overhead. Our priority areas of focus will be on the customer, involving the merchandise assortment to increase value and better meet their needs. The customer experience in the stores, we want to create a more exciting, but customer friendly environment.","To do that, we\u2019re going to have to lower the field turnover, we\u2019re going to have to support the store initiatives and develop a more performance-based culture throughout the company.","And of course, we wanted to and are going to continuing to work very hard on plans to increase store productivity by modifying assortments to improve sales and inventory productivity, and existing stores, while improving new store remodeling expansion performance.","We plan to employ a disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined organization through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives.","We\u2019re confident that placing our initial emphasis in these areas can materially enhance operating performance of the Family Dollar brand through improvements in sales, margins, expense control and greater customer satisfaction.","Both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are ready to integrate. Our teams are incredibly excited about this opportunity to grow our business for the long term by adding the Family Dollar banner to the Dollar Tree portfolio of brands.","As always, we will manage this business with a focus on what is best for our stakeholders, including our customers, our vendor partners, our associates and importantly, our long-term shareholders.","I'm pleased with our position at Dollar Tree in the market as the leader in value retailing at the fixed price of $1. And I\u2019m incredibly excited about Dollar Tree's future. The Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever, providing extreme value to customers, while recording record levels of earnings. Our model has been tested by time and validated by history.","For 29 consecutive quarters, Dollar Tree has delivered positive same-store sales increases through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value, no matter the state of the economy.","Our operating margin continues to lead the discount sector. We remain committed to the concept our customers love and we're positioned for continued profitable growth for many years ahead. We have a talented management team that has a long history of retail success.","And importantly, we look forward to welcoming the Family Dollar organization into our company. With the addition of Family Dollar, we will be a bigger, stronger and more diversified business, better able to serve more customers and more markets, with exactly what they're looking for great value. It's a great time to be Dollar Tree. Our inventories are clean and fresh. The shelves are full of the right product and our values have never been better.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First, we\u2019ll go to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all the color on the port, but is there any way to quantify the impact more specifically on comps and margins or even relative to the Easter shift?","Bob Sasser","It\u2019s hard to quantify the exact impact. We\u2019ve looked at it seven different ways and there is always this and that and the other. But the evidence is there that our West Coast stores underperformed.","We did, we scrambled all quarter really starting last year, but it got a little more severe in first quarter. We did all the things that we were able to do as far as shipping merchandise earlier to get it into the stores earlier. We used alternate ports. We use different modes of transportation once we got into those ports to get it to the right place and we just scrambled all quarter, which with effect to us, we actually had our Easter product in and our Valentines product in.","But it was all the other things that all the basics that we import, the housewares and all the textile and all those apparel items for the upcoming summer season and all those things that were slow in getting in. And then of course, once they hit the Coast, as you know, they were just anchored out there lots of ships anchored with lots of containers.","They continued to unload but it was slower and all the freight that was coming into those West Coast ports starting backing up, which made it even more complex. We were negatively impacted in multiple ways, first of all, toplines fails, especially in the West Coast stores and it was the higher margin product that was delayed, it was our import. So topline sales were impacted, margin was impacted, freight, we spent more money on transportation and we had more cost as product was rerouted to alternate ports.","And then of course, the disruption in the stores as the store teams had planned to set whatever product or whatever promotion, it was just always came, but it was late and the timing was off, which made our stores really work a lot harder.","There was more uncertainty in unloading the product when the product was coming in and getting it on the shelf. So all of that together, it\u2019s just really hard to put your figures out. We\u2019ll tell you that we finished, we still with the disruption. We still hit the midpoint of our range of guidance on sales and earnings. If not for the port disruption, it would've been better.","Stephen Grambling","And so I guess, as we look forward as a related follow-up, did the port disruptions actually open up some opportunities for some excess product that you could potentially buy and some of these better values and position you better as you look forward. And we\u2019d already seen some of these in the stores. So I guess the question also is how many more opportunities are there to expand those better value products across the chain? Thanks.","Bob Sasser","That\u2019s a good point. I mean, we work --look at that all the time. We work on it everyday. We have a part of our organization focused on just that opportunity all the time taking advantage of product that is maybe a little this late or could be -- for all the reasons, the product maybe distressed and we could buy it even cheaper and offer greater values to our customers. So that opportunity is there. We intend to continue to take advantage of that.","But most importantly, for the most part this port issue is behind us. And as we entered second quarter, it\u2019s early in second quarter, we were able to sell our Mother\u2019s Day product. We had really, really nice Mother's Day sell-through, so it\u2019s nice performance in our stores for Mother's Day product. We\u2019re seeing new product on the shelf. When our customers come in now, they\u2019re seeing all the things that we expected them to see that we wanted them to see and they're reacting pretty well to it. So we're pleased to be past. Best news about the port slowdown is we\u2019re pretty much past it.","Stephen Grambling","Sounds good. Thanks so much. I will jump back in the queue.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we will hear from Meredith Adler, Barclays.","Sean Kras","I\u2019m Kras on for Meredith. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering, if you guys are seeing any changes in the competitive environment and some competitors are adding slow labor? I\u2019m wondering if this is something that maybe you\u2019re considering for some stores.","Bob Sasser","Well, two questions. First of all, I\u2019ll help in there, but competition is always there, the retail is extremely competitive, always have been. We complete with the very wide array of retailers. I really can\u2019t tell you that I\u2019m seeing anything extra special. It seems like it\u2019s always been competitive to me. Our focus continues as always been and will continue to be on our business.","First and foremost, what can we do better to survive customers? We shop other retailers. We watch what they are doing. We strive to be proactive and not reactionary to what others are doing. That said, we're not seeing, I don't see any significant changes in the overall competitive landscape. It's always been very competitive.","As to the -- I think you talked about the minimum wage and the hourly rates. We watch the industry trends carefully, and of course we\u2019re compliant with all the state and federal regulations, those are changing. We are watching them. We are responding appropriately to those.","Our goal is to pay a competitive wage by market in order to fill our workforce needs based on the fulfilling rates. We made no plans for a sweeping change to our minimum wage rates. As always, we\u2019ll work very hard to be competitive around the rates while working to offset cost increases in general through increased sales and productivity initiatives.","Sean Kras","Thanks for that. And just to clarify, just it seems like you\u2019re not contemplating, actually adding more incremental labor to stores, but obviously -- thoughts on actually wages themselves. But just no anticipated changes in actual amount of labor is what you\u2019re saying?","Bob Sasser","Probably not in the way you're thinking.","Sean Kras","Okay.","Bob Sasser","We've always ramped our stores labor to the sales. So when you say are planning to add any more labor to stores, we\u2019re planning to increase sales or decrease sales. We will continue to manage our labor and our payroll to match those sales, that sales component. But we have no initiative, like we\u2019ve seen maybe in some other retailers to just ramp up carte blanche across the board.","Sean Kras","Thanks, Bob. I appreciate. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Bob Sasser","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Next we will hear from Scot Ciccarelli, RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys.","Bob Sasser","Good morning.","Scot Ciccarelli","Can you give us an idea of how big your Western division is and maybe the magnitude of performance that that experience first maybe the other division?","Bob Sasser","I can give you the first part of the question. If you look at just the West Coast DCs and the store service data there, it\u2019s about 30% and it changes throughout the season and month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, but just for the most part around 30%.","If you add in the Texas distribution, Oklahoma distribution center it goes up to 38% to 40%, something like that. As a percentage of our product of imports that are coming through, I think that's what you are allude -- I believe that\u2019s what you're trying to get.","Scot Ciccarelli","Absolutely, Bob. And was the Texas DC also impacted?","Bob Sasser","Absolutely. Matter of fact, they may have been the most highly impacted because once we got it unloaded the snarl unloaded and got possession of the goods. The Texas, D.C. product then has to go on rail. And by the way, lots of people were trying to do the same thing and then there was a shortage of rail cars. And it was the usual debacle that creates when everybody is looking for the same commodity at the same time. So, frankly, the Texas, D.C. has been the last one to recover, I guess from the snarl that we had from the West Coast port strike.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you. So in other words, 40% of your sale, as much as 40% of sales were kind of impacted by this port strike as well as the mix of product. That\u2019s helpful. And when did inventory flows start to normalize?","Bob Sasser","It was actually -- just to clarify, 40% of our imports are coming through the West Coast and Oklahoma. So, as the imports are maybe 40% of our sales, 40% of our merchandise for that period of time was disrupted slowdown and entangled. When did it mitigate? Just recently, I would say end of April, first of May, that we start thinking that it's just mopping up around the edges, as far as getting the product into the stores, so really just recently.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you. All right. Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Next, we will go to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Thanks. Bob, just wondered, any change to the focus to the margin trends. And if you could talk about two of their pressure point south one, the higher freight costs? Is that a longer term issue with driver wages that will persist for the next couple of years? And then also surprised that shrinkage rate is higher, given that the inventory per square foot has actually reduced year-over-year. I would think that would create pure opportunities for shrink?","Kevin Wampler","Yeah. Dan, this is Kevin. In regards to the first part of your question of freight costs, we do expect freight costs to be a headwind as we go through the year. And it\u2019s not only the driver piece of it, but it's also the fact that as we went through the economic down cycle, there are many less firms out there today, trucking firms and so the competition has gotten less in some respects.","And I think the trucking industry is taking a different view of understanding the lane. Certain lanes need to be profitable. And so we looked at their model to make sure that it made sense. So there has been pressure on overall basis so. We started seeing that in the second half of last year and lot of that was driver related but some of it was again, just the firms themselves. And so we again, we expect to see that throughout the year and it is built into our guidance.","As far as it relates to shrink, it has been a little bit tougher start of the year for shrink than we had anticipated. The loss prevention team in the stores are very focused on it. As always anything that we always view that things that we focus on, we could make changes to it and affect and so that's our focus right now. And I wouldn\u2019t disagree with your concept of the fact that less inventory should make it a little easier to protect it. So it\u2019s a little bit of a trend that we didn't anticipate, but we are very focused on getting it corrected going forward.","Dan Wewer","Okay. And just as a follow-up on the closing of the Family Dollar transaction. I guess it\u2019s what is third and fourth, can you tell us why the closing has been delayed? Is it solely finding buyers for the divested stores that meet the FTC approval? Is that the only hang-up or there are some other topics with the acquisition that's creating the delays?","Kevin Wampler","Dan, look, we\u2019re as anxious to get this thing done as you can imagine. It's not what you said. It is more than just a large and complex transaction involving 113,000 stores. So the largest effect I believe is the largest retail merger in the United States ever. So it\u2019s large, it\u2019s complex. We\u2019re making progress. We will continue to provide updates in a public fashion as we\u2019re able to do so.","What we gave you this morning is where we are now. We have clarity. It\u2019s 330 Family Dollar Stores that we will be divesting, representing about $45.5 million of operating income. The company intends to reach an agreement with the divestiture buyer in the coming days and secure the FTC clearance thereafter","And we intend to close the proposed merger in early 2015. I know you\u2019ll understand that this is all rolling around just a subject to confidentiality that we could close. It\u2019s possible that we could close in late June but early July. It\u2019s what we are saying is more likely. We\u2019ll continue to provide updates in a public fashion as we are able to.","Dan Wewer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll hear from Laura Champine, Cantor Fitzgerald.","Laura Champine","Thanks Bob and congratulations on continued growth in your business today. But can you talk about, once this merger does close where do you think the revenue synergy opportunities would be, if any or if I should be asking this differently? What do you think is the potential for cannibalization when Family Dollar and Dollar Tree combine?","Bob Sasser","One of the really exciting things about this combination is that it is complementary. We are side-by-side now as a matter of fact in many places and many cases, we aspire to different customers and we aspire to different real estate. But we are both large companies and there are instances now where we have Family Dollars and others in most cases, frankly within a few miles of us. When we open a new store is my understanding and what I believe is it doesn't really impact the Family Dollar business.","When Family Dollar opens new store near us, I can tell you, it does not materially impact our Dollar Tree business. We exist very well together as far as serving different customer needs, different products and for different reasons.","So we are complementary in real estate, we are complementary in customers. We aspire to more of the suburban customer although we have some of all. We aspire to the suburban customer. The Family Dollar model aspires to that urban lower income customers and lower customer. So these two companies just did incredibly well together as the opportunity is there to grow both banners to put the right store in front of the right customer. We have tremendous room for growth at Dollar Tree. We\u2019ve got over 5000 stores now. We have for years been saying we could have 7000 Dollar Tree stores. It\u2019s probably more than that. We just need to remodel it.","And on the Family Dollar side, I\u2019d only know what I\u2019ve read and what you've read but they have over 8,000 stores. And they\u2019ve said in their public comments that they could have 12,000. So we believe that that is still there to be done. We believe that through the combination we can leverage the size and scale of our buying power. We know that there are synergies and cost of goods sold as we combined these companies. We know there are many back office synergies and savings that we can have. We know that there is huge opportunity -- combined we have billions of dollars of spend on indirect product things that we\u2019d buy for, not for resale. So with that size of an opportunity together, we expect that we will get better cost, more efficiencies and improve the overall business of both companies.","So it\u2019s just a huge opportunity that\u2019s transformational. This is the one opportunity where you put the two together, one plus one does equal two points something. One does not take away from the other from the customer\u2019s point of view.","Laura Champine","And Bob, if I can have a follow-on. So are there items, strong items that Dollar Tree sells and that everything for $1 world view that you can add to Family Dollar Stores that should actually drive better results in sales per square foot for Family Dollar Stores?","Bob Sasser","Well, there\u2019s certainly things that we carry in our Dollar Tree stores that could be added. The way we are looking at this though is we are looking at the floor plan first. And we are looking at productivity, both sales and margin productivity by department. So it is started at the higher-level and you are looking at where you are most productive departments. So I think we drill down to the categories and we are doing the same thing. Now we are doing this through a clean room now. So I don\u2019t have access, direct access to all the details of cost of things. But we have through our clean room, we can get the information we can get enough feedback to know that what we are thinking is right or directionally right.","But its first about the floor plan, what do you want to show the customer, where\u2019s the opportunity to serve the customer better. By expanding this category, can we improve sales throughput and margin throughput in our Family Dollar Stores. Then the real power of this is the combination of the two companies and the buying power of each. So even if we don't sell the same item, we are dealing with the same categories. In Dollar Tree, we have the same departments, we have the same vendor base, we deal with the same vendors. It\u2019s just that we buy different items in many cases.","So leveraging these common vendor relationships with a larger size and larger scale, we believe can be more productive and more efficient for the vendor base. And that should turn into better prices for the combined Family Dollar and Dollar Tree. We already know we've been doing a lot of work. We already know there\u2019s huge synergies and exact items and both sell that we can get lower costs on. One of us has a lower cost than the other now.","So we know what that is. And then there's the similar items where it\u2019s not exactly the same item but it's a similar item .It maybe a four packet Dollar Tree. It might be a eight packet Family Dollar but it\u2019s the same item with a different put-up in the same vendor. The idea of going out to bid or working with those vendors to get the best price for the total company is a powerful synergy that we have and one that we intend is begin leveraging on day one.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Moving on to Michael Lasser, UBS.","Michael Lasser","Thanks Bob for taking my question. I know this has been asked few different ways but maybe you could just tell us what you think the quantitative impact both of your sales into your margin from the West Coast port slowdown? I think you multiply 16% of your import sales times assuming it\u2019s couple of 100 basis points lower in those categories and those stores that would be a 30 to 40 basis point overall impact to your sales. Is that in the right ballpark?","Bob Sasser","I would tell you this is anecdotal. I'm not -- this is not the math that you just did but anecdotally I think it was more than what you just said, not different by DC, it\u2019s different by market, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s different. And by the way you had the impact that when we knew that there was going to be a problem, we started shifting things and we started changing the playing field.","So that it just became hard to quantify exactly I\u2019d love to do that for you. We attempted to do it and at the end of the day, we said well it\u2019s a really lot of judgment here and what sales trend were these store on before and what sales trend were they then and what sales trend are they now, how much of those are external factors, how much are created by the port strike. And it\u2019s just complex. So we chose to not quantify it. I will tell you we hit the midpoint of our guidance on sales and earnings. Without the West Coast port strike, it would've been better than that on both lines. Your math is one way of doing it. I would think that it would actually be my opinion more of an impact than what you just penciled down.","Michael Lasser","And on the margin side, it\u2019s going to impact both the cost of goods and SG&A?","Bob Sasser","Cost of goods and transportation and SG&A in those stores. If you can imagine, you\u2019re ready to set and planning to set a certain promotion throughout the store. And some of that product then is not going to be available for two weeks or more, let\u2019s say. So scrambling to set something else in those locations by those stores, that\u2019s more costs. And then when the goods comes in two weeks later, you got to change those displace, take that product off, but on what was supposed to be there, put that product off.","So it just affects the whole supply chain when things get off to that magnitude. It is always something late. It\u2019s always something early. We deal with that at retail and we deal with that all the time and we deal with it very well all the time. This was unusual though. This was major ports in the country just really slowed down and it\u2019s narrowed up not only our break, but everybody else\u2019s which put pressure on the whole supply chain then.","I said then there was a shortage of railcars. So it delays because of that getting product into the right place, just managing all that became as much as it. So it affected our sales, it affected our margins because it was the high margin product. It affected our SG&A because we spent more on transportation and we spent more in the stores to accommodate these norms.","Michael Lasser","I know these are more shorter-term oriented questions, but I think it\u2019s important. My last one is you mentioned that you have been pleased with what you\u2019ve seen in May so far. So presumably you\u2019re not going to be pleased with something that\u2019s lower than what you experienced all in, in the first quarter. Is that fair?","Bob Sasser","Let me just say this, I mean we\u2019ve given you guidance now for second quarter and for the year basically other than changing for the actual first quarter results. The rest of the year forecast is all but the same. There is a shared account changes and things like that, but tax rate changes maybe. But basically the guidance remains the same that we gave you recently for the rest of the year.","So I will tell you that it\u2019s early on in the first quarter. So it\u2019s hard to declare a victory right now, but we feel like we started off where we needed to start. We had a good Mother\u2019s Day. We\u2019re pleased with our Mother\u2019s Day sales. We had good response from our customers and the new merchandise as they saw it getting the counter. Some of these summer merchandise in the west that finally got onto the counter as the customers are loving it, so they are seeing new product and that always creates good sales trends.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Great. Thank you so much. And best of luck with post-merger.","Bob Sasser","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time we have time for a couple more questions. Next we will hear from Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.","Charles Grom","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the last question, Bob. Is it safe to say that those stores on the West Coast are trending closer to the company average at this point in time?","Bob Sasser","I don\u2019t work it out that close for, I can\u2019t, but I will tell you that the new merchandise is having an impact and everything is improving on the West Coast and also in the Oklahoma, Texas stores that were serviced from the West Coast and the port.","Charles Grom","Great. And then just a two-part question on the Family Dollar side. So I am wondering if you could give us some quantification of how many stores you think you could look to rebanner, which obviously could be a big opportunity. And then from sales per square foot perspective clearly Family Dollar\u2019s lag Dollar General by a wide margin for 5 to 7 years now. And wondering if you could opine on why you think that gap exists and how quickly do you think you can raise that sales per square foot level over the next three years? Thanks.","Bob Sasser","Well, starting with the rebannering opportunity, I will tell you that one of the ones that\u2019s probably one of the biggest opportunities we have. I have not quantified the exact number of stores for anyone because it\u2019s still changing. But I have said, there are hundreds of opportunities to improve the productivity through a rebanner strategy. Again, we see this one of the large opportunities as we get the right banner in front of the right customers, the appropriate customers for that banner. It\u2019s an opportunity also to take a less productive store and quickly improve the productivity.","The process is going to go something like this. Upon completion of the transaction, we are planning to quickly rebanner a small group of test stores to verify that our analysis is correct and that our procedures are efficient and that we are touching the right things in the right order. We are going to closely track that, analyze it, and if necessary modify processes at that time for again efficiency and then proceed to rebanner additional stores and ways.","All of our initial rebanners are going to be Family Dollar\u2019s to Dollar Tree\u2019s ones we closed and we have complete access to the Family Dollar real estate information and their predicted model. We will run the same process on Dollar Tree stores to determine if some of them would be more productive as Family Dollar Stores. And my point of view is that there will be some that should go the other way, but ultimately our strategy will be to have the banner in each market that best serves the customer of that market and provide the credits earned on investment.","Second part of that question was sales per square foot, Family Dollar versus the lagging of sales per square foot, well, look, it\u2019s I think as we\u2019ve gone through there is a couple of big issues. First of all, there is the real estate strategy in our opinion and what we\u2019ve seen is the move more towards the suburban markets has not been as good. The Family Dollar Stores tend to be more productive and there is urban and rural market.","And I think again sort of with the merchandise mix going a little more suburban and little bit away from the diversity customer, the diverse customer, that low income customer, they have already identified and announced that their high-low strategy was not working. And the Family Dollar management team rightfully in our opinion chose to go back to an everyday low price strategy and they have seen some -- by their reports they have seen some good results from that. And by the way I think that\u2019s the right action, especially with that low income customer they serve.","So why is the sales per square foot lagging, well I believe they\u2019ve gotten away from their customer. I believe by getting back to that lower income customer, owning those opening price points that those customers need, the products merchandise, allocation of space in their stores and providing better opening price points and better merchandising strategy as far as price points, named brand private label, how do you offer the most value to the customer, expanding the floor plans, expanding those departments that those customers respond more to and shrinking the ones that they don\u2019t.","So that\u2019s it. I believe it\u2019s retailing one-on-one. Honestly, I am not trying to make it sound simple because there is a lot of stores and there is a lot of geography and there is a lot of diversity and there is a lot of competition, all the things that we face as retailers nothing is ever simple. But it is very clear to me the missteps and why they are lagging and it is very fixable in my mind. They have already begun some of it and I think we will absolutely bring more power to that.","Charles Grom","Great. Thanks very much. And good luck.","Bob Sasser","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we will hear from Paul Trussell, Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. Bob, I appreciate all the color you\u2019ve provided on the call today. Just following up on Chuck\u2019s question around rebannering, where does the deals format fit into your thought process, and also if you can kind of give us some color on how those might multi price point stores perform this quarter? Also as you think about your Canada operations, is Family Dollar an opportunity for rebannering or opening up stores in that market? And also when it comes to your store growth going forward, obviously, 7% year-over-year square footage growth for the Dollar Tree banner, how should we think about the growth potential for the combined entity?","Bob Sasser","You\u2019ve exceeded my ability to remember all those questions, but let me start with the few that I can remember, while they are all good questions. Deal$, we have great excitement around our Deal$ brand. We built it from beginning. Organically we bought a company called Deal$ from SuperValu which was mostly a single price point company and we have transformed it into a multi-price point banner that sells. We have lived through the restriction of price point to sell more products and more assortments and serve more customers.","We like where we are with that. At Deal$ everything is not dollar but everythings a value. The mix in the Deal$ store is a little -- it is not exactly like our Family Dollar Store. It is a little more discretionary product whereas Family Dollar is 70% plus percent consumer products, Deal$ is more like 60% consumer products, so it\u2019s more of 60%, 40% split.","We think the Deal$ brand has made some inroads into the suburban markets with multi-price point strategy and we think the acquisition and merger of Family Dollar will just only help that.","Now, down line, I can\u2019t tell you that Deal$ location here or there. There's 200 plus Deal$ stores, I can\u2019t tell their location here or there, might not change to any of the others, but that's not contemplated at this point in time. It is -- my goal is to continue to build the Deal$ brand at this point.","Family Dollar in Canada, I think, Family Dollar would be terrific in Canada. I think the Canadian market would respond very well to another a value -- multi-price point value retailer like Family Dollar.","So down line, over the course of the future, at some point, we will consider aiming that. Right now, as you know, you know this, we are focused -- we are laser focus on closing the deal and integration. And we need to get the companies integrated, we need to get infrastructure reallocated, we need to get the merchandise mix reassorted, we need to get the customers reengaged, we need to do a lot of things with the integration.","So anything that we would do with Family Dollar in Canada would come more than three years out, probably, some time off into the future, we are going to stay focused on integration and the combination as long as we need to.","Kevin Wampler","7% growth?","Bob Sasser","7% growth, I am not sure what your question was there but\u2026","Paul Trussell","Just commenting on the square footage growth of the combined entity, will you be opening, you said you will initially convert or rebanner some Family Dollars\u2019 into Dollar Tree as a test, will you continue the store opening plan that Family Dollar has initially outlined?","Bob Sasser","We will continue to open up new Family Dollar Stores. It will be, I think, they've already pulled back from their original plan. I'm not really sure on that. It basically you have got to ask them on that right now, we don't own the company. But I believe they pull back on where they were at their high store openings, for sure.","They reduced their new store opening, not because there's not plenty of room for them, but because as I looked at their business they weren\u2019t happy as we wouldn\u2019t be happy with the productivity of those new stores and they were pulling back as they were read -- viewing their strategy again, changing low price, reassorting the stores to the large degree.","And so, two questions there, one is, I will try to answer, that the near-term, I believe the Family Dollar brand, we will continue to open new stores, but it will be at a reduced rate, would be our plan for the near-term.","For the long-term, there are huge opportunities for growth in the Family Dollar brand and again, I believe the management team there had said potential for 12,000 Family Dollar Stores in the U.S. and I think that's probably right.","Alongside, growing our Dollar Tree, we are not changed our Dollar Tree growth, our square footage or square footage growth strategy. Now we will have to take a look at the how many stores can you rebanner and how many stores can you open, and how many stores should you open at one time.","As always, we will do this very methodically and very thoughtfully and we will do this efficiently as possible. We\u2019ve driven more by doing it right than by the numbers. But anecdotally, I am not looking to pull back the growth on Dollar Tree.","Paul Trussell","And just lastly, a quick P&L question for Kevin. As we look to the second quarter going forward, there was a negative impact from the opening of the Windsor DC I believe in 2Q last year? How should we think about gross margins as you lap that, should there be a favorable bounce here in this upcoming period and what comp do you need to produce SG&A leverage in the next quarter and the second half?","Kevin Wampler","Yeah. As it relates to the Windsor DC, we actually open that in June of 2013, so it\u2019s been almost two years now. So, again, it does, we did take a hit back at that point in time and sell that for the better part of the year, that DC continues to become more efficient as we continue to add stores to it. It opened up, obviously, with less than a full load of what its capacity with ramped up overtime and it\u2019s probably has a little bit more capacity left.","So, again, we are always looking to get more efficiency out of our distribution centers, but that\u2019s necessarily I don\u2019t feel like there is a large benefit coming in the second quarter because of that. And then as far as the second part of your question, all related to what comp does it take to leverage SG&A, I mean, I think, historically we\u2019ve said a two to three comp will typically get us some leverage, a little leverage, it did not this quarter.","I think if you go back a year ago in Q1, we had 2% comp and we have 40 basis points of leverage on SG&A. So as I\u2019ve stated before, it ebbs and flows, depending on what\u2019s going on in the business and what kind of initiatives we may or may not be driving through the company. So I still think that roughly 3% comp is -- 2% to 3% comp is a reasonable range to think about as far as leveraging SG&A.","Paul Trussell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Dan Binder, Jefferies.","Dan Binder","Hi. Good morning.","Bob Sasser","Good morning.","Dan Binder","I just had a question, as it pertains to the integration process. So I think back to your Canadian acquisition, as I recall, there was little bit of bumpiness early on in the integration. I\u2019m just curious if you could refresh our memories on what those issues were, what your learnings were and how you can apply that to the Family Dollar integration?","Bob Sasser","Well, fair question. I will tell you that it was a much smaller acquisition but it was the total -- it was a whole new country and it wasn\u2019t 51st state. Canada is clearly a different country, regulatory requirements, culturally, language. Believe it or not duplicate labels or languages on your labels, there is a lot of intricacies in entering Canada. Though we handled most of them fairly well, the big challenge that we\u2019ve had in Canada in my opinion is first of all, even though people, you would think would be aware of the brand is we had no brand density.","So we rebranded our -- branded all those stores early on to Dollar Three Canada from Dollar Giant. And because we think our Giant had any brand equity either. We built more stores and as we\u2019re getting more, more market density, we are building brand awareness. And we're seeing some of that improvement now. So that's one of the things.","Secondly, we had to build brand new management team and Canadian merchants and get that in place. So as always, the devil is in the details and most of the time it\u2019s people -- people, culture. Family Dollar is not a different country but it\u2019s a different -- little different cultures, different concept and we have to be very -- we have worked very -- together very well.","This is one of the learnings that I would say on any acquisition we\u2019ve ever done, it really comes down to the people and the culture and the motivation. To that -- having said that, I really have great admiration for the Family Dollar organization, what they do, they do some things much better than we do and we see that and we are happy to join in on the things that they do better. And there's some things that we think we can lent to the Family Dollar team also and they\u2019ve been very open to anything that we talk about so far.","They still run their own business, we don\u2019t own the business yet. But in our discussion, pre-integration discussion, we\u2019re always talking about those types of things and cultural things and how do we benefit from the combination and where's the opportunity to reduce costs, increase margin and drive sales.","So we are at one mind of that but that that's really the big learning, I guess. And over my history and years of doing this, we've done several acquisitions, I\u2019ve always asked other people to do acquisitions. So tell me one thing, we ought to be very careful of and it's always the people. It\u2019s always about culture. It's always about combining a diverse organization, a different organization. There are egos involved that have to be respected. And of course, everybody has a role in getting everybody pool in together.","So we're aware of those things. I think we're going to be just fine as long as we stay aware of it. I've shared this with our management team and with our organization. And by the way, I\u2019ve also shared that we own that part, not the Family Dollar people. We own the concept of bringing them in with respect and respecting what they've done and what they built over 50 some years, building that brand, the infrastructure that they\u2019ve built, that is very strong and very solid, the organization that they built, the technology that they\u2019ve built, the process and procedures. So it\u2019s up to us to engage with them and to bring these two cultures together.","Dan Binder","And just as a follow-up, I was curios. You talked a lot of about operational improvement. How do you feel about price reinvestment, just trying to reconcile your earlier comments about benign pricing environment, yet their results have been still little bit soft? Do you think there is a need for further price investment to get those sales per square foot up?","Bob Sasser","No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as that. I think it\u2019s a little bit of that. It\u2019s a little bit of this. But it\u2019s more about the merchandise assortment. There are many ways to bring value to a customer, especially a low income customer. What they -- what a low income customer needs maybe not the same as someone with a higher income level and what I mean by that is, as we go through the assortments, there is price competitiveness. We would intend to be competitive in the market on all the name brands, on all the same items, that sort of cost a poker.","If you are going to be in this business, you have to be competitive on the name brands and the same items. I think there is an opportunities for product development. They have some pretty good private-labels already. I think there is probably more room for that and rationalizing the assortment so that every item has a place. Every item has a mission. What\u2019s the value statement and the category? And is it good, better, best, is it private-label versus name brand, is it twice as much for the same price or is it the same amount for half the price?","I think more attention to opening price points. A customer that has limited income may want that biggest package of the name brand but they may be very competitive but from same price anyway. But you may just not have that much money in your pocket. So, you may also have to have an option for that customer that says it may not be the name-brand but it\u2019s a big jug of whatever it works. We stand behind the quality and all that goes with that.","So it\u2019s not as simple as just say price reinvestment. I believe we can lower retails and improve margins. But having said that, I\u2019m talking about the mix right way. And we are going to be very focused on that customers, especially that low income customer, what they need, what the price points are that really motivate them, how do we deliver value overall with a combination of name-brands, private-labels and then also discretionary products. I believe that people -- even if you are four years, you don\u2019t want to feel four. You walk into the store.","You are in a shopping environment that you are happy with, that respects you as a human being and offers you the things that you need. So, a lot of effort is going to be focused on the store and on the customer from day one. And we will invest, I would say more than price investment. I would say investment in the stores is where we are going to be really focused.","Now, we are going to have to pay for that somehow. There is no free investment. So, we are going to have to look really hard that where we can find the synergies and the opportunity to reduce costs in order to reinvest in the stores. Some of it maybe price. Some of it maybe anything, increases the value to that customer. It might be the shopping experience too and I believe there is big opportunity in that.","Dan Binder","Great. Thank you.","Bob Sasser","Welcome.","Operator","And thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mr. Guiler for any additional or closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Thank you, Amy.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President Investor Relations, Mr. Tim Reid. Please go ahead.","Timothy J. Reid","Good morning. Thank you [Levi] and welcome to the Dollar Tree conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. My name is Tim Reid, I\u2019m Vice President of Investor Relations for Dollar Tree.","Our call today will be led by Bob Sasser, our Chief Executive Officer, who will provide insights on our performance in the quarter and recent developments in our business. Kevin Wampler, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2014.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors included in our most recent press release, most recent current report on Form 8-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of which are on file with the SEC.","We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements and you should not expect us to do so. At the end of our planned remarks, we will open the call to your questions, which we ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up question if necessary.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Sasser, CEO of Dollar Tree. Bob?","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone. This morning, we announced our results for the first quarter 2014. Comp store sales on a constant currency basis increased 2% in the quarter, driven primarily by increased traffic with a small increase in average ticket. Adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the comp store sales increase was 1.9%. This was on top of a 2.1% comp in the first quarter of last year and a 5.6% comp the year before.","Total sales grew 7.2% to $2 billion. Operating income increased by $15.4 million or 7.1%. Operating margin was 11.6% matching last year\u2019s all time high first quarter operating margin. Net income increased 3.6% to $138.3 million and earnings per share increased 13.6% to $0.67 compared with first quarter 2013 earnings of $0.59 per share.","We believe that our model is right for all times. We offer the customer a balanced mix of consumable merchandise they need every day alongside assortments of high value seasonal and basic discretionary product and all at $1.","Our sales growth in the first quarter was the result of increased sales in both consumable and discretionary products with our seasonal and discretionary product growing at a slightly faster rate as planned. Top performing categories included candy, check-out and trend products, stationery, Valentines and Easter seasonal merchandise and frozen and refrigerated products.","As was the case in the fourth quarter, we were not immune to the impacts of the unusually long and harsh winter; weather impeded customer traffic well into March, created snarls in our merchandise flow and resulted in higher than planned freight, logistics and utility costs. It\u2019s not surprising then that in terms of geography performance in the first quarter was strongest in the southern zones led by the Southwest and the Southeast followed closely by the Midwest. Our performance was weaker in the Northeast.","Sales strengthened throughout the quarter with our strongest comps in April reflecting the Easter calendar shift and our strong Easter seasonal performance. We ended the quarter with increasing sales momentum that has continued into May.","Looking forward, we're positioned for continued relevance to the customer, sustained growth and increased profitability. We have room to grow and the ability to grow in many different ways. We are growing by opening more stores, by increasing the productivity of all stores and by developing new formats, new markets and new channels of growth vehicles.","During the first quarter this year, we opened 94 new stores and we relocated and expanded 28 existing stores for a total of 122 projects. Total square footage increased 6.8%. We ended the quarter with 5080 stores and we are on track with our plan for the full year, which includes 375 new stores and 75 relocations and expansions for a total of 450 projects across the U.S. and Canada. As a reminder, square footage for the full year is planned to increase 7% over fiscal 2013.","In addition to opening more stores, we continued to develop our strategy to increase productivity in all stores. Some of our sales initiatives include category expansions; our customers are finding more value as we continue to rationalize and expand assortments in candy, stationery, health, beauty and eyewear as well as home and household products. Across the chain, customers are seeing more powerful seasonal and party presentations that create excitement and a fun shopping experience.","We plan for our storefronts to change like the leaves on the trees, creating seasonal energy in our stores. In the minds of our customers we want to own the seasons at the $1 price point.","Store associates are emphasizing more effective customer engagement throughout the store and at the front end to drive sales of related items through cross merchandising and suggested selling.","Our goal is to provide value and a shopping experience that exceeds the expectations of every customer and every store, every day. We are doubling down on being first of the month ready with an increased emphasis on chunky displays of basic consumable core items. We are reintroducing our See What $20 Buys, along with our Stretch Your Dollar campaign through in store promotions and digital media. And to satisfy basis needs and to drive increased shopping frequency, we continue to expand our frozen and refrigerated category.","In the first quarter, we installed freezers and coolers in 112 additional stores. We now offer frozen and refrigerated products in 3,269 stores and we\u2019re on track with our plan to have freezers and coolers to 320 additional stores and to expand the frozen and refrigerated sections in 50 stores this year. This category continues to serve the needs of our customers and it\u2019s a reason to come into the store more often. This increase in shopping frequency provides the opportunity to increase sales across all categories including our higher margin discretionary products.","Another key component of our growth strategy is the expansion of Deal$, Dollar Tree Canada, and Dollar Tree Direct. Our Deal$ format extends our ability to serve more customers with more categories and increases our unit growth potential. Deal$ stores deliver low prices on everyday essentials, party goods, seasonal and home product. By lifting the restriction of the $1 price point at Deal$, we're able to serve more customers with more products at value prices every day.","We ended the quarter with a total of 217 Deal$ stores and growing. Our Canadian integration and expansion continues. We opened 11 new stores in the first quarter under Dollar Tree Canada brand and ended the quarter with 189 Canadian stores well on our way to achieving our growth plan for the year.","Leveraging the buying power of Dollar Tree, our merchants are sourcing higher value product and our Canadian customers are finding broader, more exciting assortments and better values in the stores. We see enormous potential in Canada. As we grow and improve, we believe the Canadian market can support up to 1,000 Dollar Tree stores. This is in addition to the 7,000 store potential for Dollar Tree in the United States, plus additional growth in our Deal$ format. Our goal is to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of $1.25 just as we are in the U.S. at $1 price point.","Adding to our gross strategy, Dollar Tree Direct, our e-commerce business is -- rapidly expanding. Dollar Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, drive incremental sales, expand the brand and attract more customers into our stores.","Our customer traffic continues to grow as we expand the breadth of assortment and points of contact with customers online. Dollar Tree Direct and Deal$ Direct, now have over 4000 items available online an increase of 50% versus the same time last year.","This increase in assortment is showing up in our customer visits. In the first quarter, our online traffic increased 19% over the first quarter last year. We\u2019ve expanded the functionality of our mobile platforms adding the ability for shoppers to post reviews of products and to share their Dollar Tree stories via their mobile devices. Over 2.2 million people visited the mobile version of our site in the first quarter, an increase of more than 34%. Dollar Tree Direct is gaining customers every quarter, and we expect to see sustainable growth in our Dollar Tree Direct sales. Check this out online, there is always something exciting going on at Dollar Tree.","As you know, we\u2019ve always planned to support our growth with investments in infrastructure and distribution capacity ahead of the need. We recently broke ground on a 250,000 square foot expansion of our distribution center in Joliet, Illinois. This project will bring the total size of the facility to 1,450,000 square feet, an increase of 21%. The project is scheduled for completion by year-end. We are also in early stages of work on our 11th distribution center; we will provide more details on this project as the plans are finalized.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kevin who will give you more detail on our financial metric and provide guidance.","Kevin S. Wampler","Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our diluted earnings per share increased 13.6% in the first quarter to $0.67 per share. This reflects our sales growth, expense control and the impact of share deliveries in the first quarter as part of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program.","Starting with gross profit, our gross profit margin was 34.8% during the first quarter compared with 35.2% in the first last year, a change of about 35 basis points. The decrease resulted from higher freight and distribution expenses. Freight expense increased by 30 basis points, reflecting higher trucking rates, driver shortages and weather related disruptions on inbound trucking, impacting deliveries to our DCs and reducing opportunities for backhauls. Excluding the freight impact, merchandised margin was slightly higher than the first quarter of last year.","Distribution expenses increased 25 basis points, primarily driven by the expense associated with our new DC in Windsor, Connecticut. This facility opened in June of last year. We should annualize the year-on-year expense impact of this additional facility in the second half. These two items were partially offset by reduced shrink expense, leverage on occupancy cost and continued improvements in initial mark-up.","SG&A expenses were 23.2% of sales for the quarter, compared with 23.6% in the first quarter of last year. Payroll related expenses declined by approximately 50 basis points reflecting lower expenses for incentive compensation, medical benefits, retirement plan contributions, and workers\u2019 compensation.","We also had lower expenses for legal fees as well as leverage associated with the comparable store sales increase. These reductions were partially offset by increased utilities cost related to the colder weather which affected both usage and rate.","Operating income increased $15.4 million compared to the first quarter last year and operating margin remained at 11.6% compared with the 11.6% operating margin in the first quarter last year.","The tax rate for the quarter was 38.2%, this compares with a 38.1% tax rate in the first quarter last year. Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled $387.1 million compared with $383.3 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter 2013.","As you may recall, in September of 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program. Under this new authorization, the company invested $1 billion for share repurchases through an accelerated share repurchase program that was launched on September 17.","ASR was funded by $250 million of available cash and $750 million from the private placement of senior notes completed in September. We received 1.9 million shares as part of the ASR in the first quarter.","Subsequent till the end of the first quarter on May 15th of 2014, the company received an additional 1.2 million shares completing the ASR. All together the company received a total 18.1 million share out of the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program. The company has $1 billion remaining on it share repurchase authorization.","The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter was 207.7 million. Our consolidated inventory at quarter end was 3.3% greater than at the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 6.8%.","Consolidated inventory per selling square foot at cost decreased 3.3%. Our inventory turns increased in the first quarter and we expect continued improvement in the inventory turns for the full year.","We entered 2014 with leaner store level inventory than last year, reflecting our inventory management plan. We believe that current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings and our sales initiatives for the second quarter.","Capital expenditures were $71.9 million in the first quarter of 2014 versus $103.2 million in the first quarter last year, reflecting our investments to expand distribution capacity. For the full year of 2014, we are planning consolidated capital expenditures to be in the range of $350 to $360 million.","Capital expenditures are focused on new stores and remodels, including additional fee development stores, the addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to approximately 320 stores, IT system enhancements, expansion of our Joliet, Illinois distribution center and the beginning phases of work on our 11th distribution center.","Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter totaled $50.8 million versus $45.1 million in the first quarter last year, an increase of approximately 10 basis points. We expect depreciation expense to be in the range of $200 to $210 million for the year.","Our guidance for 2014 takes into accounts the actual performance in the first quarter and except for small refinement to the share count and tax rate is unchanged from that which we issued on February 26.","It includes the following assumptions. First, we were pleased with the results of our May 1st ocean freight negotiations, which were consistent with the assumptions in our previous guidance.","As always, we cannot predict the direction of diesel prices for the next year. For this reason, our guidance assumes that diesel prices will be similar to their current levels on average throughout fiscal 2014.","We also cannot predict future currency fluctuations. We have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. And as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, this year there is one additional selling day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which returns us to a more normal pattern than last year.","Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 38.4% for the second quarter and 38.3% for the full year. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 206.7 million shares for the second quarter and 206.9 million shares for the full year.","While we still see share repurchase as a good use of cash, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchase. With this in mind, for the second quarter of 2014, we are forecasting sales in the range of $1.97 billion to $2.02 billion, based on a low single-digit comparable store sale increase and 7.2% square footage growth.","Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.64, which represents a 3.6% to 14.3% increase compared to the second quarter 2013 earnings of $0.56 per diluted share.","For the full fiscal year of 2014, we are forecasting sales in the range of $8.37 billion to $8.54 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in comparable store sales and 7% square footage growth.","Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $2.94 to $3.12. This represents an increase of 8.1% to 14.7% over 2013 earnings per share of $2.72.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Kevin. In summary, during the first quarter 2014, comp store sales grew 2%. Customers are visiting our stores more often and we\u2019re attracting new customer\u2019s everyday, both traffic and average sale were positive with results being driven primarily by increased customer traffic.","Our sales strength throughout the quarter with the highest comp sales in April, sales momentum has continued into May. Total sales grew 7.2% into a first quarter record $2 billion. We achieved 11.6% operating margin tying our first quarter records at last year and earnings per share increased 13.6% to $0.67.","We opened 94 new stores in 2013, expanded and relocated 28 stores and ended the quarter with 5,080 stores and square footage growth of 6.8%. We expanded frozen and refrigerated product to 112 additional stores for a total of 3,269 stores across the U.S.","Our inventory is balanced and increasingly productive. Our turns increased in the first quarter and we entered the second quarter well prepared for new store growth and customer demand. And we continue to manage our capital for the benefit of long-term shareholders.","We invested more than $1 billion for share repurchase over the past four quarters and have another 1 billion authorization remaining. Now in our 28th year, Dollar Tree has built an exemplary record of consistent profitable growth.","This performance has been the result of the collaborative efforts of tens of thousands of Dollar Tree associates working together to deliver value to every customer at every store, every day. As I look into the future, I see even more exciting opportunity.","Our balance sheet is strong. The Dollar Tree business model is powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of earnings. It has been tested by time and validated by history.","We have multiple platforms for growth. The Dollar Tree brand is a benchmark of value for our customers and there is great opportunity to grow and expand the Dollar Tree brand in the U.S. through more stores and more productive stores.","The Deal$ brand is serving customers with increased value on even more categories. Dollar Tree direct continues to broaden its reach to customer throughout North America and we\u2019re working to build, expand and improve the Dollar Tree Canada brand.","We remained committed to a concept that customers love, and we\u2019re positioned to continue grow in profitably for many years ahead. We have a vision of where we want to go and the ability to execute with the infrastructure, capital and most importantly, our talented management team who has a long history on retail success.","It\u2019s a great time to be Dollar Tree, as we enter the second quarter, our inventories are clean and fresh, the shelves are full of terrific merchandise, our stock rooms are in great shape and our values have never been higher.","We will now address your questions, so that we can accommodate as many call as time permits. We ask that you limit your questions to two.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll go to our first question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. How are you?","Kevin Wampler","Great, Scot. Good morning.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Excellent, little bit more -- I was just wondering if you can give us little bit more Bob on the cadence of the quarter. First of all, how large was the volatility, kind of when you looked through the quarter? And then, number two, any idea kind of how to size the, any kind of weather impact and your general thoughts on how much weather may have impacted the sales trends? Thanks.","Bob Sasser","Yes, Scot. Well, basically as I said earlier, the sales strengthened throughout the quarter. April was the strongest. There was a shift of Easter as you know which helped April, as well as the weather continued to improve a little bit as we got into April. The quarter was terrifically impacted by named storms. Just as a little reminder, you know we had 26 named storms across the season last year, 11 of those were in first quarter and as we moved into February there were 6 in February, there were 4 in March, almost one a week and then one in April the very first week of April. So as we moved through the quarter, as weather improved and as we got closer to the Easter holiday, our sales strengthened and that momentum has continued into May.","Both consumables and our discretionary categories grew, both were comp positive with the discretionary business only slightly growing at a faster rate. In terms of geography as you might guess, the southern zones did better; our sales were led in the Southwest followed by the Southeast and then the Midwest and of course the Northeast which was the most impacted by the negative weather was lagged alone. Top performing categories, we already talked about. We had candy and check-out and our trend. Our stationery business was very strong. Valentine and Easter seasonal, Valentine even with the horrible weather, the week of Valentine\u2019s Day we had an acceptable Valentine\u2019s Day season. So we are pleased to have come out of that as we did. And of course we continue to grow our frozen and refrigerated as well as our snacks and beverages.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Bob, was the Northeast negative in the quarter?","Bob Sasser","You know I think we don\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to break it out but I would characterize it as \u2013 it was the lagging, I guess.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Bur that - specifically the Northeast recovered as we got through kind of April and into May?","Bob Sasser","Absolutely. It was weather; the Northeast as you know was the most impacted by weather. Valentine\u2019s day I \u2013 we had storms, we had all the bad stuff that went on there. So I\u2019m not trying to give you a weather report, just trying to share with you the cadence of the sales. Our sales strengthened because of weather improving and because of getting closer to Easter as you went through the quarter our sales strengthened. February into March and then into April with April being the strongest.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Understood, thank you.","Bob Sasser","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Hey, guys on the gross margin front, can you speak to underlying drivers of the core merchandise margin being positive here, opportunities going forward and what you are seeing on the sourcing front today?","Bob Sasser","You know as I\u2019ve always said, we are in control of our merchandise margin and we are merchants and have managed that just terrifically over the years. Our basic purchase mark up I guess on our margin was solid and slightly better. The shrink also improved as a component of our gross margins. The sort of the drag was the transportation cost component of our gross margin. Kevin.","Kevin S. Wampler","Yeah, well I think just to give maybe a little color on the transportation cost. If you look at you know the weather definitely impacted us, definitely you know where we saw the biggest impact was in the Port of New York, which got backed up significantly, big disruption there you know first weather did backed it up and then there was a lack of equipment because truck chassis were not being returned and put back into use within the business. So that was a big problem and as well as a fact that in Vancouver we had some disruption from the truckers strike for a period of about a week to two weeks roughly.","So those are definitely things that were not expected. To move freight we had to pay some higher rates, and make sure we could keep things moving so there are some one time costs there. I would tell you in general though as we go forward you know we are seeing and it\u2019s still within our guidance is the idea of the fact that there are some pressures on freight cost within our business. There is a somewhat shortage of truckers out there in some regards you know they changed the rules of operations for truckers last summer, so the amount of hours they can spend on the road and so forth and it does have a direct impact on the industry at the end of the day. So but that is built into our model and into our guidance, but we could see some continued pressure there as we go forward.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Great. And then one quick follow up. On capital allocation you guys have talked to comfort operating with more leverage on the books, the ASR is now complete; can you just talk about priorities on the capital front?","Kevin S. Wampler","Sure, I mean, I think as you\u2019ve heard me say before as we look at it obviously you know the best use of a dollar is build another Dollar Tree store. We have plans to open 375 new stores this year and 75 relocations, so 450 projects there, so that\u2019s always our first and foremost. Again we continue to work on our infrastructure from the stand point of you know we are expanding DC3 for us which is in Joliet. We are looking at DC 11 you know trying to put that on a board and plan out accordingly. So those are going to be uses of capital as we continue to go forward.","After that, you know as we\u2019ve always talked about this acquisitions which historically you know the last one we did was Canada - nothing going on there and then you get into dividends and the Board of Directors basically has looked at that in the past and we\u2019ve talked about that and we really feel like we are going to put our money towards growing the company, and then returning to shareholders through our share repurchase program which is where we\u2019ve been a -- good way for us to return value to our shareholders at the end of the day. So, I don\u2019t think our overall thought processes have changed in any regards in that way. And again, the ASR has been complete and we\u2019ll go from there.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Great. Best of luck.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Joan Storm with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Joan Storm - Wedbush Securities","Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter.","Bob Sasser","Thanks, Joan.","Joan Storm - Wedbush Securities","So I had a question on your merchandising and your - the non - the discretionary categories jumped up pretty well. And I know for competitive reasons you don\u2019t want to disclose a lot about that, but can you hint anything about whether [inaudible] there going forward and also on the club scene, tell us what you think about the consumer [inaudible] and you know the multiples been [inaudible] little bit for a low single digit comp versus a mid single digit comp and what does it take to get sort of back to that?","Bob Sasser","Okay, Joan I\u2019ll give it a shot here. You know we always talk about our merchandise assortment. It\u2019s a balanced mix of things people need and things people want. So basically the things you need everyday is faster turning merchandise, creates traffic in our stores, it\u2019s a reason to shop Dollar Tree; you go there for all the great values on paper goods and HBC and household supplies and all the things that you need to consume on a frequent basis and that adds shopping trips to our stores, it also serves our customer needs very well.","Alongside that, we\u2019ve always strived to sell a balanced mix which is also the discretionary merchandise. We are very proud of our party business, with our seasonal businesses. We had talked about it as changing like the leaves on the trees and what that means is, the fronts of our stores are always changing. We place great, we place a lot of importance to our shopping experience at Dollar Tree. People - customers shop Dollar Tree because we have great values on things they need, and it\u2019s a fun experience they always find something that they didn\u2019t expect, they find things for the party, they find things for the season, they find toys for the kids and as we say everybody leaves happy because at Dollar Tree you can still afford to splurge even in tough times and buy those things for your kids.","So we always plan to sell and we manage our business appropriately mixing out that balance between products needed and products that are discretionary. It\u2019s about a 49 to 51 discretionary to needs and sometimes it goes 50:50 and it\u2019s plus or minus in that range and that\u2019s the way we plan our business; it\u2019s not by accident, it\u2019s by plan and it\u2019s one of the reasons that our operating margin is the highest in our sector and always has been. We strive to exceed the expectations of our customer not only with the values that they need but also the shopping experience we come to Dollar Tree because I enjoy shopping Dollar Tree. I really like to go to Dollar Tree. I take my kids and I can buy them things that I couldn\u2019t buy in other places. And you hear those kinds of experiences from our customers.","As to the customer, I think the customer is still burdened and worried and it\u2019s just been, you know it seems like there are some signs of improvement out there but the pressure remains and it\u2019s just been a long stubborn period of high unemployment and high cost and anxiety over uncertainty, so it\u2019s been a real strain on family budgets. Our job at Dollar Tree as always is to be part of the solution. So once again we try to offer the things our customers need as they need more of the consumable products, we\u2019ve increased that in our mix in our stores, again striving for that balance. And then to exceed their expectation for what they can buy on each visit, every customer every store every day.","Joan Storm - Wedbush Securities","Right. Thanks, a lot Bob.","Bob Sasser","You\u2019re welcome Joan.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, Great quarter guys.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","","Wanted to just ask about our new store productivity, it was little bit lighter than we had modeled and kind of your historical average but you also opened up few more stores than we modeled for 1Q. So just wanted to ask about maybe the timing of the openings, if that had any impact, and just what you think about new store productivity moving forward?","Bob Sasser","Well you know I\u2019m not concerned about it. It\u2019s a little lower than you might expect it. We have changed our cadence a little bit. The weather had an impact on that. We opened up in the first quarter, fewer of our urban stores which are typically the higher margin higher margin per square foot stores. We\u2019ve still got those coming, but we didn\u2019t open any in the first quarter. The weather had an impact delayed some of our openings in the first quarter and as well as impacting customer traffic. So having said that, I mean, it\u2019s all annualized number. So we\u2019ve got very few weeks and days in some cases to use in our annualization but it\u2019s not concerning, we still believe in the concept that in our customers when they can get out they are shopping in our stores and I believe we are going to see the productivity rise as we go through the year.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","","That\u2019s helpful. And just Bob, you know we\u2019ve had pretty mixed results across a lot of retailers year-to-date. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the health of the consumer today, obviously Dollar Tree is positioned well regardless of you know where we are heading from an economic standpoint, but what are you sensing as you hear from customers and walk stores, you know do you believe that the environment is improving a bit or is this still a very challenging market place for your color consumer?","Bob Sasser","You know I believe it\u2019s still challenging Paul. The lowest demographic in term of demographic consumers have to specially the low, middle and the lowest have specially been pressured with less in their food stance and less in their entire movements. And then the talks about you know the still the unemployment issues, it remains high, there is always concern about you know how long the benefits are going to last until I get a job, so it\u2019s a worried and concerned consumer. I believe that we are well positioned as you can be.","Again, we strive to offer that balanced mix, everything is a Dollar, a Dollar Tree, so in terms of Dollar Tree you can buy the things you need everyday and from a little bit of money. So that\u2019s I think that has change. It feels to me like things are improving, but it doesn\u2019t feel like consumer has actually brought in. And then, I mean every buy into that and I think we have gone through a time where people have been forever touched by some way. It is through higher unemployment or just the ability to run their families or run their businesses and all that goes with the down economy I think have been forever changed in their habits. We continue to see new customers, our traffic continues to grow, some of it is more frequent shopping by existing customers, some of it are still those people that come in and say how much is that switch, you know it\u2019s a clue that they haven\u2019t\u2019 been there before, because obviously the answer is a Dollar.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","","Thank you.","Bob Sasser","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Charles Grom with Stern Agee. Please go ahead.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Hey good morning, Bob, good morning Kevin. Great quarter here. So Bob when you take a look back at the improvement in your sales this quarter over the past six, seven years it\u2019s pretty impressive. I think we\u2019d all agree on that. But since the third quarter of 2012, comps have been in the 2% range, traffic is positive, but certainly not what you were doing five, six years ago. And I guess, my question is, when you at over the next five to ten years and you look at the opportunities within the four walls of the store to improve productivity, where do you think it can go? And I guess, what\u2019s the pace of that and I guess how do you get there?","Bob Sasser","Those are five and ten-year questions, but they are really tough to answer. I can tell you what we\u2019re doing. I can tell you how we think about growing our business and I can tell you how we\u2019re going to continue to improve our sales square foot. We\u2019re always about running better stores.","We always focused in our stores with initiatives that speak to increasing average ticket, increasing customer engagement, being the friendly, fun place to shop, we\u2019re always -- again we continue to expand assortment in our store based on customer needs. And you can see it on our sales that we\u2019ve gone through with the areas that we\u2019ve expanded the assortments, expanded SKUs, you can see, are coming up at the top end of our sale.","So, you can\u2019t have -- there are ebbs and flows to any business. Stacking comps on top of comps, on top of comps, but I think we -- if you look at three-year stacks, you\u2019ll feel lot better about it. And I believe that comps can continue to improve. But they are all obviously going to have to be review of the overview of the last three years, the last five years and what the next year\u2019s comp to that.","So, we\u2019re going to keep drive our business, our customers love what we are doing. We\u2019re in a market that value is of the utmost importance and we\u2019re clearly, people that have the value that we\u2019ve built the business based on value. Everything the dollar you just can\u2019t beat that for value. As we\u2019ve gone through time we continue to expand what you can buy per dollar and we\u2019ll continue to that adding even more value as we go forward.","So over the next five years, we\u2019re going to continue to grow. We\u2019ve got a lot of more new Dollar Trees that we can open in the U.S. We have our Deal$ stores that we\u2019re using largely in our urban high density markets, because we think that by lifting the restriction of the price point, we can have even higher sales productivity and serve those customers and those urban markets better. We have Dollar Tree Canada which is coming along. We are expanding that business. We have [opened] I think 189 stores somewhere around there from the 86 that we bought.","So, we continue to grow Canada. There was just a terrific amount of space that we can build new stores whether it would be geography or Deal$ new type store or our Dollar Tree Direct business alongside of our Dollar Tree business. So, more stores continue to focus on sales per square foot, better stores and over the next five years, in our growth trajectory is still going to be amongst the highest in retail I believe.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay. And just one follow-up on your comments there and also the kind of follow-up on Matt\u2019s question earlier about capital allocation. I just want to attack it from a little bit different angle. In that -- of these three major Dollar stores, you guys historically been the most acquisitive. You did Deal$ several years ago. You went into Canada a couple years ago. Is there anything on the horizon that you guys are looking at to plug into to enhance that growth in addition to other success you guys have had with the Deal$ stores? You have lot of cash in the balance sheet. You\u2019re arguably a little bit underlevered. Is there anything you would look to do accelerate that growth?","Bob Sasser","We\u2019re always looking for good companies and we\u2019re looking for opportunities to enter new businesses. I don\u2019t see anything right now, but we are very focused on. Our last acquisition was in Canada and we really expect standing that up and getting that going in the right direction. And we\u2019ve got a lot of energy focus towards that as well as our Deal$ business. So -- but we\u2019re always looking. We\u2019re always open to good opportunities.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, great. Best of luck and thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Anthony Chukumba - BB&T Capital Market","Good morning, and congrats on the strong quarter.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Anthony Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets","So I just had a question about sourcing. Just wondering if there\u2019s anything that you\u2019re seeing different from a positive perspective, negative perspective particularly given the slowdown in the Chinese economy? Thanks.","Bob Sasser","We\u2019ll just keep driving our business and about 40% of our product comes from somewhere rather than the U.S. mostly from China. I did not make the last trip, but the results of it, the April trip would continue to be strong. We hit our margin targets again. The market really is open to our kind of business and as much as we go and we actually place orders and lay down orders, and we stand by our commitments, we\u2019ve spent years building relationship with our Chinese as well as all of our vendors that continue to grow.","As we\u2019ve gotten larger and placing margin orders, we\u2019ve involved more factories and developed more relationship. So, that is, I would characterize our foreign sourcing as being really unchanged and really strategic advantage that we have over many, especially since we aspire to continue to thrill our customers with types of product that are -- if can find offshore, the things like our toy business and our party business and our seasonal business and all of our stationary business. There\u2019s a lot of that product that comes from somewhere else.","Domestically, we continue to drive those businesses too. We are very proud of our relationships at home. Obviously more of our business comes from the U.S. than come from anywhere else, 60%. So continue to drive those businesses. We enjoy a terrific relationship with many of those large consumer product companies across the country. And I believe that we\u2019ll continue to grow and the consumer continues to seek value that part of our business will continue to improve and excel.","Anthony Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James & Associates","Thanks. Good morning, Bob.","Bob Sasser","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James & Associates","I wanted to ask you, when you benchmark your performance in Canada against Dollarama, what would be the puts and takes -- I know you won\u2019t give any specifics comps or margins, but how much of a differential in kind of qualitative terms you\u2019d willing to go?","Bob Sasser","Right As we benchmark against Dollarama -- that is a terrific company by the way. And we\u2019re the new guy on the block, so to speak. We are the largest in the U.S. than what we do. But as we go into Canada, we are very humble and we realized that we aren\u2019t the largest there.","So the first thing is, they have the size. They are the large company that\u2019s been there a long time. So, the growth, I think is important for us in Canada -- more stores, the brand, building the brand in Canada, many Canadians know Dollar Tree of the U.S. But that\u2019s just not good enough. I mean, you have to be in Canada, you have to be their store of choice. So we\u2019re building the brand in Canada. We\u2019re growing. We\u2019re building size in Canada. And all the while we are building store teams there and people and the ability to run the Canadian business. There are desires in Canada. There are consumer needs. We\u2019re paying very close attention to that. And there are things that we don\u2019t know still that we\u2019re very -- again, we\u2019re very humble and we\u2019re willing and eager to continue to evolve to sort of that Canadian customer. It\u2019s not a Dollar Tree from the U.S. and Canada, it\u2019s a Dollar Tree Canada, and so building that assortment.","But, as we benchmark there, we are the smallest guy. We are growing. We have a big idea. And again we\u2019re the only single -- the largest single price point operator in Canada, and that\u2019s the message that we\u2019re trying to get to our consumers.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James & Associates","And Kevin, when you look at your expenses per square foot, that actually decline now -- decline two consecutive years and it\u2019s typically, I think you talk about needing one or two comp to maintain a flat expense rate. But you\u2019re also doing lot better than that, but it\u2019s not -- it doesn\u2019t appear to be sustainable in the long run, but I want to get your thought on the sustainability of the 1%, 2% drop in expenses per foot?","Kevin Wampler","Sure. I mean, as I\u2019ve said before, I know that it\u2019s a metric that many of you folks use out there. We tend not to use that so much. We always look at, as I\u2019ve said, line item by line item. And I think, part of it, as we\u2019ve continue to grow over the last four, five years part of it is scale. Part of it is technology. Part of it is initiatives surrounding certain expenses and how can we do it better.","And again, when everything is a dollar, the penny is count and everybody realizes that\u2019s part of our culture, it\u2019s built in from day one. Everybody realizing that the expense side of the ledger has to be a strict focus as well, so, again I think as we have said it, one, two comp typically would help us -- get us flat on our SG&A.","But we\u2019re always working to try to leverage things. We got some benefit in Q1 from our medical benefits. Last year, we had huge claims. We had more large claims than ever. It was a really unusual year. Those things tend to be cyclical, tough for some reason and maybe this year is going to be a better year. You can\u2019t always say, but that\u2019s something I can\u2019t rely on at the end of the day.","But as we look at things, we always believe there\u2019s room for improvement. We always talk about continues improvement, continues ways to improve our business as well as the processes around, I mean, that\u2019s really the way we go about a day in and day out. And as I\u2019ve said, more on a line item basis or a detailed line item basis as opposed to looking at it a per square foot basis.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James & Associates","But you had called out incentive comp, given that the second quarter same-store sales are starting stronger than that low single-digit guidance. If that were to continue, would it be probable that your incentive comp would increase year-over-year in the second quarter?","Bob Sasser","Well, first I would say, your first statement relating to business going forward being stronger than our low single-digit comp. I don\u2019t know that I would agree with that. So let\u2019s start there at the end of the day, let make sure we have that right. We were just saying that...","Dan Wewer - Raymond James & Associates","Bob, what you said it was -- April was better than 2%. And then May momentum was good?","Bob Sasser","We said basically that strongest period was April, but obviously part of that, the fact that Easter shifted later in the April. But I think, we\u2019re talking about in general is as it relates to our guidance that we\u2019ve given. So let\u2019s start there. And then I think as we think things like incentive comp, it depends upon -- we have higher expectations that we will improve our business. And part of that is at store level and another big part of is in the store support center.","So, as we\u2019re look at those things, this business improves, yes, those expenses may go up, but the hope would be, because we\u2019re beating sales guidance, and you actually leverage them in the long run. So I think it\u2019s kind of two components there that go into it over time, which is kind of way I would look at it.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for a couple of more questions. We\u2019ll go to our next question from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company","Hi. It\u2019s Dan Binder.","Bob Sasser","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company","Hi, it's Dan Binder. Usually it's Dan Binder; today it's Dan Sinder - So I had a couple of questions. First, on a point of clarification around the whole Easter shift in April business. When we adjusted the Easter shift, did you still see sequential improvement April versus March? And then my second question was around the pricing environment. You heard from target that they\u2019re getting more promotional. They already have, Walmart has been pretty competitive since last fall, just curious your thoughts on the pricing environment if you need to react at all?","Kevin Wampler","Dan, since I\u2019m the one that said, what I said about the sales building throughout the quarter. Let me say again, sales strengthen throughout the quarter -- first quarter and momentum continued in to May. All that\u2019s in our guidance. We\u2019re not given you new guidance with that comment. We did consider all that in the guidance that we gave for the second quarter.","As far as the competition you know, we see all that. I think our values are up too. Our prices still a dollar, but the way we, as you know Dan, in our business is, we offer the most value that we can at the dollar at the margins we\u2019re willing to accept overall. And I think you can shop at our stores right now, you\u2019d find some terrific values for a dollar, it\u2019s still a dollar, but we add more to the product from time to time. We have our wow items out there, more wow items than ever.","I believe that we\u2019re very, very competitive and having said that, we\u2019re just different than the other guys anyway. Our price is a dollar yesterday will be a dollar tomorrow, the dollar today, it\u2019s all about offering the most value for that dollar. And as long as we can do that, than we\u2019ll be successful. We feel pretty good about our position.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company","One of the things that I\u2019ve noticed in retail over the last several months and just generally speaking, is as retailers have experienced software sales you can see it in sort of the way they are staffing the stores as labors come out, and then you get these inflection points, where weather improves and they think they get unprepared for the volume and you know it\u2019s in terms of the longer line or out of stocks or whatever, I mean just curious if you could give us a little color on how you\u2019ve been managing labor in your stores?","Bob Sasser","Well it\u2019s pretty much the way we\u2019ve managed it for years. We looked at it on a productivity basis, and of course we are always looking to deploy techniques and labor plans and support our stores in a way that allows us to leverage and improve the productivity of our labor and our stores. We measure it, report on it our stores and if our goal that \u2013 trying to meet as we do more sales you know you get more labor but we are trying to leverage that and that\u2019s pretty much the way we\u2019ve done it for the past 10 to 15 years.","And I don\u2019t think you will see any longer lines and that\u2019s of course that you have seen or will see. And frankly right now, I believe our stores and it gives position both from a merchandised standpoint, from stock rooms in the best shape, it\u2019s been on a long time. Our store teams have really done a terrific job of running and they are improving the standards in our stores, while at the same time being more productive at driving sales in the store that can support the labor.","So, we are going to continue to do that. Our stores know how to do that, I\u2019m real proud of whenever they come up with a better labor number, because I know it just didn\u2019t happen because of plan, it\u2019s because initiative, it\u2019s because of focus and actually they are doing the right thing.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question today from Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners","Okay. Great. Thanks, good morning everyone. I had a question on the impulse initiative. And just -- you called it out as -- check-out as the stronger area of the store during the quarter. So I'm just wondering how much of that ties into what you're doing with impulse merchandise, and how that initiative is evolving? I know you had talked about doing more suggestive selling at the register, if you're still doing that. And if you look at that initiative, how would you rank it in order of the various comp drivers for the year, including, let's say, the cooler program?","Bob Sasser","You know it\u2019s one of the more powerful initiatives that we have I think for a couple of reasons. It\u2019s the first thing \u2013 when you walk in the store, the front of the store the first thing you see and it\u2019s the last thing you see. So if you remember a year so ago, we were talking about playing up our front end, and lowering the profile so you could see the cashiers, cashiers could see the customers, lowering the profile remerchandising that whole front end.","And we re-merchandised our check land first of all with things that you need on the way out, you might not have thought about it, but why not buy a pack of gum or something that you need a pocket comb -- hundreds of items up there, but that\u2019s the idea is to offer more and last chance to buy something on that check-out trip. And in that front aisle there, you\u2019ll find new products, you\u2019ll seasonal products and you\u2019ll find we got trend merchandise and we\u2019re always looking for something that\u2019s new, unique, it might be seasonally relevant, it might be trend relevant, you\u2019ll find fun, exciting things on the front-end designed to come in be brought and go away. It adds to our sales and it also adds to the customer experience in the store.","So those are two big initiatives that we have been working with and we\u2019ll continue to drive our comp sales forward as we go forward. And the last thing you ask about is what we call our drive items. And that is our cash here is we have an item with -- drive item each week and our cash here across the country as you check out or engaging you, hopefully smiling at you as have you seen our new whatever pen or whatever hand sanitizer or this just came in and or would you like to buy another candy bar? Or things like that.","So our cashiers are doing a couple of things; one, when you know that our customers like being engaged personally at the front end. So it accomplishes that and it\u2019s just that one last chance to get another item than to shopping bag -- as they go through it. So through [cost] -- by the way they offer till you buy it, it helps us and of course the fact that\u2019s really important, would appreciate some help with that.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners","And for the impact on -- you know it\u2019s obviously more of an impact on average tickets than traffic, right. Did you talk about the average ticket during the quarter; you said it was up a little bit, right?","Bob Sasser","It was up slightly. Most of our increase was due to traffic. So you got some puts and takes there, so improving your front end, you are improving the impulse sales. At the same time, there are pressures on consumers from time to time or that it may be flying less more frequently I think that\u2019s happening. We saw some things with bracelets and food stamps, not a big number for us but our traffic on food stamps was about unchanged but the average selling food stamps is a little less.","I think that\u2019s tied directly to the fact that they are getting less food stamps, now that program has been cut back. So we always have some puts and takes, Patrick, you know some things were always driving our sales and for instance in this case, right up there towards comparable comp with our front end, our check outs and our trend merchandise reflect they are all of \u2013 there are all of ways puts and takes in this business that\u2019s in task. Every plus is not a 100% plus, sometimes it\u2019s one plus one equals 1.5, so that\u2019s my answer for that.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners","Okay. Thank you, Bob.","Bob Sasser","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.","Timothy J.

The Dollar Tree segment delivered its 45th consecutive positive comp quarter with a 2.5 comp and Family Dollar same store sales delivered a positive 1.9% despite the shift of early Snap sales into Q4 from February. ","GAAP earnings per share were $1.12, on an adjusted basis, excluding the accelerated rent expense for Family Dollar stores scheduled to close in 2019. Related to ASC 842, diluted EPS was $1.14 within a penny of the high end of our guidance range. ","Other key highlights for the quarter included completing 372 Family Dollar H2 model renovations, completing 324 Dollar Tree snack zones, reinitiating our share buyback program, purchasing $100 million worth of shares in the quarter and continuing to remain on track with our consolidation of store support centers. As many of our Family Dollar associates and new hires are now in the process of moving to the Chesapeake campus. ","As we outlined in the previous call, due to the cost associated with our store optimization initiatives and store support center consolidation project, year-over-year operating income is expected to be lower in the first half of fiscal 2019, but is expected to show improvement in the second half as the initiatives gain traction. The majority of our previously announced store closings are taking place in the second quarter along with the completion of our store support center consolidation. ","For Dollar Tree, sales highlights in the first quarter, Dollar Tree saw nice increases in both traffic and ticket, with traffic slightly outpacing the ticket increase. Geographically all regions comped positively. Cadence of comps through the quarter, April was the stronger comp month of the quarter and March was negative. Both months were impacted by the timing shift of the Easter holiday.","Dollar Tree continues to deliver solid positive comps in the consumables category, and our seasonal business performed very well. We remain strong and our Dollar Tree's Easter season was one of our best sell-throughs ever. ","At Dollar Tree Canada the team delivered mid-single digit positive comps for the quarter, with increases in both ticket and traffic. The consumable comp outperformed discretionary, top performing categories include Easter seasonal food and household products. ","Highlights in Q1 for Dollar Tree Direct are online business. We saw increases on our in-line comp sales, items available for sale, site visitors and engagement. Our ecommerce team continues to do a great job of engaging with our customers through a number of avenues. Our online content is constantly evolving to reflect our changing assortment, and we are very active in promoting the Dollar Tree brand through blog post, banner ads and social media. The team also did a great job in producing and distributing our catalogs for the Easter holiday and the upcoming summer season. ","Looking at real-estate for both banners in the first quarter, we opened a total of 91 new stores 65 Dollar Tree\u2019s and 26 Family Dollar stores; we relocated or expanded 11 stores 6 Dollar Tree and 5 Family Dollar; we renovated 372 Family Dollar stores as part of our H2 renovation initiative, and we re-bannered 45 former Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree, for a total of 519 projects during the quarter. ","We also added freezers and coolers into 102 Dollar Tree stores during the first quarter, now bringing our total Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 5,766. During the quarter we closed 25 stores 9 Dollar Tree and 16 Family Dollars, and we ended with 15,264 stores, 7,102 being Dollar Trees and 8,162 being Family Dollar. ","Before I turn the call over to Duncan to discuss the Family Dollar business, I\u2019d like to provide you an update on tariffs. Our merchandising teams have done a terrific job of mitigating the effects of 25% tariffs imposed under Section 301 for Chinese goods included on Lists 1, 2, and 3. ","We are uncertain as to whether or when tariffs will be applied to the List 4 products currently being considered by the United States Trade Representative. If tariffs on List 4 products are implemented, we expect that it will be impactful to our business, and especially to consumers in general. Until we have more clarity, our outlook excludes the impact of tariffs on List 4 products. However our outlook continues to include the impact of tariffs on List 1, 2 and 3 products.","Our teams are doing a nice job managing the controllables and running our business. We continue to believe we are well positioned with the initiatives for both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree banners to capture the significant opportunity ahead of us. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Duncan. ","Duncan Mac Naughton ","Thank you Gary and good morning everyone. While we are pleased with the Family Dollar team\u2019s same-store sales increase of 1.9% for the quarter, we recognize there is much more work to be done. As we make progress on improving the consistency of execution across our store base and accelerate our efforts to optimize the real estate portfolio, we see great opportunity to improve Family Dollar\u2019s productivity and performance in 2019 and beyond. We are very bullish on our progress to-date and believe this will help transform our customer experience. ","Regarding Family Dollar sales highlights for the first quarter, an increase in average ticket drove the same-store sales increase in the quarter partially offset by a decline in transaction account. Consumables perform very well, delivering its 10th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales and the discretionary business was slightly negative. ","Regarding the cadence of comps during the quarter, February was negative impacted by the shift of early Snap sales into Q4. March was slightly positive and April was the strongest month of the quarter benefiting from the later Easter and 2019. ","Seven of our eight lines of businesses, comped positive for the quarter. From a regional perspective, six of our seven zones comped positive with the strongest performance in the North East, the West and the South East zones. As evidenced by our improved sales performance, our acceleration of initiatives to optimize the Family Dollar real-estate portfolio is delivering results. We are seeing meaningful improvement and operational performance across the footprint of renovated Family Dollar stores resulting in increased traffic and low double-digit comp sales list. ","We are pleased with the results of our H2 renovation program, both with traffic and the diversity of our locations. Comps are being driven, two-thirds by traffic and one-third by average ticket. ","Customer feedback has included the following: Customers indicate they are shopping more often and spending more for the improved assortment, broader selection of $1 items, more frozen and refrigerated products and in cleaner store. Our survey feedback indicates H2 shoppers have a better overall shopping experience. ","More than half of the H2 stores that shoppers indicate they will come back and spend more. In May we closed 140 stores and we\u2019ll close another 150 by the end of July. We are making progress on our previously announced plans. ","Given the results we are seeing from our store optimization initiative, we're confident it will allow us to drive substantial improvement in the quality and performance of the Family Dollar portfolio and create long term value. ","We are also in the process of consolidating our store support center. This project will be completed over the next few months and provide us great opportunity as an organization. We will benefit from the stability it provides and from the enhanced communication, collaboration and teamwork to provide our store teams with greater support. ","I will now turn the call to Kevin to provide more detail on our first quarter performance and our updated outlook for 2019. ","Kevin Wampler ","Thanks Duncan and good morning. Total sales for the first quarter increased 4.6% to $5.81 billion comprised of $2.96 billion at Dollar Tree and $2.85 billion at Family Dollar. ","Enterprise same-store sales increased 2.2%.. On a segment basis, same-store sales for the Dollar Tree segment increased 2.5% or 2.4% when adjusted for Canadian currency and the Family Dollar comp increased 1.9%. ","Overall gross profit increased 1.6% to $1.73 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year\u2019s quarter. As a percentage of sales gross margin decreased to 29.7% compared to 30.6% in Q1 of 2018. ","Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was flat at 34.5% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment\u2019s gross margin performance for the quarter included, higher distribution depreciation and payroll costs, increase freight costs, primarily outbound freight, as well as a higher portion of sales than the lower margin consumable category. These increases were offset by improved shrink and improved initial merchandise markdown. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 24.8% during the first quarter compared with 26.7% in the comparable prior year period. ","The year-over-year decline is due to the following: Merchandise costs including freight increased approximately 90 basis points. Primarily due to increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise, higher domestic freight costs and inventory markdowns for stores being closed and re-bannered in Q1. ","Shrink increased approximately 50 basis points resulting from unfavorable fiscal inventory results in the current year and an increase in the accrual rate. Distribution costs increased approximately 35 basis points resulting primarily from higher merchandising, distribution payroll related costs.","Occupancy costs increased approximately 20 basis points resulting from the $6.7 million of accelerated amortization of the right of use assets for Family Dollar stores we plan to close during 2019. Excluding these costs, occupancy costs would have delevered slightly as a percent of sales.","Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter increased 40 basis points to 23.1% from 22.7% in the same quarter last year. For the first quarter the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales increased to 21.3% compared to 21.1% for the first quarter of 2018. ","The increase was due to the following: Payroll costs increased approximately 20 basis points, primarily due to an increase in store hourly payroll, to an increased average hourly rate, supported company initiatives and an increase in incentive compensation resulting from prior year adjustments due to lower performance and targets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in retirement plan expense. ","Operating and corporate expense increased approximately 5 basis points resulting from higher debit and credit fees, primarily due to increased card penetration. Store operating costs decreased approximately 5 basis points due to lower utility cost, specifically electricity, resulting primarily from the benefit of the LED lighting program in the stores. ","Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Family Dollar segment was 21.6% as a percentage of sales in the first quarter compared to 21.5% for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was due to the net of the following: Payroll expenses increased approximately 25 basis points, primarily due to an increased store hourly payroll \u2013 increased average hourly rate and supported the company's initiatives related to the cost for store revelations, re-banners and closures. ","Store operating costs increased approximately 10 basis points due primarily to high refrigeration repairs and maintenance costs in the current quarter; and depreciation and amortization expense decreased [ph] approximately 25 basis points as a result of certain assets becoming fully appreciated before amortized. ","Corporate and support expenses increased 20 basis points as a result of 7.6 million of store support center consolidation costs and higher legal fees. On a consolidated basis, operating income was $385.5 million compared with $437.6 million in the same period last year. And operating income margin was 6.6% compared to 7.9% in last year's first quarter. ","Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 20 basis points to 13.2% when compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. Operating income margin for the Family Dollar segment was 3.2% for the quarter. ","Non- operating expenses for the quarter totaled $41.6 million which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Affected tax rate for the quarter was 22.1% compared to 22.6% in the prior year's first quarter. ","For the first quarter on a GAAP basis the company had net income of $267.9 million or $1.12 per diluted share compared to net income of $160.5 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the prior year\u2019s quarter. This year's first quarter included $6.7 million or $0.2 per diluted share of accelerated rent expense related to the adoption of ASC 842 for lease accounting that was not included in our previous company outlook. ","Adjusted EPS was $1.14. The prior year\u2019s quarter included $0.52 of cost associated with debt refinancing. Today's press release includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures or details on these adjustments. ","Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $725.8 million compared to $422.1 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Our outstanding debt as of May 4, 2019 was approximately $4.3 billion. ","During the first quarter we invested $100 million in the repurchase of approximately 960,000 shares of stock. At quarter end we had $900 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We'll provide updates on additional share purchases if any following the quarter in which they may occur.","Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end increased 10.6% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 5.7%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 4.6%. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support the scheduled new store openings re-banners and our sales initiatives for the second quarter. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at quarter end decreased 3.8% from the same period last year, and decreased 3% on a selling square foot basis. ","Capital expenditures were $209.2 million in the first quarter versus $180.9 million in the first quarter of last year.

","Depreciation and amortization totaled $151.2 million for the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $151.5 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2019 we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $635 million to $645 million. ","Our updated outlook for fiscal 2019 includes the following assumptions: Calendar considerations for the remainder of the year include that there will be six fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas which will negatively impact Q4 sales. Our guidance includes the expectation that Section 301 tariffs will be 25% on List 1, 2, and 3 goods; however, our guidance does not include potential tariffs on List 4 goods. ","Our company outlook on March 6, 2019 included $95 million in discreet costs related to our Family Dollar store optimization initiative and our store support center consolidation. With the increased visibility of our cadence of projects, we now expect to incur approximately 90% of these costs in the first half of the year. In Q1 we incurred approximately 28 million for these initiatives. Our Q2 outlook includes an estimated $57 million in costs related to these initiatives. ","As noted with our company outlook on March 6, we did not include charges to release obligation in related expenses for any closed stores in 2019 as we could not estimate the P&L impact until after the adoption of ASC 842, the new lease accounting standards. We now expect to incur approximately $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share of costs in Q2 related to store closings release obligations and related costs. ","We entered into new import fright contracts affected May 1 based on negotiations in April. The new contracts were unfavorable compared to our prior outlook and will add approximately $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share of expense in the back half of the year, that was not included in our original company outlook for fiscal 2019 provided on March 6. ","We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on competitive markets, state increasing minimum wages and then completing the company's initiatives plans. We expect year-over-year domestic freight costs as a percentage of sales to increase in the first half of the year and then flatten out in the second half.

Our guidance assumes a tax rate of 22.6% for the second quarter and 22.4% for fiscal 2019.","Weighted average diluted share accounts are assumed to 238.6 million share for Q2 and 238.8 million shares for the full year. For the second quarter we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.66 billion to $5.76 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.64 to $0.73. These estimates are based on a low single digit increase in same store sales and includes approximately $57 million of discrete costs. Additionally as in I noted, our outlook now includes approximately $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share of costs related to Q2 store closures, release obligations and related costs that was not included in the company's previous outlook.","For fiscal 2019 we're now forecasting total sales to range between $23.51 billion and $23.83 billion based on a low single digit same store sales increase of approximately 1% selling square footage growth. ","The company anticipates GAAP net income per diluted share for full year fiscal 2019 will range between $4.77 and $5.07, which includes discrete costs of $95 million or $0.31 per share as previously disclosed. Additionally our outlook now includes $30 million or $0.10 per diluted share in store closure related costs and import freight costs of $15 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to increase of import freight rates as previously described in our updated outlook. ","I'll now turn the call back over to Gary. ","Gary Philbin ","Thanks Kevin. Before turning the call to your questions, I\u2019d like to share some information about our Dollar Tree Plus! test. As announced last quarter, we are conducting a test by lifting the Dollar price point restriction. Testing is not new to us and we got a long track record of using an analytical approach to challenge our own thinking. It's that kind of approach and process that led to the development of our H2 stores at Family Dollar and gave us the confidence to accelerate our store optimization program across the Family Dollar portfolio. ","We spent the past several months laying the groundwork for this test, carefully and thoughtfully designing a test that we believe will allow us to measure the impact of different price points, items and categories and shopping behavior, store profitability and our loyal customer\u2019s affinity for the Dollar Tree brand. ","We'll be leveraging Family Dollar and Dollar Tree distribution center systems and combined merchandise to efficiently get the new products into Dollar Tree stores without disrupting our normal operations. For the test we have selected the sales stores located in urban, suburban and rural markets and we'll be measuring the performance versus prior results, as well as against our control stores in similar markets. ","As part of the planning for the test, our Dollar Tree team has been working closely with the Family Dollar merchants to identify the right products to include. We'll be offering a range of items across a number of categories. We'll be testing primarily at price points of $3, $4 and $5 and the price will be displayed in 4 foot sections or end caps clearly branded as Dollar Tree Plus! in order to minimize confusion with our dollar values that our customers have come to expect. ","We believe the Wow! factor of what we have created at Dollar Tree should carry over to this test and continue to build our brand. This is not raising items from our Dollar price point to a higher retail. This is about adding new items and categories to add sales and margin. ","The test officially launched a few weeks ago with products hitting the shelves of the first batch of stores. We are in the process of rolling it out to more than 100 test stores and will measure, analyze and adjust products, layout and other variables to ensure we are responding to customer feedback and our continued merchandising efforts. Because it\u2019s an iterative process we do not have a set time frame for the test. It\u2019s in the early days right now, but we will have more details to share on our progress in the future. ","Lastly, my thanks to all of our store teams that are engaged daily to deliver great service and value to our customers and I call out to all of our Family Dollar team members that are in the process of moving, while we can consolidate campuses, who are staying on to train as necessary. I'm proud of everyone's efforts and achievements during this first quarter. ","Now we're ready to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you, Sir. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Robbie Ohmes","Hi, good morning guys. My question is actually on the H2 format, and I guess you know maybe Gary and maybe Duncan should answer this. But just could you guys talk through, you know so you put party freezer and cooler in there. You are getting a 10 point comp lift. How far could you go with the Dollar Tree assortment over time would be one question.","Another question is can you tell us how bringing that assortment into the H2 format changes the store level operating dynamics. Does it change the payroll structure significantly, you know what is sort of the expected you know EBIT margin look like for a family dollar store that's in the H2 format. Thanks. ","A - Gary Philbin","Hi Robbie, I'll start and hand it over to Duncan. You know from the standpoint of what H2 has done, it's put in some key dollars sections throughout the store and you know the opportunity there is just to leverage what we've done at Dollar Tree for years and it gives our customer the opportunity to see these great values. ","Obviously we've added more frozen food doors that drives traffic, because you pointed out we've also expanded seasonal party. We have a queuing line that sort of gives our customer the last chance to find great values. ","Let me turn it to Duncan on what we see is part of the opportunity to keep driving sales. We\u2019re pretty proud of a 10 comp in this fleet of stores, and you know we're going to continue to drive some additional efforts to see how high it can go, but Duncan? ","Kevin Wampler","Yeah, thank Gary. Thank you, Robbie for your question. As Gerry stated, we're pretty excited about the success we've had to date. It's very exciting to the customers as well as our team members when we walk these stores. It's not uncommon to get hugs and thanks from both customers and store people because the people really enjoy the store environment, so we're very excited about it. ","Just one other thing I had noticed, that we did fix the adjacencies in these stores to make our shopping experience much easier and thoughtful for our customer, and as we added the freezer and cooler doors with primarily food and dairy, we also added six doors of the immediate consumption products which drive good gross margin for our business. Really in there is the soft drinks, the teas, the waters, the flavored energy drinks that are so popular amongst our customer, and where appropriately we also added all beverages which drives quick traffic for our primary customer, so we're very excited about that. ","We do have 21 sections across the store with the Dollar Tree items in the store and a number of things it does is it creates a halo of strong price impression for our customers and we get feedback that says it looks like prices are lower and we're getting great engagement from our customer in those sections, but the real magic there is that the categories are actually starting to rise. It\u2019s not just the dollar sections alone, but we get better penetrations in categories that we have seen in our traditional format, so we\u2019re very excited about that.","We provide additional labor when we reset these stores just because of the workload and then we want to make sure that we don't \u2013 we test how high is high with this. So we do invest additional labor, but then we lean the store back off and let it self-fund. Within about four weeks it can get on a self-funding basis. ","We train one specific person in the store to handle the Dollar Tree items, because they are different and they behave differently than our family dollar products. They are not planogrammed, they are \u2013 we show them a section flow, so the work is relatively easy and also allows us to get in and get out of these categories pretty quickly without disappointing a customer and so I would tell you that we're very bullish on what we're seeing today, both from the store teams, the labor and how it bounces right back to the stores pretty quickly and the customer interaction. ","Robbie Ohmes","So if I dreamed a dream, is the more you know \u2013 you know these are smaller stores, but the more Dollar Tree assortment you get into a H2 family dollar, does the EBIT margin of that store start to look more and more like a Dollar Tree store EBIT margin? ","Kevin Wampler ","Robbie, this is Kevin. I think as we think about it, obviously we're working to drive top line first and foremost right, because that helps leverage all of our fixed costs at the end of the day. We got a limited number of stores we completed this time; still a lot of work going on. The freezers and coolers adult beverage tend to drive a little bit lower margin at the end of the day. We\u2019d have to offset that with the party and the things like that. So it's a little bit too early given the small number of stores in general, but I think in general obviously we\u2019re looking for any EBITDA lift. ","I don't think that the model is built such that whoever has the EBITDA of A Dollar Tree store, just given the amount of consumables we sell to our core customer for our family dollar banners versus a discretionary business we have in our Dollar Tree business. They will never \u2013 you know they are never going to quite equate at the end of the day, but the idea obviously to drive sales and drive improvements in that overall EBITDA margin as we go forward. ","Robbie Ohmes","Very helpful, thanks so much guys. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ","Brad Thomas ","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to follow up on the H2 performance; really encouraging. I guess when you look at Family Dollar here for this quarter, could you talk a little bit about how much of the comp lift you're seeing was explicitly from some of the initiatives that you have in place versus maybe just the cadence of the overall consumer. And as you are looking out through the balance of the year, do you still believe these initiatives are going to be 1.5% tailwind to comps for Family Dollar or is there a reason to perhaps get a little more optimistic at this point? ","Gary Philbin","Brad, thanks for your question. We\u2019re excited about what we're seeing really across the portfolio. I will tell you that this is just not H2 driven. This is really watching the entire performance of the company going up and that was demonstrated by seven or eight of our lines of businesses, positive comp in six of our seven zones, so we\u2019re seeing a nice balance across the chain. ","H2 obviously is a highlight amongst where we're investing in those dollars when we get that nice lift and we believe that is a sustainable lift as we start to continue to roll this across the United States and in most of our store base over time. ","I will tell you that we\u2019ve had great balance across our promotional sales, our baseline sales and when we're preparing to close some of these stores, we\u2019re seeing some good clearance sales. So we're getting a real nice balanced approach, so we feel good about that. The key here is the base business is solid. ","Brad Thomas ","Great, thank you very much. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question for Michael Lasser with UBS. ","Michael Lasser ","Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. If we back out the $0.15 of incremental one-time items from your guidance, the midpoint is going up $0.02, but the high end of the range is coming down quite significantly, why is that? ","A - Kevin Wampler","Well, I think if you look at the guidance Michael from you know where we started at for the year, basically if you take the fact that on a GAAP basis for the quarter you'd have to reduce the high end by $0.03 and you'd basically bring up the low end by I believe it was $0.08, and so you have that adjustment and then beyond that it's just the range always narrows as you go further down into the quarter, further into the year, you know three quarter less, so we had roughly a $0.40 range when we first started the year. We\u2019re now down to a $0.30 range, but then otherwise to your point it\u2019s just initiatives. ","The two new items that we brought in, so I don't think there's anything to read into other than that. You know from my perspective we didn't \u2013 the only changes to the guidance were for the lease obligation cost that we brought in again as we noted. We couldn't give you those at the beginning of the year given the fact that we had to adopt and implement a ASC 842 before we even calculated those costs and then obviously the new item with the new contracts on our import freight. ","Michael Lasser ","And Kevin, should we still be expecting 14% to 18% EPS growth into next year and what number should we be basing that growth off of? Should we be excluding the incremental $0.15 hit from those items that you mentioned? ","A - Kevin Wampler","Michael, you know I think the backdrop of our outlook in March, you know we wanted to give a little longer term outlook given you know the significant investment we were making in this year, in particularly around the initiatives to drive a group performance in our Family Dollar stores and we\u2019re obviously very focused on all of our store initiatives and the projects and Gary and Duncan had described, we\u2019re making really good progress and we like where we\u2019re going there, so that's very, very positive.","You know to give another point time, I think \u2013 I don't think we've changed necessarily our view point. We said at that point in time that it was based upon the GAAP number. We haven\u2019t really updated anything at this point, so I think it's \u2013 you know I don't think anything's changed and we\u2019ll just continue to update you probably later in the year once as we continue to work forward through this. Through this year and we\u2019ll have more data to work with. ","A - Gary Philbin","And Michael, this is Gary. From my perspective as we go through this year with that the initiatives we\u2019ve called out, we're closing almost 400 Family Dollar stores. The big investment in the H2\u2019s will go a long way first half-second half as we build momentum at the Family Dollar.","For Dollar Tree, you know I'm pretty proud of what the team's accomplished with this quarter and overcoming the 25% tariffs and you know we see ourselves chugging along here with the season still responding the way we like to see them come through with great sell-throughs and our customers responding and we\u2019re set up in a nice way for the summer season after having some good spring sales on Mother's Day and Easter. ","So you know those two things together, I think as we go through the back half of the year we'll see the momentum in the second half. ","Michael Lasser ","And can I just clarify one thing. We recognize that you didn\u2019t include the final list of tariffs in your guidance given all the uncertainty there. But can you help us understand the exposure? What percent of Dollar Tree's cost of goods come from China and would be at risk if the full list of tariffs go through? ","Gary Philbin","Well, here's how I think about it Michael. If I had sat down last September and tried to take you through our exposure on those three, I would have been wrong, because our team mitigated most of it, all of it you know as we went through our buying trips, and that's the approach we're taking on this list forward. ","Listen, I don't know when, how big, how much, what items are going to be excluded. We all know what hasn't been detailed out there. All I know is our team is doing the same process, running the same play. How do we mitigate and that's everything from what we buy, how we buy it, where we buy it, how we ship it? You know if we're going to use all those chapters in our play book to get to the right answer on it. So as it comes to pass or not, we\u2019ll keep the group updated, but we're not sitting back on this one. We\u2019re also figuring out how we mitigated if it comes to pass. ","Michael Lasser ","Thank you, and best of luck. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. ","Peter Keith","Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. So just to follow-up on Michael's question, with the current tariff exposure of good List 3, you guys did a really nice job of mitigating that impact. If there was broader exposure to the rest of the Dollar Tree business, are there differences with some of the other categories that may receive new tariff exposure that would limit your mitigation or is it sort of a similar approach that you would use for the whole store? ","Gary Philbin","Well, I think the way I \u2013 obvious it\u2019s \u2013 we import both banners, not all of it comes from China. The vast majority does of course and so the things that we even did back on our January trip, you know we moved $100 of seasonal buy out of China. We changed some of the specs that we were shipping items in, just so we could pack more in a case, more cases on a containers, so you could land it you know overcoming the tariff. We\u2019re looking at other countries. ","The process will be the same. I mean our merchants, now they have a pretty good \u2013 I will not wish this on us, but this made our merchants go and take a look at everything we're doing in terms of specing product, where we\u2019re buying it from negotiating, getting cost in a product and those are going to be the foundational elements as we go forward into this next round. ","Peter Keith","Okay, that's helpful feedback and maybe I want to pivot to the gross margins, that Family Dollar, specifically digging into the shrink headwind. So the shrink headwind has just continued to intensify over the last year. I guess looking at it on a two year stack basis, now in an 80 basis point headwind, could you give us your view and when we might begin to see the shrink stabilize and what are the steps you are taking in order to minimize that hit? ","Kevin Wampler","Yeah, this is Kevin. I\u2019ll give you some background. Obviously you know we're very disappointed in our results and we own that and you know we have not execute to the level we\u2019ve expected to, and this is \u2013 I would tell you this is not sitting on the corner of somebody's desk. This is front and center for everybody; you know the operations team, the loss prevention team, the logistics team, management.","You know I think one of the things we have fought a little bit is our inventory levels. Again, our inventory levels have grown what you saw for the first time this quarter, we're actually able to bring inventory levels down and that\u2019s going to be a continued effort there by Duncan and team as we look at that. ","We\u2019ve made changes in the reporting structure and leadership in regards to over looking at the Family Dollar banners with regards to our loss prevention team and how we are looking at that. You know we have put in place you know several new programs, we\u2019re putting in a new analytics software, we\u2019re doing a lot of things, and again as you know what we\u2019re working on now probably takes a little bit of time to see the benefit of, but you know my expectation is we see the effect of the negativity dissipate somewhat as we get towards the back half. ","Now we still have work to do. You know I think it\u2019s a disappointing trend, but I think there is a lot of work going on to really you know address this on an overall basis.","Peter Keith","Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Good luck. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. ","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get back to the profit dollars on the H2, it wasn\u2019t clear. Are EBITD dollars up in those stores or are flat or are they down, you know the ones you\u2019ve converted? ","Kevin Wampler","No, they are absolutely up.","Scott Mushkin","They are up, okay great. And then looking, I just wanted to poke a little bit more at this gross margin of Family Dollar. Where do you think we\u2019ve gone, obviously they\u2019ve come down a lot, Shrink\u2019s a part of it. So number one is, is that Shrink really just teething? What\u2019s the number one cause of that Shrink, and number two, as we balance Family Dollar gross margins any thought where we could come back up to? ","Kevin Wampler","I think as we look at our gross margin in Family Dollar, you kind of have to look at it in buckets, it\u2019s kind of the way I would think about it. So if you look at the \u2013 overall, we look at just the product margin, including freight. Obviously freight was a big headwind last year, a little bit of a headwind this year. In the first half we expect that to flatten out in the back half. ","As we look at the actual you know merchandise costs, a little bit of pressure obviously from selling more lower margin consumable goods, a lot of work going on to really energize the discretionary business, to help offset that. So that as we see that discretionary business continue to improve, I think we have the ability to offset that as we go forward. ","I think obviously you know markdown this year will be a very tough year with markdown, because obviously we have all the initiative markdowns going into the P&L. ","I think occupancy cost was actually a good point here in Q1. As I noted, excluding the $6.7 million related to the adoption of ASC 842, we actually would have shown a slight deleveraging of occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, so those things are positive. ","So I think we\u2019ll still see pressure as we go through this year in particular, because of some of the onetime cost and some of the initiatives things going on. I think as we get the sales, continue to see the sales improve, that helps leverage some of these things and gets us back on track to improving it to back to where we would like to see. ","Gary Philbin","Scott, this is Gary. Let me just give you my color on it, because of the way I think about it, the things around our logistics costs, you know the shortage of truck drivers was impact this year, that will level out in the back half. The DC\u2019s, listen we\u2019ve paid out more just to get people to work in distribution centers, but our productivity over time will catch that up and surpass it. ","Shrink, we have everybody on a red alert, that\u2019s controllable. And where does it come from? Well, as any good retail you look inside and outside, but we just got to be smarter on responding to it more quickly, and Duncan and team are working a lot to get our folks trained. ","But the margin piece, here is still the opportunity that I think we \u2013 besides what we are doing at H2, you know we still are working real hard on private brands. We have a pretty good base level penetration, but it\u2019s going to grow more over time. ","In the import piece, what we\u2019ve continued to work on, you know with the Chinese tariffs its shining even a brighter light on the opportunities there, and not just the fact that they were buying some items in China, but when we get a chance to move something from a domestic to FOB China, to finding the folks that actually make it all enhances the margin there. We still got a runaway there, and that\u2019s the upside opportunity at Family Dollar on the margins side. ","Scott Mushkin","Alright guys. Thanks for the thorough answer, really appreciate it. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. Question on the Dollar Tree Plus!, really two questions. First, philosophically why are you not testing $2, but focusing on $3 and $5, just trying to understand that, and then number two, how much of the store or SKU base will be, let\u2019s call it re-priced as you run through that test? Thanks.","Gary Philbin","Well, couple of important points, Scot. I mean, you may see some $2 in there. I think the point I was trying to make is, we\u2019re going to see full price points. You are not going to see $3.25, you\u2019re not going to see $4.65, I think our customer, we\u2019re going to make this very easy for her to figure out as we go through it. ","And, I just want to emphasize, we\u2019re not raising retails on the dollar items that our folks have come to love and count on, and I\u2019ve gotten more letters from school teachers that are, threatening me in a nice way that I don\u2019t dare do that. ","But, I think our opportunity here is to find some additional categories items, that can add to the sales, and that\u2019s really the intent of this. Does our customer understand the wow! Factor, that we work so hard on all these years to make Dollar Tree a breakthrough brand in America, and can we take that wow! factor and put it into the store and make our customers understand it and they understand it wow! as we lift the dollar price point. ","So, I think it\u2019s going to be very clear to the customer, what these items are. They\u2019ll see the items, with a sticker on them or pre-priced in some fashion that will be very clear to them. And our folks are being trained to answer all those questions. We want our customers when they raise their hand and say how much is this? It\u2019s not going to be because they\u2019re confused on the price, it\u2019s going to be because they still see these incredible values. ","So, well we\u2019re all over this in terms of getting good execution first during a rollout, what do we learn as we do that, and then following up with customer feedback as we go through the process.","Scot Ciccarelli","Yes, the full price point certainly makes sense. And how much of the store SKU base will be let\u2019s call it changed?","Gary Philbin","Well, I mentioned you\u2019re going to see, let\u2019s just say 100 plus SKU\u2019s and listen the same way we do at Dollar Tree today you\u2019re going to see items come and go, buy it while you see it. It\u2019s not always going to be there. And so, when you think about the SKU base, you never going to start someplace and probably end up skating somewhere else, but that\u2019s about where we\u2019re going to start and just learn as we go.","Scot Ciccarelli","Alright. Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Hi, good morning. Appreciate all the color on updated outlook and margins. But, I wanted to just follow-up and just maybe get a little bit more detail on specific expectations for 2Q versus the second half on some of those key items like freight and shrink, payroll. ","If you can just give us a little bit more detail on how we should think about the cadence?","Kevin Wampler","Yes, I mean, I think freight we\u2019ve been fairly transparent on a [inaudible] from a domestic standpoint. We\u2019ve said it\u2019s a headwind in the first half of the year. I believe it becomes, you know basically flat in the second half. ","We\u2019ve seen just some, from an overall perspective inbound has started to regulate itself a little bit, it seems like domestic still running a little high and then obviously we gave you the news on the import, which sits about $0.05, but it\u2019s back half related, if you think about that. ","Payroll in general, you know again store hourly payroll is going to continue to basically be up slightly as we go through the year probably no different than what we saw in Q1. We continue to see from an employment standpoint an increase in average hourly rate in our stores, and I think that\u2019s part of it. ","So we have that, and then I think from a shrink perspective as I said, I think it\u2019s likely to continue to be up in Q2. My view is we need to see that start to level out as we get to the second half.","Now I think as the other thing to remind everybody is, initially when we were talking about the costs related to the initiatives at the beginning of the year, we said about 75% of those costs would be incurred in the first half of the year. We are now - today we said roughly 90% of those costs would be incurred in the first half. ","So based upon the fact that we can, we\u2019ve seen the cadence and the efficiency we\u2019ve gained there and how our projects are laying out for the year, we\u2019ve been able to see that and obviously it gives us that foundational base of the $57 million of cost that we\u2019re going to see in Q2 related to all those initiatives, and those touch many, many lines, it touches labor, it touches markdowns, it touches various other costs as well. ","So those are all kind of blended in there at the end of the day, Paul.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And then, bigger picture, as we think about the fact you are doing a lot of remodels, closing a number of Family Dollar stores. Just want to take a step back and get your current outlook on the opportunity still for new door growth in the Dollar store industry? Maybe speak to new store productivity that you\u2019re seeing today and just where the wide space is?","Gary Philbin","Hey Paul, this is Gary. So we had said a few years ago 25,000 domestic US and a 1,000 in Canada. I think on the US side, I still see that opportunity, it\u2019s going to be both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, and I think as we\u2019ve learned about the business the opportunity to build Family Dollars, we were probably 60\/40 even closer to 70\/30 urban versus rural over time. I see that\u2019s switching, I see our Greenfield for Family Dollar being more rural than urban. ","I don\u2019t know, if they will switch, you know to a percentage of 70\/30, but probably closer to something like that over time. And I think the opportunity is what we\u2019ve called out, what we deliver is a great box shopping environment, items that people need, that as independent drug stores, grocery stores or other retailers are you know are failing it gives us an opportunity to grow, for really both banners, but at Family Dollar, that\u2019s an opportunity in rural America.","I think Dollar Tree continues to be one of the great brands in America, it cuts through the clutter, we still see the same opportunity across the broad middle of - we can go anywhere, but Family Dollar probably works best inside the Beltway and in the extreme rural, and for Dollar Tree we still see plenty of opportunities. ","I think you make a good point, we\u2019re spending a lot of time and energy on the 1,000 renovations this year on H2, we got at 1000, we\u2019re hardly talking about snack zones, but we are touching 1,000 Dollar Trees as well. But the opportunity to build more doors is there is going to switch more to that in the years.","when you take a look at the number of stores, we'll have touched on H2 renovations this year, a 1,000, the new stores behind us by the time we get through end of next year, we\u2019re going to be closing in somewhere close to 40% of our Family Dollar fleet having been touched through our renovation or being new in the last four years or so. ","So, that\u2019s going to be a change from what our customers have seen in the past. So we\u2019re bullish on why H2 can do for us, where it can operate, where we can grow it, and for Dollar Tree we continue to be as always selective on the right sites for Dollar Tree. But, it\u2019s still a growth story for both banners as we look forward.","Paul Trussell","Thank you, best of luck.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","For Gary or Duncan, when you guys think about the Family Dollar\u2019s organization\u2019s capacity right for change, and particularly on the real-estate side, are you thinking about the 1,000 renovations, is that sort of the max, can the platform handle more than that, and then the success of that, you know does that when you think about the bell curve on store performance, once you closed the stores, you\u2019re going to close this year, we basically through now because of the H2 promise, another round of closings next year or beyond?","Duncan Mac Naughton","Hi, John, it\u2019s Duncan, thanks for the question. I will tell you that the Dollar Tree enterprise team actually based here in Chesapeake, really runs and leads all the store development work across the country for both of the banners, and it\u2019s supported locally obviously with the folks that are in the field, a mixture of both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar people.","But, I will tell you that we are nowhere near our capacity here. As you know we\u2019re also adding freezers and coolers across the chain, we\u2019re adding a 1,000 licenses and beverages at Family Dollar, we\u2019re doing the 1,000 snack zones that Gary talked about, lead 200 stores, new stores at Family Dollar, 350 at Dollar Tree. ","I think, as we get more stores on the ground in H2, we\u2019re also are getting much more efficient and how to handle with this both with our teams, as well as our suppliers to make these things go faster. ","I will tell you and looking forward, I know that we will typically close 70 to 80 stores a year just based on normal store closures and maintenance of where the store performance is.","Gary Philbin","John, it\u2019s Gary. Just from the standpoint of store closures, we take a look at what needed to close outside of lease term and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in the second quarter of this year. As always, we take a look at the end of lease term for our fleet of stores to figure out how do we optimize? Where they are headed for? And actually reaching out for our landlords to get, input and contributions from them to, you know now help us reinvigorate some of their properties on H2 as we go forward. ","So, we\u2019ll be doing more of that, but as we go forward, second quarter is going to be where we, I\u2019ll take the hit on the stores closing out lease as we go through the out-years, either it\u2019s 75 to 100 depending on the number of stores coming up on any quarter is probably closer to where we\u2019ll end up.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mr. Randy Guiler for any additional or closing remarks.","Randy Guiler","Thank you, Aaron. Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call and especially your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss Q2 results is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 29th, 2019.
