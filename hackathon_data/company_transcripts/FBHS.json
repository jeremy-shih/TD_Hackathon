At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fortune Brands Home & Security Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Brian Lantz, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. You may begin your conference.","Brian Lantz","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Fortune Brands Home & Security quarterly investor conference call and webcast.","We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress during the second quarter of 2013. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release issued earlier. The news release and the audio replay of the webcast of this call can be found in the Investors section of our fbhs.com website.","I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements we make on the call today, either on our prepared remarks or in the associated question-and-answer session, are based on current expectations and the market outlook, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated.

Following our prepared remarks, we have allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We delivered strong second quarter sales and profit growth that capped off our first half of the year that was even better than planned. We have developed solid momentum by focusing on profitable growth as we continue to leverage the market recovery and our competitive advantages. We are now positioned to drive incremental shareholder value, and we are well positioned for the second half of the year.","Importantly, based on our strong performance, our continued positive outlook on the market and our efficient closing of the WoodCrafters acquisition, we are again increasing our annual outlook.","Let me first spend some time on the quarter highlights, and then I'll discuss our increased annual outlook.","For the quarter, sales were up 11% and EPS was $0.41, up from $0.29 a year ago. Importantly, for our 3 housing-related segments, we saw total sales increase 13% for the quarter, well ahead of the overall market for our products as we continue to gain share on our categories.","Now let me give you some highlights by segment. Sales for our cabinets business were up 13% for the quarter. We exceeded our expectations as we gained share in all channels and benefited from both new construction and repair and remodel.","The pace of new construction remained a key driver as we again saw strength with dealers and builders in our new construction lines. However, as R&R spending improved over last year, we also saw growth more broadly across a fuller range of our semi-custom lines. We are leveraging our structural competitive advantages, including our portfolio of brands, the continuous stream of innovation and our service-oriented operating platform to generate sustainable momentum. We gained share in both the dealer channel, where we're the clear market leader, and in home centers, where we saw particular strength in our in-stock cabinet and bath vanity programs.","Notably, we grew our Cabinet profits by $17 million in the quarter, nearly doubling last year's second quarter profit. This performance, again, reflects our ability to successfully target profitable growth and leverage our efficient operating platform to improve profitability.","Plumbing sales were up 15% in the quarter. Moen, again, saw broad sales gains in the U.S. and in our international businesses, particularly China. Gains were strongest in the U.S. in our wholesale business driven largely by the pace of new construction. Our leading market share with the top builders and wholesalers and our strategy to expand on multifamily segment are yielding share gains and solid profit growth.","Moen also saw double digit gains at retail with our steady pace of consumer-driven innovations like MotionSense, a unique hands-free electronic kitchen faucet, our Microban antimicrobial finishes and new styles, like our Ashville and Banbury bath lines.","Internationally, sales in China, where there are now more than 800 Moen-branded stores, were again up strong double digits over the prior year driven by continued gains in direct-to-builder, performance of the existing Moen store footprint and our continued store expansion. The team in China continues to build our business with a wider range of price points and with products uniquely tailored to the Chinese market, and the Chinese consumer continues to spend in our category. Windows & Doors sales were up 11% for the quarter. Door products saw sales growth of 15%, driven by gains in new construction and our ongoing distribution expansion. Windows sales were 6%, driven by a better repair and remodel market and share gains in our dealer, West, and home center channels.","In the Security & Storage segment, our sales were relatively even with the prior year quarter with strong profit growth. Security sales were up mid-single digits to the prior year quarter with strength in U.S. retail, international and global safety.","Master Lock innovation continues to hit the mark in both retail and commercial with new updated versions of well-established product lines and exciting new line extensions. We also continued to roll out our new line of commercial electronic access-control solutions designed to secure high-value sites, such as cellular telephone towers and other storage facilities. Tool storage sales were down in the quarter as we continue to reposition the business. However, sales for the second half of the year should be positive to prior year as we begin to benefit from the first half repositioning.","So to sum up the second quarter performance, I'm excited about our performance versus a market which continues to be led by significantly stronger new construction, and a repair and remodel market that continues to show signs of improved growth. This performance demonstrates the strength of our operating model and our ability to generate profitable growth as volume returns and we continue to gain share. We also closed our WoodCrafters acquisition late in the second quarter. The integration is fully underway, and, as expected, the acquisition will add incremental sales and earnings per share in 2013. And as expected, we are on track for strong performance in 2014. We intend to continue to be efficient with our cash by investing in our businesses, pursuing accretive strategic acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all with the single focus of increasing shareholder value. We are excited about the WoodCrafters acquisition, which will allow us to build on our competitive advantage in Cabinets, particularly as the repair and remodel market gains momentum.","This is a great time to enhance our leadership position in Cabinets and further strengthen our efficient and responsive North American supply chain.","Let me now turn to our outlook for 2013. Lee will then take you through our outlook in more detail in a few moments.","From a market perspective, we see an overall market for our U.S. home products that continues to show strong momentum in new construction and improvement in repair and remodel. New construction remains robust as demand for new homes outstrip supply in many markets across the country. It is also encouraging to see the pace of repair and remodel activity improving even in the areas that have been lagging, such as semi-custom cabinets and replacement windows.","Our revised 2013 outlook remains built on a fundamental assumption that the U.S. home products market grows at a combined 8% to 10% rate. Based on that market assumption, continued share gains and the WoodCrafters acquisition, we now expect our 2013 full year sales to increase at a 13% to 15% rate over 2012, with our home products businesses growing faster and our Security & Storage business growing slower. We expect our 2013 EPS before charges\/gains to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.43.","So to sum up, we had another quarter of strong results, and our first half sales and profit growth was better than we initially expected due to improving market and solid execution. We are confident in our ability to continue to outperform our market and we have again raised our outlook for 2013. We are also now positioned to drive incremental shareholder value and have closed on our first acquisition.","Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our strong free cash flow.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our revised 2013 outlook.","E. Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains, which best reflects ongoing business performance. Let me start with our second quarter results.","Sales were $1.04 billion, up 11% from a year ago, with our home product sales growing 13%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $107 million, up 48% or $34 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.41 for the quarter, up 41% or $0.12 versus the same quarter last year.","Now let me provide a little more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $392 million, up $46 million or 13% over the prior year quarter with growth in all channels. Operating income for the segment almost doubled to $35 million, up $17 million as we benefited from higher sales volume running through our improving supply chain.","Our strategy of disciplined sales growth is working as planned, as we continue to exceed the overall Cabinet market growth while improving profitability. We are seeing broader growth in our semi-custom cabinet lines as R&R spending improved over last year. Plumbing sales for the second quarter were $323 million, up $41 million or 15% versus the prior year quarter. All channels, again, performed well with the U.S. wholesale, U.S. retail and China businesses all experiencing double digit sales growth.","Operating income was $55 million, up 29%, even as we made incremental brand investments. And importantly, operating margin was 17.1%, 190 basis points higher than the same quarter last year.","Windows & Doors sales were $176 million, up $17 million or 11% from the prior year quarter. Within this segment, the Door business experienced 15% sales growth, while the Window business grew 6%. Operating profit for this segment more than doubled to $10 million, $6 million better than last year. For the full year, we see significant improvement over last year's profit.","Second quarter Security & Storage sales were at $149 million, relatively even with the prior year quarter. Security sales increased 4% and were offset by lower sales of tool storage products. Segment operating income increased 25% to $26 million driven primarily by changes to our benefit structure, as we align all of our benefit programs ahead of implementation of the new healthcare law, less other investments in the business to support new product launches and line extensions.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our June 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash at $124 million, debt of $386 million and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 0.7x. We have $60 million drawn on our $650 million revolving credit facility. The June 30 balance sheet reflects the closing of the WoodCrafters acquisition for approximately $300 million, and the payment of our first dividend.","Additionally, in July, we extended the maturity of our existing credit agreement to 5 years in order to maintain our flexibility. The facility capacity continues at $1 billion, with a $650 million revolver and a $350 million term loan. We've retained the same strong bank group and the favorable terms of the original agreement.","Now let me mention a couple of recent actions as we begin to use cash to drive incremental returns to shareholders. First, as Chris mentioned, we closed our WoodCrafters cabinet acquisition quickly, integration is fully underway and the transaction will deliver incremental sales and earnings per share in 2013.","Second, we paid our first dividend on June 19. The dividend reflects our confidence in ongoing cash flows.","As we have previously stated, over an assumed 5-year time horizon beginning in 2012, for the housing market to return to a steady state, our strong free cash flow combined with our flexible balance sheet, should provide over $2 billion of cash to drive incremental shareholder value.","Let me now provide further details on our revised outlook for 2013. As discussed previously, our approach to the 2013 planning and annual outlook begins with a market assumption. Our approach also includes continued share gains in addition to the overall market growth. Also, we've now included 3% sales growth and $0.04 of incremental earnings per share to our revised annual outlook due to the WoodCrafters acquisition. Due to timing of cost associated with the acquisition, we should realize $0.01 in the third quarter and $0.03 in the fourth quarter. As we said last quarter, WoodCrafters annual sales are approximately $230 million, and for the full year 2014, the acquisition should add an incremental $0.11 to $0.13 of EPS to our overall performance.","So based on our first half performance and market assumption, continued share gains and the WoodCrafters acquisition, we expect our total company full year 2013 sales to increase 13% to 15% compared to 2012. We should, again, outperform our market with all segments increasing. Our expectations for EPS are now in the range of $1.35 to $1.43. The midpoint of our guidance represents an increase of 56% over 2012 EPS of $0.89.","2013 free cash flow should be in the range of $240 million to $275 million after CapEx of approximately $108 million. In summary, our business model is performing well, and we're pleased with our strong second quarter and first half performance. This momentum should continue into the second half of the year, as we benefit from our structural competitive advantages and the market recovery generates additional growth.","Importantly, this sustainable momentum, in both the housing market and in our business performance, should allow us to create incremental shareholder value by making selective acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks for the second quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I just wanted to start off with a question about Kitchen & Bath Cabinetry. I guess, first of all, can you give us a sense for what we're seeing there in terms of mix versus cost versus maybe a reduction in promotional actions? Obviously, the margin improved handily. Just want to try to get some handle on how you would rate the improvement in profitability up into those 3 categories?","Christopher J. Klein","I'll start with just a little bit of background. I think, overall, we've seen promotion continue to decrease. As you know, we started back about 1.5 years ago being a little bit more constrained on that, and I think that's worked well. Across our channels, dealer continues to perform very strongly, and so we're seeing a good mix come out of there. And then on the home center side, we're also seeing strong performance in our in-stock category, as well as our semi-custom side. On the builder side, there's a lot of demand out there on the direct-to-builder side, but we also pick up a pretty good mix coming out of the dealer channel, and that tends to be a little bit richer even than on the direct-to-builder side. Lee, I don't know if you have anything else?","E. Lee Wyatt","No, I think that's right. I think it's across the board. We're getting leverage on the volume and 9% operating margin in the quarter.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, that sounds great. It sounds like it's pretty much strong across the board. I guess, if I could, ask another question related to what you're seeing in renovation and -- well, particularly residential larger-ticket remodel. You indicated that you were seeing some continued strength or some continued signs of improvement in that market. Is there anything in particular that you would point to sort of within the numbers? Obviously, you could just look at the sales growth, it would seem to suggest that things are picking up. But is there anything in particular maybe sort of swimming beneath the numbers that you would also pall out that gives you some hopeful signs -- or indicate the hopeful sign that we're starting to see an improvement in larger-ticket residential remodel?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. I'd say the most encouraging thing is in the semi-custom side of the market, which is special order at both home centers and Kitchen & Bath dealers, kind of the heart of the market, semi-custom is really picking up. I'd say if we're sitting here 9 months ago, we're talking a lot about the value end of that market, which is still -- semi-custom is still designed for the project. But really it was much more pure value focus. Now we're actually starting to see a pickup in the higher margin product, kind of the richer mix. A lot of our innovation, frankly, is getting picked up on finishes, different wood species and so that's starting to improve. And I'd say the thing that's the most different is probably that, and that's an encouraging sign. It's not all the way back. I think we still have some headroom to grow. And in fact, on the higher-end custom, I think we're still a way from where we should be steady state. But we can see some momentum coming through.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Chris, just on the Cabinet, the incrementals. If you look at the first half of the year, the incrementals, I think, are above what you've talked about that business maybe normalizing to and what you've seen historically. Any sense that you're becoming more optimistic that you can see better leverage than what you've seen historically with a couple quarters of growth kind of behind you and able to see what the business does and how the volume drops down?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. It tends to kind of ebb and flow a little bit. I mean, we're, I think, certainly encouraged with the kind of leverage we're seeing, but I'm not sure that it's a straight line up because we -- some of it is mix, and so I'm not sure that you can just extrapolate it through. But I'd say we are encouraged, as we have talked about, that we should be seeing leverage between 25%, 30% and we should be moving toward kind of the steady-state margin in the kind of 14%, 15% range. And so, I think, we're encouraged that we're headed toward that. And you can see a stronger quarter. You can see it back off a little bit, but I kind of look at it over more of a kind of a rolling average. And on that basis, I think we're encouraged.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Would it be fair to say that the leverage you've seen in the Cabinets for the first half of the year is better than what you would have expected for that given level of sales at the beginning of the year?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. I think, back to what I was talking about earlier, that the mix that we're seeing coming out of that core semi-custom is stronger than we would have thought at the beginning of the year and that's encouraging. And I think if that continues, we'll be on a better pace than we thought, so I think that's probably the most significant change from where we were in the beginning.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then you mentioned double-digit growth at retail for the Moen brand. Is there any differentiation between shipments and POS?","Christopher J. Klein","No, I think it's actually pretty healthy. I'd look across both retail and wholesale and say it's pretty healthy that there's not a lot of inventory build out there. On the wholesale side, which is feeding new construction, we're shipping it in and they're selling it out, so it's a pretty good velocity return there. On the retail side, I think we've talked and I think the home centers have talked about they've been pretty disciplined about kind of making sure there's enough inventory in the system, but not getting too far out ahead. I'd say the most encouraging thing in our growth at Moen retail has just been our new products are really driving a lot of that. And the pick up on new products is encouraging because that tends to be kind of our stronger performing.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And just last question kind of wrapped into that. Are using, inclusive of new product, a favorable mix within the faucet category as well?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. I think -- yes, it's good. We're not driving growth as maybe some others are in the industry by just selling in at a lower cost. We're getting a good rich mix come through as we'd hope. And so, yes, I think it's as we thought it would be and it's quite strong.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to ask, and maybe this is more directed towards Lee. I was trying to understand how -- what's driving the increase in SG&A. It's like up $20 million -- $23 million, $24 million year-over-year. And I was just trying to think how much operating leverage is there to -- or what's your ability to leverage the SG&A line going forward?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. Bob, when you look at the quarter, SG&A is up about $25 million, about 10%. If you look at just kind of the normal volume and inflation piece of that, that's about 4.5% of the 10% increase, so a very manageable level. What we have done in the quarter is continue to invest in our initiatives to drive future growth, and that specifically means Moen advertising. So we increased Moen advertising in the quarter by $8 million. So that's the other big chunk of that, that we did. And we have some M&A kind of consulting that drove it up. So I think net-net, about 4.5% of the 10% growth was kind of core things that you're leveraging. Those others were discretionary decisions to invest in the business.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And if you could just give us a update on the WoodCrafters acquisition in terms of integration, and what you're seeing in terms of potential opportunities on a broad general sense, that would be terrific.","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. I'll take that. We closed the WoodCrafters about a month ago, and it's proceeding as planned. Everything is on schedule. It's terrific. They're a great group of associates joining us. Many of them based in Mexico, and so we've been working closely with them on integration and in working with our bigger customers. And it's terrific. So I think everything is on track. We're starting to develop the plans for kind of further opportunities, but the biggest concern right out of the gate is just making sure that it's as we thought it would be. And so I can report back, no surprises and everything's -- all systems go. It's terrific. We're very excited about it.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering, you talked about the storage business and some of the repositioning, the benefits coming the second half at least from a revenue prospective. Just wondering if you could comment at all in terms of just how we should think about that in terms of any impact on margins initially as some of that helps the revenue there?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. So within that business, we're doing a number of things in the beginning of the year to really launch some new products, better mix. And so some of that started to flow through the second quarter, but that's really positioning for the second half. That's a seasonal business and a lot of the impact comes kind of in the October, November point of the year. So we were setting up a lot of new programs to really give ourselves a lift there. So we should see some positive impact for the second half, and really, we saw the second quarter as really more of a repositioning quarter to set up that stronger second half.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then within that point of business which then transfers the growth there, and also the margin front. Further room in terms of expansion in the margins there, I think, in terms of pricing power or how do you think about that?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I think it's really mix driven. So I think as long as we continue to see the strong mix out of our wholesale group into new construction, which has been good, and the mix on the retail side to extend its supporting new products that tends to be pretty strong, too. So those are the 2 real big drivers in the business. And we have a steady cadence of new products that are going to continue to come into the market, so I'd expect that will continue. So it's really as long as the market holds up, we're set to deliver against it. And, yes, it's performing quite well this year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's actually Will Wong in for Mike. So my question is on the current M&A environment. I was just wondering if you guys could talk about any potential areas where you could see a potential M&A, and just what the market looks like currently?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. It's -- I'd say it's starting to wake up, and we get to see a lot of things. I mean, we're one of the most obvious strategic buyers for a number of different companies out there. So we're looking at a number of different things. I don't know that -- I mean, given that we just completed one, I don't know that anything else is imminent. But we're pretty deliberate. We're really trying to drive shareholder value here, so we're disciplined in terms of how we look at everything. And so, yes, I'd say the environment is picking up. I think there's more to come. I'd look out over the next 12, 18 months and say it will probably pick up even more. There are a number of companies that are family-owned that I think as they start to see some of the benefit of the recovery, will then think about maybe selling some private equity-owned companies may be out there, too. So I'd say we're going to take our time. We're going to continue to be disciplined, and really focus on just building the best company and driving shareholder. That's kind of the key to it all.","William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then you've talked about the Storage business in terms of repositioning in the second half. Now just longer term, what is the future plan for tool storage?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. Strategically, the category hasn't been that strong. We're looking at further opportunities to expand into the garage. We do have a line of garage storage cabinetry and other organizing type products, and we continue to look for opportunities to grow in that category. The core category of tool storage is in a very slow decline. So we're managing it today, really, for profitable growth and focused on cash generation. And so we'll look at something like repositioning the line to generate greater cash flow in the second half, and say that that's really where the business sits. And so that's -- it's kind of where the business is within the portfolio.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Can you just talk about wood price inflation in the Cabinet business, and, if possible, can you quantify the impact on the second quarter results?","E. Lee Wyatt","We would say that we have seen some inflation in the wood side. Remember, we're more hardwoods than we are just the lumber to build homes. But -- so we're seeing some inflation, of course. But I'd say, overall, it's been very manageable. With our brand strength and our service proposition, we have the ability to take price to offset those. So we feel very good about that, that over time we'll manage any inflation. But I would say, then, overall, general inflation for our company has been pretty modest in the quarter.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Is there any chance of quantifying that for us? Was it neutral or was it a small inflationary influence or...","E. Lee Wyatt","I would say that in the quarter that we basically offset any inflation with modest price increases.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, great. And then secondly, you talked about share gains across your various businesses. I wonder if I could just get you to elaborate a little further on that, maybe talk about where thought you gained the most and how you see that going forward?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. We can go through by business. I think we're looking at -- if you look at cabinets, we're looking at sales up 13% for the quarter. I think that category is probably high-single digits, so there was some significant movement there. Within that, I'd say dealers are strongest. We're picking up individual dealerships. We're expanding within dealerships to multiple lines, and we're seeing more activity there. On the home centers side, we're very active at selling directly into the designers. And that's something we've been really focused on over the last 12, 18 months, and moving away from just that heavy discount promotional environment into the more closer collaboration and that paid off. So those are the types of things. As you start to get a little bit of market momentum, frankly, you start to see the benefits of a lot of the position gains that we made over the last 3 years or so. You've seen some volume flow through there. With Moen, I think it's -- we've got a heavy representation with the large builders and within wholesale, and they're disproportionate, I think, winning relative to the overall market. And then on retail, I talked about some new products that are really helping us along there. Windows & Doors, I think the biggest thing there is we worked hard over the last 2 or 3 years to really expand distribution. And we're underrepresented in some regions across the country, and so that was pretty deliberate. And again, now you're seeing some volume flow through that market. And so you're seeing the share gains that are really the result of extending distribution deeper into the marketplace. So those are really kind of the highlights. And we've always grown a little bit farther ahead of the market. I think, as you see volume coming through the market, it tends to extend that out a little bit.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And so if I could just add on that last one. Within the Windows & Doors business, is your private label business in Doors expanding? Do you feel you're gaining share through that franchise?","Christopher J. Klein","I think it's really fine. I don't think it's growing any faster than the overall market. It's kind of keeping pace. I think the real piece there is the Tru 2-step wholesale distribution, the Therma-Tru branded door. We're the leader in the fiberglass at the high end. And that is doing quite well, and our distribution is very strong. And so that's just really setting to mark out there.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","2 questions for you. First of all, on the revenue guidance, can you go back to how you would break apart the remodel and the new construction within that? I know you've talked about remodel up, I think, to 4% or 5% and new up 25%. Within the updated guidance, any change in the mix or growth rates within those 2?","Christopher J. Klein","Not really. I mean, it's about -- I think, overall, we roll out the guidance to just about 8% to 10%. R&R might be a tick higher, and new construction might be about the same. It's not certainly any higher there. So to the extent there's any incremental on the marketplace, it's probably just a little bit better on R&R. Like for us, it's combination of, obviously, bringing WoodCrafters in, in the second half. And then there is a little bit of improved mix, obviously, we talked about especially on the Cabinets side. And then the second quarter, we outperformed where we thought we would be, so if you roll all that together and that really is the underpinning of the guidance.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Great. And then secondly, the incremental margins in Cabinets, I know were, again, ahead of what you've guided, but were a little bit less than the big numbers that you saw in the 4Q and 1Q, and I appreciate the comments that it kind of ebb and flow. But any guidance or thought you'd give us on why it was a little bit less upside on the incremental margin this quarter than the prior 2 quarters?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. To frame the whole discussion, it's always -- we talk about 25% to 30% increment on an ongoing basis, which gets us back to that 14-plus percent total company operating margin. Recall the first quarter, overall company, I think we were at 45% incremental, 55% in Cabinets. But that was on a very low volume base, so you get oversized leverage against the fixed cost in that first quarter, which is our lowest volume quarter. In the second quarter, we saw overall leverage at about 33% and we saw Cabinets at 37%. And we always kind of think as we leverage cabinets, is they'll be at the high end of that. So they were at 37%. That seems pretty reasonable to us. I think we also said on last quarter's call that we'd be probably closer to the higher end of the 25% to 30% for the full year, and I think we're kind of tracking there. But it does ebb and flow, and you can see it's coming down from, in Cabinets, 55% to 37% in the second quarter, getting much more kind of reasonable.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jim Barrett of CL King & Associates.","James Barrett - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Chris, I have a question on WoodCrafters. I mean, it appears to be a very strong high-quality acquisition at an attractive price. Given your acquisition pipeline and the quality of the companies that you are evaluating, should we think of WoodCrafters as a top-quartile type acquisition in terms of fit and brand quality, or do you see other acquisition candidates of similar quality out there?","Christopher J. Klein","Well, we always aspire high. And so I'd say if we could complete others with the profile of WoodCrafters, we'd be delighted. It's a terrific company. It fits very nicely within the Cabinet business. It's a segment of the Cabinet business and Bath Vanity that we were in, but it greatly extends our product line and our reach in that part of the market. So it checks a lot of boxes in terms of criteria, that's why I'd say we'd be delighted if we could check all those boxes every time. I think it really speaks to our discipline. We will look for things that look more like that than not is the way I'd say that. And so might you pay a little bit more for something different? Yes, you might, but it would have to maybe check a couple of different boxes, and add some value in some other ways. So I think it's a good representation of: you buy business, you're cleared going in about where the opportunities are, where the synergies are and you get executing on it right away, and in the end it should flow pretty nicely. So I think those are the types of things that we were looking for and looking at. And as the pace picks up, I think we're going to see a number of things that look like that.","James Barrett - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And your general sense of competition for assets like WoodCrafters?","Christopher J. Klein","I think depending if it's a really tight fit with our business, then we're going to probably have to best look at it. And I think if it's a pretty general asset, then a number of others will take a look as well. So it's hard to say. It depends. I mean, I can -- you can never know who's looking at what, but I can say we're seeing a lot of things and don't really know beyond that.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Gentlemen, can you perhaps describe a little bit how the dealers, I'm talking about a cabinet dealers, how they're describing the shift at the higher margin semi-custom product, which, in the past, you've talked about as actually being kind of a later cycle but a very margin accretive product. I mean, are they seeing more people coming in? Are they setting people to getting home equity loans? Could you give us a little sense there, because some higher-ticket discretionary items like cabinets had big -- not cabinets but appliances had a very big inflection in the second quarter? I just want to get a better sense of how that you guys might be picking that up in terms of backlog before it shows up?","Christopher J. Klein","No. I think we started to see in here over a lot of shopping, really, I'd say in the 6-month leading up to the quarter. So if you go back last fall, there was a lot of talk over a lot of shopping, a lot of proposals being put together and so you could kind of feel that there were consumers out there in the marketplace. I think we're starting to see some of that convert into orders. And again, I'd go back and say it's kind of heart of the market, the semi-custom, so it's not really the high end yet but it's not value. So it's kind of the middle of the market and it's the heart of the market. And so that feels pretty healthy because it isn't -- that doesn't suggest that there's -- it requires a lot of borrowing, a lot of leverage and you may need to borrow something or you maybe have to put on it credit card, but once you get into the kind of the -- if you look back to 2005, 2006, it's a very high end of the market. There, you saw a lot of leverage and people doing some extraordinary things. So I think you're still a reasonable mix come through, I'm just highlighting that it's kind of the middle of the market, as opposed to the lower value end of the market. So that's encouraging. I think the dealers are encouraged by that. The dealers are also benefiting from new construction business that's flowing through their dealerships as well.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. WoodCrafters, and there are some other private cabinet companies out there that have very different margin profiles right now than the larger public companies. Do you think there are -- this goes to the earlier question in terms of pipeline and, perhaps, the characteristics, but are there -- do some of this private family companies that have products in similar categories as the public guys are actually performing better? Is that the -- what we could kind of expect, I guess, from what you're going to be targeting. I know you guys don't want to buy a fixer-upper, but I mean, are there quite a few companies that are outside the public equity domain that you are looking at and vetting? And what might be market cap sizes that might limit you or regional components?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I wouldn't characterize it as -- we're looking at many, many companies right now. I think that there are opportunities out there and it could be across Cabinets, it could be across our Plumbing segment, it could be across Window & Door, it could be Securities. So I think it's a sampling of those, but I don't think it's that heated, as your question might suggest that it's a heated market and that there's a number of those folks who are coming. I think that they could be down the road. I think we'd look for quality businesses. From a major geographic standpoint, it could be in parts of the country, maybe, that we're not as strong. So we've got a strong national footprint, but there may be places that we'd like to add more than others so that would certainly play into it. And I think we'd look at a product line and say it has to be healthy. You're right, I don't really want to be fixing up or trying to drive this margin improvement because there's something fundamentally wrong with whatever business that we're looking at.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then I guess to find that perhaps a weak spot in the [indiscernible] quarter. China, with the slowing GDP, financing, whether it's formal or informal out there in terms of new construction. I know you guys have obviously had good growth rates, and you just kind of -- I think you said it, but if you could just restate it between the U.S. and China, what the growth rates were? But could you just give us what would be a bad scenario? I mean, if China were to have had a very hard landing. I know these flats, apartments, aren't done, finished so you'd still have some lag there. But I mean, if there was really some type of big deceleration, I mean, how will that flow through your production channel in terms of the falling volume versus the improving U.S. market?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. China is going great for us, so I wouldn't characterize it as any sort of a dark spot on the quarter. It actually was quite strong. The thing about the China market is a lot of the housing is built and it doesn't have plumbing installed. So the fixtures aren't installed, so showers, faucets, sinks are not -- they're roughed in, but the consumer has to actually, once they acquire the unit, then go into household shopping malls and select what they want installed. And so it's after they acquire the property. There are also a lot of properties that were acquired that haven't been lived in that once they're sold, somebody is actually going to move in, is a source of demand for us. So we, in many respects, would lag the general construction market. General construction market continues to move along. And we all read about the parts of the market that are overinflated, but still building a lot of units throughout the country. We're still seeing strong flow, same-store sales, as well as the new units that we open up. So China, at least in our category, continues to be strong. There's also some emerging R&R, where you've got consumers maybe moved into unit 7, 10 years ago and putting more commodity-like, lower-end faucets, showers are now coming back and retrofitting and putting in a premium brand like Moen in the market where they're the #3 faucet in the market and very much perceived as more of a premium faucet. So well, the newspaper reports certainly would show China having a lot of issues. I think our business is quite healthy there, and we're quite pleased with the progress that we're making in that market.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Keith Hughes of SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Question on Windows & Doors segment. You have highlighted the difference between the 2 products in terms of growth in the quarter. Can you make some comments on profitability in the quarter between those 2, as well?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. Obviously, when you have 15% growth in the Door business and you have premium product, your margins are very good and your mix is very good. With -- so it's better profitability there. But Windows actually had a fine quarter. We grew from $4 million of overall profit in the segment to $10 million, so we more than doubled, so windows did fine. And having 6% growth there -- and remember that the window business is more R&R driven.","Christopher J. Klein","Our Window business is predominantly R&R, a big-ticket R&R, so we looked at 6% as being an encouraging sign in a category that has been a little bit kind of still asleep that we're trying to get to wake up. And it woke up a little bit in the second quarter, so we're happy with that.","E. Lee Wyatt","So profits -- both pieces of both businesses, profits were improving. Obviously, Doors is a little bit better with the 15% sales growth.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And pricing, specifically in Windows, is -- have you seen any movements in a positive direction there, given the R&R improvement?","Christopher J. Klein","Not so much. There was a little bit of pricing that came through to recover some commodity cost early back half of last year, going into first half of this year. But I would say given that it's kind of slowly growing, it isn't yet where a point where there's a lot pricing in that market. So it may come down the line.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Peter Lisnic of Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On Plumbing, the multifamily initiatives, you talked about some opportunities there. Can you give us a sense as to where that business is, and the opportunities there and how you're kind of focusing on that piece of Plumbing at this point?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, it actually -- and go back 4 or 5 years and we really invested in that sales team on the multifamily side and they have had a steady cadence of -- and spoke new construction but also in multifamily, there's a lot of churn in that channel. As you get a lot of tenants coming in and out and occupancy rates are pretty high these days, and so there is a lot of movement. A lot of times, you are churning faucets out of those units as well. So it's a combination of new construction, as well as the churn that we see in that category. So I'd say it's really the benefit of the last 4 or 5 years investment in there and in that sales team and that focus. And then we also have a product line, CFG, which is really dedicated to that, so we've got kind of the right product at an attractive price point going to the channel with some investment we made on the sales team. So with some volume coming through, that helped us in the quarter.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","But is it safe to say that there is still a pretty substantial opportunity to penetrate that specific piece of the marketplace as you look forward?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I think, our penetration there relative to single family isn't as high, so we can continue that momentum. I think we've made, obviously, great strides over many years on the single-family side. And so we're performing well in multifamily, but I do think there is more headroom there, yes.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Any chance you can give us an order of magnitude as to the quality or depth of opportunity there?","Christopher J. Klein","No, not really. Sort of [indiscernible] a little bit.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","No, I got to try, right? And then just to go back to the China question. If my memory is correct, your store comp there I think has about doubled over the past year, maybe 18 months or so. How do we think about that store count number and the investment associated with it when we look to China over the next 1 to 3 years, assuming that things continue to kind of roll on there from a macroeconomic standpoint?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. It's probably doubled over the last 4 years, more like 3 or 4 years, but it has been a steady clip. And we're adding, we're continuing to add -- I think you'll reach a plateau point here, and I don't want -- I'm not really to call it because it will be very much dependent upon the market, and really the expansion of the market. We're well penetrated in the Tier 1 cities, and we continue to look at that footprint. But it's really the expansion of the 2 Tier -- Tier 2, Tier 3 cities. It continues to expand and they're building more. In those markets that we're in, you could add multiple locations in those markets. And once you're pretty well serving the geographies, then it's just a harder focus on same-store sales and increasing the velocity in those locations. So we watch it. We really do review it a couple of times a year to make sure that we're at about the right pace. I wouldn't say the investment is extraordinary per location. But if we stop expanding locations in a meaningful way, you would definitely see the profitability increasing.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, all right. And just to clarify, did I hear that number right? Around 900 stores; is that correct?","Christopher J. Klein","We're over 800 right now. We're trending toward -- we could be near that number, 900, toward the end of the year or early part of next year.","Operator","We have one more question. Your last question is from the line of Stephen East of ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, I know we sort of beat the incremental op margin quite a bit, but I have just one more question along those lines. With semi-custom coming back a bit faster than you thought, I'm interested to see: One, how much benefit does Plumbing typically get from that? And does this faster pace mean -- has it changed your thought process on what's a sustainable incremental op margin?","Christopher J. Klein","I think it says our perspective on what's a standalone incremental op margin is, I think if you're asking does a stronger kind of heart of the market R&R Cabinet market translate over into better mix on the faucet side? Yes, it probably does. As to the extent folks are starting to do bigger projects, you're going to see a better mix and greater volume on the faucet side as well. So yes, kind of those 2 things are correlated over time. Lee, I don't know if there is anything else on the margins side that you want to add?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, it's always been -- in the first 2 quarters of the year are pretty consistent. They were 29% operating margin in the first quarter, and there were 30% this quarter. So at the higher end, as we've said, but pretty steady for them.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at your free cash flow, you've got strong free cash flow generation. If you sit here and run, say, for the next year or so without finding meaningful acquisitions, do you continue to sit on the cash? How would you likely deploy it if that were the case?","E. Lee Wyatt","Our goal is to drive shareholder value, and we will evaluate the environment we're in, whether it's M&A or increasing a dividend or buying back shares. By year-end, I think we've said that we'll probably -- our net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of this year would be less than 0.5x. So we will have a lot of cash. We will do whatever we can do to drive shareholder value. But we'll be patient and thoughtful and very analytic on how we approach it.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, and I think we've talked before that we're not going to stockpile cash. We've got a very lean operating structure and we don't have a lot of leverage on the balance sheet, so we can be very efficient. And if acquisitions aren't materializing, then we'll be efficient in the other ways that we highlighted. But we don't intend to build a war chest. We're all about just creating as much shareholder value as we can.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to the presenters.","Brian Lantz","Thank you, this is Brian.

Following our prepared remarks, we have allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are off to a great start to 2013. We delivered solid first quarter performance driven by both strong sales and profit growth, and we're increasing our annual outlook.","As volume is returning to the market, the competitive advantages that we have built over time are now generating meaningful results. Our strong results reflect our disciplined focus on profitable growth and our aggressive moves over the last several years to grow share, introduce new products and restructure our operating platforms, all of which position us to leverage the recovering market. We also believe we are now in a position to drive incremental shareholder value.","Let me first spend some time on the first quarter highlights, and then I'll discuss our revised annual outlook, our dividend and our strategic acquisition. For the quarter, sales were up 11%, and EPS was $0.24, up from $0.08 a year ago. Cabinet sales grew 11% as we gained share in all channels and benefited from new construction. Importantly, our focus on profitable growth allowed us to grow cabinet profits by $19 million in the quarter. Moen continued its strong performance with sales growth of 26%, with share gains across the business and profit growth of 52%.","Windows & Doors sales were up 10%, and as expected, the segment operating profit improved. Security & Storage sales were down 14% as planned due primarily to lower sales of tool storage products while profit for the overall segment was up 4%.","Now let me give you some top line highlights by segment. Sales for our cabinet business was up 11% for the quarter and exceeded our expectations. We continued to perform well as the market leader in cabinets with strong results across all channels within the business. The pace of new construction continued to be a key driver as we again saw strength with dealers and builders in our new construction lines. We're also starting to see more growth in our semi-custom lines as R&R spending improved over last year, while the high end of the market remains challenged.","In the dealer channel, where we're the clear market leader. We're leveraging our portfolio of brands and our strong product and service reputation. We also achieved solid growth in home centers where we focus on sustainable long-term growth opportunities and where we saw particular strength in our in-stock cabinet programs and our expanded bath vanity programs.","Notably, we grew our cabinet profits by $19 million in the quarter. This performance again reflects our ability to successfully target growth in channels, markets and product segments that aren't as promotionally driven, while leveraging our efficient operating platform to improve profitability.","Plumbing sales were up 26% in the first quarter. Moen saw broad sales gains in the U.S. and in our international businesses, particularly China. Gains were strongest in the U.S. in our wholesale business where we achieved volume increases driven largely by the pace of new construction. Our leading market share with top builders and wholesalers, expansion into the multifamily segment and upgraded showroom displays is yielding strong sales and improved mix and solid profits.","Moen is also seeing strength at retail, with our steady pace of consumer-driven innovations like MotionSense, a unique hands-free electronic kitchen faucet. Our Microban antimicrobial finishes and new styles like our Ashville, Banbury, Boardwalk and Wetherly bath lines.","Internationally, sales in China, where there are now approximately 800 Moen-branded stores, were again up strong double digits over the prior year driven by new construction and our continued retail expansion.","The team in China continues to build our business with a wider range of price points and with products uniquely tailored to the Chinese market, and the Chinese consumer continues to spend in our category.","Window & Door sales were up 10% for the quarter. Four products saw double-digit sales gains, driven by -- heavily by gains in new construction, partially offset by the exit of less profitable retail programs. Window sales increased more modestly as softness continued in the Repair & Remodel side of the window market, and cool weather in many parts of the country negatively impacted exterior projects.","Importantly, for our 3 housing-related segments, we saw total sales increase 16% for the quarter, well ahead of the overall market for our products, as we continue to gain share in our categories.","In the Security & Storage segment, our sales were down 14% in the quarter and profit increased 4%. Sales declined primarily due to the expected challenging comparison for our tool storage products, as our largest customer did not repeat a unique post-holiday promotion in the category as they did in the first quarter of 2012.","However, we have a number of exciting product initiatives rolling out over the balance of the year and expect full year store sales to be at least even with 2012. Security sales were down slightly to the prior-year quarter. Strength in global safety was offset by softness in Europe.","Master Lock innovation continues to hit the mark in both retail and commercial with new updated versions of well-established product lines and exciting new line extensions. We also began to roll out our new line of commercial electronic access control solutions designed to secure high-value sites such as cellular telephone towers and other storage facilities.","So to sum up the first quarter, I'm excited about our performance versus a market which continues to be led by significantly stronger new construction and a Repair & Remodel market that looks like it's showing some signs of improved growth. This performance demonstrates the strength of our operating model and our ability to generate profitable growth as volume returns and we continue to gain share.","Now let me return -- now let me turn to our revised outlook for 2013. We will then take you through our outlook in more detail in a few moments. From a market perspective, we now see an overall market for our U.S. home products that could be better than our initial assumptions for 2013. New construction remains strong as demand for new homes continues to outstrip supply in many markets across the country.","And notably, the pace of Repair & Remodel growth has picked up somewhat even though spending on larger ticket items like cabinets and windows continues to lag, especially at the high end of that market. Importantly, given our businesses are predominately driven by Repair & Remodel activities, small changes in the pace of R&R, up or down, can meaningfully impact our outlook and results. Therefore, our revised 2013 outlook is built on an assumption that the U.S. home products market grows at a combined  8% to 10% rate with new construction growing in the mid-20s and Repair & Remodel growing 4% to 5%, with some lag for purchases of higher-end big-ticket items.","Based on that market assumption and our ability to consistently outperform, we expect our 2013 full year sales to increase 9% to 11% rate over 2012, with our home products businesses growing faster than that rate and our Security & Storage businesses growing slower than that rate. We expect our 2013 EPS before charges and gains to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.33.","Now let me turn to our discussion of how we're beginning to use our strategic initiatives to drive incremental shareholder value. First, this week, our board approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders. This is an important step as it reflects the board's confidence in our performance, long-term cash flow and strategy for using our strong cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value beyond the recovery.","Second, today, we announced that we have signed an agreement to acquire WoodCrafters Home Products, a leading privately owned manufacturer of bathroom vanities and vanity sink tops. WoodCrafters will become a part of our cabinet business, where we have historically been strong in the kitchen and will greatly increase our product offerings in the bathroom. WoodCrafters' strength with vanities provides us with both additional innovative products and an expanded lower cost North American supply chain, including more capacity in Mexico.","Also important, WoodCrafters comes with a strong seasoned management team and an execution-driven culture that will fit perfectly with ours. They will operate as a distinct unit of our Cabinets segment with its current management team, staffing, operations and locations. The unit will report to Dave Randich, President of our Cabinets business. And we are thrilled to warmly welcome the 2,000 WoodCrafters associates to our Fortune Brands Home & Security family. This is a very strategic acquisition that allows us to build on our competitive advantage in cabinets.","With the market in the early stages of a recovery and particularly as the Repair & Remodel market begins to gain momentum, it's a great time to build on our leading position in cabinets and further strengthen our efficient and responsive North American supply chain.","As I mentioned before, we intend to be efficient with our cash by investing in our businesses, pursuing accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","So to sum up, we had another quarter of strong results. We are confident in our ability to continue to outperform our market, which has improved, and we've raised our outlook for 2013. As volume is returning, the competitive advantages that we have built over time are generating meaningful results. We are also now positioned to drive incremental shareholder value and therefore, initiated a dividend and announced an acquisition. Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our strong free cash flow.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our revised 2013 outlook.","E. Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains, which best reflects ongoing business performance.","Let me start with our first quarter results. Sales were $890 million, up 11% from a year ago, with our home product sales growing 16%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $62 million, up $42 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.24 for the first quarter, up $0.16 or triple the same quarter last year.","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $345 million, up $34 million or 11% over the prior-year quarter with growth in all channels. Operating income for the segment was $15 million versus a $4 million loss in the prior year, up $19 million as we benefited from higher sales volume running through our improved supply chain.","Our strategy of disciplined sales growth is working as planned, as we continue to exceed the overall cabinet market growth, while improving profitability. We're seeing a bit more growth in our semi-custom cabinet lines as R&R spending improved over last year. But higher-end products remain challenged.","Plumbing sales for the first quarter were $309 million, up $64 million or 26% versus the prior-year quarter. All channels performed well with U.S. wholesale, U.S. retail and China businesses all experiencing double-digit sales growth. Operating income was $55 million, up 52% even as we made incremental brand investments. And importantly, operating margin was 17.8%, 300 basis points higher than the same quarter last year.","Windows & Doors sales were $124 million, up $11 million or 10% from the prior-year quarter. Within the segment, the door business experienced double-digit growth, while the window business grew low-single digits. The operating loss for this segment was $8 million, around $2.5 million better than last year. And for the full year, we see significant improvement over last year's profit.","First quarter Security & Storage sales were $112 million, down $18 million or 14% versus the prior-year quarter. The sales decline was primarily due to challenging comparisons caused by an incremental prior-year promotion for tool storage products at our largest customer. This promotion drove storage sales gains of more than 40% in the first quarter of last year. Because this decline was expected, the results were in line with internal plans. Security products saw strength in global safety, offset by softness in Europe.","Segment operating income increased 4% to $12 million, which included $3 million of income realized from changes to our benefit structure as we align all of our benefit programs ahead of implementation of the new health care law less other charges and investments in the business to support new product launches.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our March 31 balance sheet ended with cash at $259 million. Debt remained at $326 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 0.2x, and we have nothing drawn on our $650 million revolving credit facility.","Let me now provide our thoughts in further detail on our revised outlook for 2013. As discussed previously, our approach to the 2013 planning and annual outlook begins with a market assumption. Our approach also includes continued share gains in addition to overall market growth.","So turning to our outlook details. For the full year 2013, our planning assumption calls for the market for our U.S. home product to be up 8% to 10% with new construction growing in the mid-20% range, and Repair & Remodel growing 4% to 5% with purchases of higher-end big-ticket items continuing to lag.","Based on this market assumption and continued share gains, we expect our full year 2013 sales to increase 9% to 11% compared to 2012 with our home product segments growing double digit. We should again outperform our market with all segments increasing.","Based on our market and sales growth assumptions, our expectations for EPS are in the range of $1.23 to $1.33. The midpoint of our guidance represents an increase of 44% over 2012 EPS of $0.89. 2013 free cash flow should be over $200 million after CapEx of approximately $100 million.","Let me now comment on recent actions to use cash to drive incremental returns to shareholders. As we previously stated, over an assumed 5-year time horizon that began in 2012 for the housing market to return to a steady state, this strong free cash flow, combined with our flexible balance sheet, could provide over $2 billion of cash to drive incremental shareholder value.","Accordingly, the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share was announced earlier this week. At this dividend level, we're providing shareholders with a reasonable yield, while maintaining a manageable payout ratio of around 30%. The dividend will utilize approximately $50 million of cash in 2013 and $66 million on an annual basis.","Importantly, this rate of cash usage will provide the potential to the increase the dividend in the future and should not materially impact our ability to, either, invest in the business or make strategic acquisitions.","Turning to our agreement to acquire WoodCrafters. WoodCrafters is a leading provider of bathroom vanities and vanity sink tops to the U.S. home market with current year sales of approximately $230 million. The purchase price of $300 million should be equivalent to 7.5x annual EBITDA. However, over the next couple of years, potential synergies resulting from the acquisition could reduce the purchase multiple to closer to 6x EBITDA.","Before future synergies for the year 2014, WoodCrafters could add an incremental $0.11 to $0.13 of EPS to our overall performance. There could also be incremental EPS benefit in 2013, depending on when the acquisition closes.","I'd like to point out that while the transaction is planned to close in 2013, the exact timing of the closing remains uncertain due to regulatory approval. Since the incremental sales and EPS impact to our overall 2013 results cannot yet be fully determined, we have not included any impact from the acquisition in our 2013 guidance at this point.","In summary, our business model is performing well, and we're pleased with our first quarter. You are now seeing the benefits of our structural competitive advantages that should continue as the market recovery generates additional growth.","Importantly, we now see sustainable momentum in both the housing market and our business performance that allows us to begin to create incremental shareholder value, by initiating a quarterly cash dividend and making a strategic acquisition.","I'll now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks for the first quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen East from the ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Chris and Lee, if we look at WoodCrafters, I mean, if I quickly ran through the numbers there, it looked like an EBITDA margin of 17.4%, which is well beyond what's going on right now with you all. What's -- why -- how are they generating the large margin? And how do you get synergy across the platform for you?","Christopher J. Klein","They're in a category that we're in today in bath vanities, and the structure of that category has got pretty good margins in it. They've got a very cost-effective supply chain and that's one of the things that makes it attractive to us. Going forward, the synergies come, in part, from that cost-effective supply chain. Most of the manufacturing is done in Mexico, high-quality manufacturing at a very good cost to us. So that's really what makes this attractive. It also offers us some product capabilities that we can expand off of. So there's really a lot that makes sense. It's an extension of really an existing strategy. And it's really consistent with what we've talked about since we spun off over 1.5 year ago, which is we are going to look for acquisitions that dovetail into strategies that we're already pursuing, and this one accelerates in a category that we're performing well in today. So there's lot to like about it. It's a terrific team that have been running the business today.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then plumbing sales were off the charts today. Could you just talk about what's going on there?","Christopher J. Klein","We've got strong positions across all channels there. So on the wholesale side, we've got very strong position with the top builders. So as you all have seen the builder results, that volume is flowing through that side of our business. We've also got strength in retail. We've rolled out a lot of new product and that's performing well. And then internationally, we've got strength in China. So it was pretty well across the board pretty consistent. It's really a byproduct of a couple of years of work here as we've built share positions and continue to roll out new products. You get a little bit of volume, a little bit of wind in our sales and man, we take off, and that's what you saw.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Chris, just on that last point where you talked about being able to see that margin acceleration. From the first quarter level, where do you see kind of the year ending up? If you see the channels unfolding as you expect new construction at 20% plus, and then mid-single-digit-type home improvement, can you see the same type of leverage as you move through the year that you saw in the first quarter?","Christopher J. Klein","No, I think we're a little bit ahead of where we say we'd be, if you kind of run the numbers out on our guidance on revenue and then look at the EPS guidance. I think that's in part off the first quarter. Some of investments that we make in the business, launching programs, media spend, other things is a little bit lighter in the first quarter and so that kind of evens out over the year. But I think from a kind of overall business momentum standpoint, I'd see us growing through the balance of the year with continued strong momentum.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","My question was just specific to plumbing. Is that what you were referring to?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, yes, we've got programs. We've got additional brand spend coming through the business. So you see quite a bit of -- we'll have good leverage throughout the year, no doubt about it, but maybe a little bit stronger the first quarter because of that spending.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then, Lee, I think you made a comment within the Windows & Doors segment, that for the full year you expected substantial improvement. Can you maybe just talk to that a little bit more and then anything that might be different the rest of the year versus what you saw in the first year from the cost side.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, I think we'll see -- and you saw very strong sales in the door side and that'll continue on with our expectations around new construction. So I think you'll see nice growth there. We wanted to make sure that when we look at the first quarter and you see a loss, that you understand that that's consistent with what we expected. And as we move through the year and you get more volume, especially Windows [ph] & Doors, that you'll do much better than the $4 million to $5 million we made last year in operating profit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Freda Zhuo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Freda Zhuo on for Steve. So my first question is just looking at WoodCrafters, after the acquisition and the dividend, you're at still pretty healthy leverage. So could you sort of give us an update on what the acquisition pipeline could look like throughout the year? And what kind of transaction multiples are you looking for, for future acquisitions?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, so I think things are slowly picking up on the acquisition side. I don't think it is where it will be. I think it, in the case of WoodCrafters, this is really a relationship that we had with a company for a while. And so it maybe wasn't an indicative of a return to an active -- or as active an M&A marketplace. We maintain these kinds of dialogues throughout each of our businesses and so we're looking for places where we can grow that way. I'd say from just an overall marketplace standpoint, there are a few things out there but I don't think it's picking up to the pace that it will get to. And I think it will pick up over the next 12, 24 months, and I think we will have other opportunities. As Lee pointed out -- as you highlighted, we're still pretty kind of still low leverage, so we still have strong cash flows and strong ability to do some things. And so I think we'll be able to take advantage of those opportunities as they come forward.","Freda Zhuo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just turning the attention to Moen and China. What is the market opportunity that you see in that region now that you're at 800 stores? Do you have kind of a terminal kind of size in mind? And is there a margin differential between the plumbing products you sell through Moen in the U.S. and the products you sell in China?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, so China continues to be a good market for us. We're growing on the ground by opening up more retail, which is really working with local wholesale distributors. That market, while the overall growth rate in housing has slowed, is still building about  6.3 million units a year and a lot of those units don't have fixtures in them so they need to fit them out after the fact. So there's a big backlog of demand there. So we look at it and say this is a good long-term growth market. We assess the growth rate in terms of the pace of putting up new stores and expansion really on a quarterly, semiannual basis. And so we put a plan together beginning of the year but then we assess that based on kind of where penetration is going and same-store sales and those sorts of things. And so I don't have a number in mind for where is the kind of the endpoint in terms of number of locations. We really look more at the productivity of the locations and try to make sure that we're growing and that the stores we're putting out there are productive stores. In terms of margin, today, we're investing. So while we don't own the stores, we've put a little bit of capital in as we're opening. And so as we slow the pace of investment, the market will become more profitable. We have distinct products for that market, so we're selling products that are designed for that market at good, better, best price points. And so it's a profitable market. It's as strong as where the U.S. market is today and now it's not. I think over time, it'll get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Desi DiPierro from RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just filling in for Bob. On the -- in the cabinet segment, now that you start to see some pretty solid sales growth, what are you seeing in terms of the promotional activity that started to subside from your competitors?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I think the reality is capacity is getting used up. So the need to be as promotionally driven starts to back away when everybody gets busy and I think that is the real underlying driver. We started probably 16, 18 months ago backing off and really, it was to focus on growing in channels and in places where it wasn't as promotionally driven. And I think as a rest of the market has gotten busy, the competitive environment has kind of followed suit. So I think we're in a good place there. Is it back to where we'd like to see it long term? No, it's still got a little ways to go, but I think it has improved and now we're seeing some good growth across retail, across dealer and across direct to builder. So we're pleased with kind of the pace across all the channels. And so I think it's -- we're in a much better place now than we were even 6 months ago.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just staying on that topic with the strong incrementals about 55% -- incremental operating margin about 55%. Some of that you would characterize maybe as a better pricing or less promotional activity in addition to the operating leverage?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I think it's -- we're getting good productivity out of the plants. And I think our mix is improving as well, so we're seeing average sales price per cabinet improving. And so there's a combination of things going on, promotion backing off a little bit, some new products which carry better prices and then the mix. Both new construction mix, as well as the R&R mix are starting to improve a little bit. It's not back to where it will get to because of the high end of the R&R market is still pretty weak, but kind of bottom to mid is improving and that's encouraging.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheimer from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering -- I heard some -- different things in terms of Repair & Remodel model activity as we sort of moved through the first quarter into the second. I guess wondering if you can talk about that maybe in terms of the cabinet business at all. And then also the way that you talked about, so the higher end is still lagging, and before, you were talking about sort of the cabinets overall lagging now to the high end. What sort of timing -- or as you're looking at it, what do you think about in terms of timing and any metrics that you're seeing there?","Christopher J. Klein","So we're seeing the bottom end of the market, which can be both in stock, as well as the bottom end of semi-custom. There is an improved cadence there, which means folks are doing smaller projects. We're starting to see some pickup in the middle of that kind of semi-custom marketplace, which is encouraging, that may be some turn in existing housing sales. You've got houses that turn over and folks are coming in and renovating their kitchen. The higher-end R&R, which is that really big project where they're ripping down the studs and bringing in some of our higher price point products. That piece is still lagging. I don't think that's surprising. I think you'll start to see sequential improvements in home values. You build confidence, you build more value in the house. Credit becomes more available. I think as that market comes back, it's just going to take a while. So we're seeing progress against it. I think it's actually unfolding much the way what we thought it would.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. In terms of April trends relative to what you're seeing in the first quarter?","Christopher J. Klein","April trends, I'd say are consistent with the guidance we gave for the full year. So -- and I think it's following on the momentum and just -- it would feel like it's going to drive the top line and earnings the way we guided for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess I just want to go back to plumbing for a moment. Obviously, tremendous top line results there, as well as a nice margin expansion. But on the top line, you pointed to improvement across all 3 of your major channels. What does that mean in terms of share gains? I mean, I would assume -- certainly, you're gaining share but if you could kind of maybe give a little bit more granularity, are there sort of big wins that perhaps you've had on the homebuilder side or on the retail side with some of the new programs? Do you feel that's really where you've been really outpacing the market because, obviously, about the delta is -- the difference in your growth versus some of your peers is pretty material?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I would say it wouldn't be surprising to you that it's a combination of a lot of things, kind of given the size of that growth. So if I look at the wholesale and new construction side of the market, yes, I'd say it's steady cadence over the last 3, 4 years. That team working with the bigger builders and positioning ourselves to be able to expand when the market picked up. So it really was kind of one account at a time through that whole period of time, and now we're seeing the volume flow through that. So it feels like it must have happened recently, but it's the cumulative impact of a lot of hard work by a lot of terrific people over a 3- to 4-year period and that's really it. On the wholesale side, you're also seeing a little bit of improvement in mix. So both consumers and builders are trading up a little bit within the line, so they're going from first upgrade, second upgrade. They're adding a little bit more and that's a good sign as well. On the retail side, it typically is a cadence of new products. So it's -- if we keep the line fresh, we're going to keep getting more SKUs in. And then those SKUs are going to move because you got the right product for the consumer's taste and we're getting better at that, getting on-trend products in there. And it's -- and they are, too, getting a little bit of mix improvement so trading up a bit. The other -- we've talked a little bit about China already as well. So you kind of roll all those things together and you say it really is some of the market volume coming through and then our share positions, which have really been gained over the last couple of years, realizing the results.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. I appreciate that. I guess the second question on WoodCrafters, you said that potential synergies could yield the multiple going down to 6x, which implies about another $10 million of incremental EBIT, I guess, with -- is that something that you'd expect to occur within the first year? Or is that something more gradual, if you're kind of utilizing, let's say, some of their distribution or manufacturing, which you mentioned, or other elements because that -- you did at the same time say that you were going to be retaining their management team and a lot of their infrastructure?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, it's a great business. So, we start with a great business. We're in the midst of looking at them and their execution of programs. They've got some programs there rolling out. So as we would step in once the transaction closes, it would really be focused on continuing the business momentum that they've got, so if it's not broke it doesn't need to be fixed. Over time, we see opportunities there. So I'd say it's really kind of beyond year 1 that we'd start to see a lot of those synergies flow through. It'll be a combination of things. It'll be us utilizing that lower cost structure, that capacity for some of our existing business. It'll be some logistics improvements. And then there'll be some revenue opportunities as well. So it's a question of things that we think are going to -- we're going to be able to take advantage of over time. And really, it's a good time for that because there's capacity there, good low-cost capacity that we can continue to expand as the market -- as the home product market expands. So that's the nature of the synergies. And so it's -- we like are starting spot with it and then we think there's more to add over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I wondered if you -- within plumbing, can you just maybe talk to us about how many points of growth actually came from the Chinese business?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, it's very similar to what we've had in the past year, in 2012. We were, on average, growing -- getting 2 to 3 points of growth out of that China market and it's been very consistent in the first quarter. So it's in that 2 to 3 point range.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Good. And then you had talked earlier about the stock versus semi-custom versus custom segments within the cabinet business. Can you perhaps give us a sense of how your market share differs amongst these market segments?","Christopher J. Klein","We haven't broken it up. I guess I'd give you a broad sense, I think, overall, our share is probably in the 18%, 19% range. And I think we'd probably track evenly across kind of the in-stock side and kind of the bottom end of the semi-custom side in the marketplace. And I'd put in that stock category that builder product as well and then we'd probably trend a little bit weaker at the very high end of the marketplace. So that's about as much as we broke it out.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","What's achievable in terms of growth at the high end once the cycle moves further through its recovery?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, it's -- the nice thing is that you get some pretty good margins at the higher end of the market. So I think it's really -- I think you could see some growth there that could outpace, let's say, a normal 5% to 6% growth rate once that high end kicks in because those are bigger projects, higher margins. So you're making more money per box as we talk about it and say you've got the opportunity to grow stronger with stronger margins. But it's -- that's a later in the cycle phenomenon. If I look back over 2001 through 2007, it was really 2005, 2006 that we saw that growing -- that segment of the market growing just proportionate to the overall market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess on the -- just on WoodCrafters to kind of close the loop there. Can you give us a little bit more color there on the vanity market, just kind of where they fit market share, whether there's any sort of customer concentration? Those points would be helpful.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I don't -- we're not breaking out the market share overall. There's -- they're one of the leaders in that category. It's the vanity and the vanity top and they've got a terrific capability in those tops, both from a cost position, as well as from a design product portfolio. So I think they're one of the stronger players in that marketplace. We certainly said before, if we're going to acquire a business, we want to acquire somebody who's a leader in the segment, and these guys fit that definition. So yes, I'd rather not speak to customer concentration or customer base, but safe to say they're a leader and we think we can continue to grow them and into even a bigger position.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. All right. Understand. And then if I could just switch gears back to plumbing in China. Is there a way that maybe you gave us a little bit of color on how much it's adding to the top line growth? I'm just wondering if you can give us a little feel for what the same-store sales number is? If there's any sort of indicator that, that would kind of match that description that would be helpful. But more importantly, just what you're seeing in terms of return on capital for the investments that you're making in that business in China would be helpful.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, it's a positive return on capital. The segment -- that business is profitable. Not quite as profitable as Moen because, as Chris said -- Moen, you asked, because, as Chris said, we're investing in stores. We're growing 200-plus stores a year. So -- but it's a very good investment as we look at the stores that are open more than a year. We see very strong returns. And so as we're moving through that cycle, I mean, they get very profitable and they're very focused. So it's a very good investment with very good, not only top line, but bottom line leverage potential.","Christopher J. Klein","Same-store sales would be better than, I guess, what the published macro GDP numbers are. So if you look at -- there's a lot of interesting figures published, but 7% to 8%, I think, is where they typically are going right now and so I'd say same-store sales are doing at least that good or better. So that's good indicator that we're getting -- to my comment earlier, the consumer in China is spending on our category, which is encouraging, and they're increasingly spending on a better mix as well. So that's another good sign.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","If I heard correctly, I think we talked about cabinet sales being strong across dealers versus retailers versus home builders. Can you point us to any kind of relative performance there?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I'll give you some color, but I can't give you exact numbers. I'll give you some color. The builder's market is strong as you'd expect. So there, I think, that wouldn't surprise you. If you look at -- we called out the overall new construction market, mid-20s, I'd say, and the builder market doing at least as good as that, if not a little bit better. Dealer market is a combination of R&R and we do get some new construction business there. So that would be kind of blended down. And then home center is probably somewhere in the middle of there and that's both in-stock vanities and special order business. So that's about as far as I can go.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then any way to quantify the negative impact from weather on windows?","Christopher J. Klein","No. The only thing we've looked at is regionally, kind of what's been the pace of growth. And so we did much better out west and so kind of look at that and say, all right, there's intrinsic demand for doing some R&R window projects. These are bigger-ticket projects, but at least in places where it was a little bit better weather, the performance was better. We didn't do very well up north and in the Midwest where it was kind of a lousy winter, spring. So that's really the only anecdotal stuff that says it was probably playing some factor into the business performance. So we'll see how it unfolds in the second quarter. I think that will tell us a lot more about kind of the health of the category.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just a couple of quick ones. The door business, can you break that down for us between new and multifamily?","Christopher J. Klein","It's mostly -- or a majority new. There is some multifamily, but that's going to be more of kind of lower-rise multifamily where they're going to use the type of entry doors that we make. So maybe townhouse-type units and that sort of thing versus high rise. So there's a strong single-family component to that, but that business did well in the quarter and it's performing strongly.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Second question, just on the plumbing suppliers, plumbing supply houses. How do their inventories look at this point? My guess is that there's a seasonal pattern there. But is it a more aggressive seasonal pattern than was last year given what we've seen in new construction? And if so, how do you think that influenced your sales in the quarter?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, they really haven't been building inventory up. I think it's a byproduct of our -- our service levels are pretty high. So from order to delivery, we were pretty reliable and we get the stuff in there. So we have not seen inventories building there. I'd say you're right, seasonally, it's always a little bit ahead of demand, but it's nothing in anticipation of a lot stronger need. I think they're actually ordering to where the demand is and their demand is pretty good. So we're getting it in there and it's going out. And so that cadence has been pretty strong and is continuing.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Unknown Analyst","This is actually Judy in for Keith. In your outlook for 2013 for Repair & Remodel spending to be up 4% to 5%, is this based on what you've seen in the cabinets or are you seeing any other areas where you've kind of seen the pattern where you're more encouraged about the Repair & Remodel spending? The best that you can tell, what's -- or is it just people trading up to better pricing and mix?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. I'd say it's improving more broadly than it had been. So I think with plumbing, it had been running at a pretty good clip and so it's going to continue right there. There is some trade up in plumbing. Within cabinets, it's improving and so that's encouraging. It's not back up to where it will be in terms of laying right on top of the overall R&R market, but it is improving. So that's encouraging. We still see some weakness on the window side. So those are probably the best indicators we've got.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Brian Lantz for closing remarks.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Mike.

Following our prepared remarks, we have allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We delivered strong third quarter sales and profit. We continue to leverage our structural competitive advantages and build on our momentum as the market for our products expands in both the new construction and Repair & Remodel markets. Importantly, based on our momentum and strong performance, we are again increasing our 2013 annual outlook. Let me first spend some time on the quarter highlights and then I'll discuss our increased annual outlook.","For the quarter, sales were up 24% and EPS was $0.46, up 59% from a year ago. Notably, sales for each of our segments were up double digits and our 3 housing-related segments saw total sales increased 26% as we continue to gain share in our categories and benefited from the WoodCrafters acquisition.","Now let me give you some highlights by segment. Sales for our Cabinets business were up 36% for the quarter. Importantly, even excluding WoodCrafters sales, Cabinets sales were up 18%, well ahead of the market for our products as we grew market share in this segment. We exceeded our expectations as we benefited from a growing new construction market and a cabinet remodel market that continues to build momentum.","The stronger pace of R&R spending in Cabinets was a continuation of the momentum we saw in the second quarter and mix continued to improve as we saw growth across a full range of semi-custom and custom product lines resulting in a better mix with higher price points. We gained share in both the dealer channel where we are the clear market leader and in home centers where we saw strength in our semi-custom and in-stock Cabinets, as well as our bath vanity programs. We are leveraging our structural competitive advantages, including our portfolio of brands, our leading position in the dealer channel, a continuous stream of innovation and our service-oriented operating platform to generate sustainable momentum.","Also, the WoodCrafters integration is fully underway and right on track. This acquisition further builds on our competitive advantage in Cabinets, particularly as the Repair & Remodel market gains momentum. WoodCrafters also establishes a leadership position for us in vanities and further strengthens our efficient and responsive North American supply chain.","Notably, we grew our Cabinet profits by $24 million in the quarter, nearly tripling last year's third quarter profit. This performance again reflects our ability to successfully target profitable growth and leverage our efficient operating platform.","Plumbing sales were up 22% in the quarter. Moen saw broad sales gains in both wholesale and retail in the U.S. and in China. Gains were again strongest in our U.S. wholesale business driven primarily by the pace of new construction. Our leading market share with the top builders and wholesalers and our strategy over the past several years to expand in the multifamily segment are yielding share gains and solid profit growth.","We also benefited from consumers choosing to upgrade faucet packages for their new homes, as well as sell-through on our new premium products, including our MotionSense hands-free, electronic kitchen faucet, which is now available in our traditional Brantford line, contemporary kitchen pull down styles and the align and stove collections and our Aris [ph] modern suite.","Moen also saw double-digit gains at retail with their steady pace of consumer-driven innovations. At MotionSense, our Microban antimicrobial finishes and new traditional styles in our Ashville collection and more contemporary styles in our Gibson line. Internationally, sales in China, where there are now more than 875 Moen branded stores, were again up strong double digits over the prior year driven by the expansion of our store network, improved performance of the existing Moen stores and the expansion of our direct-to-builder effort. The team in China continues to build our business with a wider range of price points and with products uniquely tailored to the Chinese market and the Chinese consumer continues to spend in our category.","Windows & Doors sales were up 14% for the quarter. Door products saw sales growth of 14% driven by gains in new construction and our ongoing distribution expansion. Windows sales grew 15% as the window Repair & Remodel market began to grow and as we gain share in our dealer West operation.","In the Security & Storage segment, our sales were up 10% to the prior-year quarter with strong profit growth. Security sales were up 7% to the prior-year quarter with strength in U.S. retail and international. Master Lock U.S. retail sales grew with program expansions at large customers in spite of a relatively weak overall back-to-school period for retailers. Our rollout of a new line of commercial electronic access control solutions designed to secure high-value sites such as cellular telephone towers and other storage facilities also contributed to our sales gains. Tool storage sales were up double digits in the quarter as we continue to reposition the product line, but also benefited as the largest customer pulled forward some shipments into the third quarter, ahead of the fourth quarter holiday season.","So to sum up the third quarter performance, I'm excited about our performance versus our market which continues to be led by significantly stronger new construction and an improving Repair & Remodel market. This performance demonstrates the strength of our operating model and our ability to generate profitable growth as volume returns and we leverage our competitive advantages to gain share.","Let me now turn to our full year outlook for 2013. Lee will then take you through our outlook in more detail in a few moments. From a market perspective, while higher home prices and mortgage rates appeared to have slowed order rates, the new construction market is still on track to grow at 20% this year. And looking forward into 2014, most analysts are projecting growth as demand for new construction outstrips supply in many markets across the country.","More importantly, given that Repair & Remodel is nearly 70% of our mix, it is particularly encouraging to see the improved pace of Repair & Remodel activity continuing into the fall remodel season. Notably, we're seeing strength in some areas that had been lagging such as bigger ticket semi-custom and custom cabinets and replacement windows. We're also seeing increased project size and stronger demand for more premium faucets in our Moen wholesale showrooms. These trends give us reason to be optimistic as we close out 2013 and prepare for 2014.","Therefore, our revised full year 2013 outlook is built on a fundamental assumption that the U.S. home products market grows at a combined 9% to 10% annual rate. Based on our market assumption and continued share gains, we now expect our 2013 full year sales to increase at a 15% to 16% rate over 2012 with our home products businesses growing faster. We expect our 2013 EPS before charges and gains to be in the range of $1.47 to $1.49.","So to sum up to sum up, we delivered strong third quarter sales and profit growth that built on our first half momentum. We remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform our market and we have again raised our outlook for 2013. Importantly, our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our strong free cash flow by investing in our businesses, pursuing accretive strategic acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our revised 2013 outlook.","E. Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges\/gains, which best reflects ongoing business performance. Let me start with our third quarter results.","Sales were $1.125 billion, up 24% from a year ago, with our home product sales growing 26%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $122 million, up 67% or $49 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.46 for the quarter, up 59% or $0.17 versus the same quarter last year.","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $449 million, up $119 million or 36% over the prior-year quarter, led by growth in dealers and home centers. Operating income for this segment almost tripled to $37 million, up $24 million as we benefited from higher sales volume running through our improving supply chain. And operating margin was 8.2%, 420 basis points higher than the same quarter last year. Our strategy of disciplined sales growth is working as planned as we continue to exceed the overall Cabinet market growth while improving profitability.","We are seeing broader growth in our semi-custom and custom Cabinet lines, as R&R spending improved over last year. Excluding WoodCrafters, sales grew 18% and operating income increased $19 million to $32 million, more than doubling. Plumbing sales for the third quarter were $338 million, up $60 million or 22% versus the prior-year quarter. All channels, again, performed well, with U.S. wholesale and retail and the China business all experiencing double-digit sales growth.","Operating income was $66 million, up 36%, even as we made incremental brand investments in the U.S. And importantly, operating margin was 19.5%, 210 basis points higher than the same quarter last year. Windows & Doors sales were $181 million, up $23 million or 14% from the prior-year quarter. Within this segment, the Door business experienced 14% sales growth, while the Window business grew 15%. Operating profit for this segment increased to $9 million, $2 million better than last year.","Third quarter Security & Storage sales were $157 million, up 10% to the prior-year quarter. Security sales increased 7% and sales of tool storage products were up 21%. However, approximately $5 million of the $7 million sales growth for storage in the quarter was the result of our largest customer pulling forward some fourth quarter orders, ahead of the holiday promotional period. Segment operating income increased 42% to $30 million driven by a combination of sales gains and changes to our benefit structure as we align all of our benefit programs ahead of implementation of the new health care law.","So to sum up the third quarter performance, we continue to leverage our structural competitive advantages to drive share gains and we're beginning to see better mix driven by the improving R&R market.","During the quarter, we also took steps to better align the systems strategy in our Cabinets segment with its business strategy, focusing on more flexible systems that provide industry-leading content for consumers and superior tools for designers to deliver the best purchase experience in the industry. As a result of this shift in systems strategy, we recognize net charges of $0.09, primarily noncash charges related to abandonment of previously developed software.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our September 30 balance sheet remained solid, and our cash position increased in the quarter to $157 million even as we opportunistically repurchased $30 million of shares in the quarter. Debt decreased to $356 million.","As we previously stated, over an assumed 5-year time horizon beginning in 2012, to the housing market to return to a steady-state, our strong free cash flow combined with our flexible balance sheet, should provide over $2 billion of cash to drive incremental shareholder value. Let me now provide further details on our revised outlook for 2013.","As discussed previously, our approach to the annual outlook begins with a market assumption but also includes continued share gains in addition to the overall market growth. So based on our market assumption and our performance through the third quarter, we now expect our full year 2013 sales to increase 15% to 16% compared to 2012. Our expectation for full year EPS are now in the range of $1.47 to $1.49. The midpoint of our guidance represents an increase of 66% over 2012 EPS of $0.89. It is important to note that within our EPS guidance, we intend to continue to make strategic investments across our businesses in the fourth quarter in order to prepare for significant growth opportunities in 2014 and beyond.","We expect 2013 free cash flow to be approximately $300 million for the full year after CapEx of approximately $90 million and we should end the year with net debt-to-EBITDA around 0. In summary, our business model's performing well and we are pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance. This momentum should position us well for 2014 as we continue to benefit from our structural competitive advantages in the recovering market for our products. Importantly, this sustainable momentum in both the housing market and in our business performance should allow us to create incremental shareholder value by making select acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase.","I will now turn the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks for the third quarter. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Chris, I was just thinking on the first question, can you maybe dig a little bit further on Windows? It seemed -- the acceleration there 2Q to 3Q and knowing that, that business is both Repair & Remodel and then custom new construction. Any more color you can give as far as what's driving that and what you're kind of hearing from customers?","Christopher J. Klein","Thanks, Dennis. It's really more R&R and what we saw was, I guess, finally a bit of momentum coming back on the R&R side of Windows. I'd say that in general. I guess, the big theme here in the third quarter for us is really a strong R&R demand coming back into our businesses, and I think the Windows side saw that. We also picked up a little business out West through our dealer network out there, so that contributed as well. So I'd say we talked before about Windows and that it's lagged. The energy tax credit over a couple of years ago kind of sucked up some demand and eventually we'd see some more demand coming through Windows. And I think we're pleased that we're finally seeing a little bit of demand flow through that business.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So if you exclude the business that you picked up out West, if you were to look at constant customer business, is that still seeing acceleration?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, yes, absolutely. Now it's primarily through short line distribution and it was kind of across the board, across markets, and so that was pretty good. And I say it was a steady building really from June onward. So we only saw a little bit of it in the second quarter but then it kind of continued through the whole third quarter.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then separately, back to the new construction commentary. You mentioned earlier that people like us in the public markets are talking about the order slowdown that some of the publics are seeing. If you just look at some of your leading indicators, are you seeing any signs either from wholesale inventories or orders that you would see more on the front side of that type of slowing?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I think the third quarter across the board was strong, strong in new construction. September was a strong month, so we saw good activity in September. October is only a couple of weeks so it's hard to tell. I would expect eventually we'll see a little bit of that flow through. But the inventory levels are kind of -- they're whirring to POS, so we don't see a lot of accumulation of inventory, but it's been like that really since May, June. So we haven't seen a lot of that impact flow through the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall, RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Desi filling in for Bob. When you look at the -- at your portfolio, you're starting to see improvement in product mix across the businesses as the outlook for the Repair & Remodel spending improves?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, absolutely. I think that is -- I think the thing that moved the needle the most here was product mix within R&R. We started talking last quarter about the fact that you look at Cabinets business, the heart of market semi-custom, not the value end but really more the traditional semi-custom Cabinet business, we were seeing strong momentum and that definitely continued through the third quarter. Our strength in the dealer side of that business was really good. And in the faucet side, we saw a shift in mix up to really more premium product. And I'd say that was in new construction, as well as R&R. So mix was -- there was plenty of volume but mix was quite good. And I think that drove part of the profitability that you see as well.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then from a manufacturing, logistics perspective, how do you think about balancing price increases for your products versus volume growth given the surge in demand that you've experienced here to date?","Christopher J. Klein","I think we're pretty disciplined. We've been focused for a while now on profitable growth. And the reality is, yes, we could probably see even more top line growth, but we won't call it a growth. And so I think if you look at the results, you see a good balance between top line and strong leverage profit coming through that's a little bit unique relative to some of our competitors. And so I think we balanced that appropriately. I'd say it's not so much as getting price but there's quality business out there and the quality business is the business that we're really working hard against.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, you mentioned that in construction you never saw any slowdown. I guess, in our world, there's a lot of concern that the slowdown over the last 5 months and the government shutdown affecting consumer confidence, et cetera, also weighed on the remodel market or would start weighing on it. If I listen to you, it sounds like you all are not seeing any of that. What would you see initially if you started to see a wobble from the consumer in the remodel business?","Christopher J. Klein","I think you'd see a slowdown in showroom traffic, you'd see a slowdown of consumers coming in with ideas on projects. And the reality is that, that is -- that's a multiple month cycle. Meaning if they're going to do a big kitchen remodel, bathroom remodel, replacement project on their windows, they think about months ahead, they start working on it. And so the good news is all that is still flowing. And to the extent you'd see a slowdown, it wouldn't be until I don't think the next real remodel cycle we should be into next year. So right now, folks aren't stopping, the volume continues to flow on the R&R side and we haven't seen that falloff that folks are looking for.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you look at your strong revenue growth and what you're projecting for the fourth quarter, I guess 2 different questions here. One, how do you split apart at least directionally price, mix and volume? And then your fourth quarter, the implied incremental op margin is lower than what we've seen in any other quarters so far. And I guess it doesn't really match up with, at least the way I'm thinking about it, with what you've been talking about with mix moving up. So maybe you can reconcile those 2 things.","E. Lee Wyatt","I think -- This is Lee. When we think of price, historically, price makes up of -- on an annual basis, about 1% of our sales growth and I think that's consistent for this year. And everything else is mix and units and I think both are growing nicely, especially driven by this increased Repair & Remodel market and specifically with big ticket items. So we don't break that out but both are very favorable. And in terms of operating margins, I think if you take kind of the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter, you see some are 8.5% to 9% and that's higher than the first quarter and that's higher than prior year significantly. So fourth quarter is actually always a little bit lower margin quarter for us than the second and third, so we don't see that as being unusual at all.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then one -- just one quick other question. Your dealer in retail, you said both are growing. Which one are you seeing the faster growth in?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I'd say dealer is very strong. We're strong across both and it's quite encouraging to us that we've been so disciplined in terms of the promotional activity on the retail side and home centers and yet we continue to grow share there. And then on the dealer side of the market, we're a leader in that market. We've continued to pick up dealerships. We're going deeper into the dealers, meaning they're carrying multiple lines. And we're just seeing great order patterns. And I think it's a multi-year investment and really the service around that channel. So we're pleased with both. I think they're really unique in terms of behavior, but they've both been very strong to this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Chris or Lee, I wonder if I could just -- the question Steve just asked around volume for Cabinets, I think it was generally for the company, but could you kind of break out the 18% organic, how much of that was volume and then price mix? Because I think there's some widening dispersion we're seeing and -- what was the industry growth rate do you think for Cabinets in the quarter?","Christopher J. Klein","We don't really break that out. I think it was a combination of both for us. There was healthy volume coming through, but we did see a movement upward in mix going from our value lines more into the heart of the market, stronger kind of per box priced semi-custom lines and even a pickup on the custom side of the market. So I think it was a combination of both as you look at it to get to that kind of growth. Then -- and that will then reflect through on the margin side as well, right?","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I think, Lee, when you're making the comments around Cabinet organic, you said that obviously up 18% and then it was a $32 million organic number kind of implies an 8% margin. Which would have -- when you back out kind of looks like the WoodCrafters is kind of in that 8% margin range. Is that -- I thought that was going to be a higher margin business? Or can you talk about the margins implied in that acquisition and how long they'll kind of stay at that lower rate than it had been running historically?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, just to quote the facts. The Cabinet margin was 8.2%. WoodCrafters was actually about the same margin, about 8% in the quarter. In the third quarter we had these accounting adjustments because this is the first quarter that we included them. We have to mark up inventory and so when you look at -- when you think about future quarters, historically, their operating margin is going to be 13% to 15%. So they're very profitable, it's just that they were depressed in the third, which, I think, we talked about last quarter.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Correct. So it'll be flowing through at that higher historical rate now that you've done the inventory adjustments in this first quarter?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. So the good news is all this flushes out in the third quarter. So by the fourth, we're run rate margins.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Excellent. And could you -- now that we're seeing the strong Door and Window growth, can you kind of just talk to the margin spread, I guess, if you will, or how we should think about the profitability there as Doors is obviously more profitable. You guys are doing some OEM work. Windows get more supply in the channel but with this type of volume, how should we think about that kind of run rate?","E. Lee Wyatt","I'd say it's still a case where the Door business is generating much of the segment profit because it's in kind of a steadier cadence, if you will. On the Windows side, we're just now starting to see the growth come through. Over time, that will convert better into profitability. So I think that's the balance between those 2 right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask you a little bit more about Cabinets, that information on WoodCrafters was very useful, but I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you -- what we saw in the quarter with respect to the Chinese plywood issue, and I know that you guys have been doing a pretty good job around that. But I was curious if you could comment on what impact you think that may have had in the third quarter or how that impact may play out for you at all in the fourth quarter or beyond?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. First of all, the issue has really been slow to develop over the last 18 months, so we saw this coming on the horizon all the way until it's about to have some impact. Didn't impact the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we don't think it's going to have any material impact. What we're doing is working with different suppliers to try to mitigate some of that impact, and that's both across China, the rest of Asia, as well as North American suppliers. We've got a lot of scale, obviously, being a leader in the industry on the Cabinets side and in fact the WoodCrafter acquisition helped that as well. So we're doing all we can to try to mitigate it. I think to the extent that there is some pricing that then would need to come in, in addition, we'll be in a strong position to take the pricing that we need but we're not going to need to take all the pricing that perhaps may flow through the overall industry. So the good news is this wasn't a surprise. We've been active in working and talking with suppliers and I think we'll manage through it just fine.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, that's -- yes, that's really encouraging. Also, if I could ask you a question about your overall incremental margin. One of the things that we focused on was, in the recent presentation, I guess, you had changed the disclosure on incremental margins as you get to a steady state. And at that time, I think you were basically implying an incremental margin that could be achieved of roughly 35%. And this quarter, and I know there were some issues but it looks like you are probably sort of in the low- to mid-20s. And I was curious if you could comment on whether you do -- just -- do you look for 35% incremental margin opportunity as you get back to a steady state? And if so, how do you envision that sort of growing from here up until up to that level? Like what do you see the flight path or the trajectory of that incremental margin looking like?","E. Lee Wyatt","Let's -- we'll start with the third quarter. A strict calculation would be about 22% or 23% incremental margins, but WoodCrafters being in here for the first quarter will reduce your incremental margin. If you exclude the WoodCrafters impact, they carry a very good run rate operating margin but it does take down your incremental. So if you exclude WoodCrafters, we were 28% incremental margin for the quarter, which is right in the middle of our 25% to 30% annual growth. So we feel good about that and it kind of fits where we thought. In terms of longer term, we've talked about 25% to 30% as we get back to that 14% operating margin when we hit steady state, which is 1.5 million housing starts and 5% to 6% R&R and we're pacing nicely if you take the midpoint of our guidance on operating margin. This year, it's going to be 9%, 9.5%, so that's all good. But -- so we've really -- just to be clear, we've never said that incrementally we would move to 35% to get back to that steady state. 35% is a calculation and if you get to $800 million of EBITDA right at $5 billion, it might take us $5.1 billion, it may take us $4.9 billion or $5.2 billion. So 25% to 30% is where we see the incremental margins during this period of getting back to that steady state. So we feel very good about our margin in the quarter and we feel very good about where we're moving as we get back to steady state.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, just to go back to the incremental margins for a moment. And appreciate the clarity that, I guess, you're reiterating that in fact it's still the 25% to 30% on a consolidated basis over the next couple of years or as we get back to normal. But the Cabinet margins this year went from 56% incremental in the first to 36% in the second. And I believe if you adjust for WoodCrafters, it's 32%? So just wanted to get a sense for that business overall. I believe you've talked about it in the past as being above average and even this quarter, it would -- that would be the case. But is something more in the low 30s kind of a reasonable way to think about that business going forward?","E. Lee Wyatt","We've just again restate the facts. You're right on a calculation basis, incremental margins for Cabinets were about 20% in the quarter. Back out WoodCrafters, it's about 32% just as you state. As you think about the year, we will be in Cabinets above 30%. And a lot of that has to do as we -- in any given quarter, any given year, we talk about it could spike above the 25% to 30%. And you're seeing now and you're seeing it a lot around R&R as it comes back and you get the big ticket lags starts to stop or disappears. And so we're seeing that and that will cause it to spike a period of time. But over time, 25% to 30% makes sense for the total company and somewhere in that range over time for Cabinets but yes, you could see it spike above 30% and we will see it above 30% this year, we think.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just so I got the math right also on the inventory adjustment on WoodCrafters, that's a $3.6 million or so, that's about an 80 bps hit, that's more one-time, is that fair to say?","E. Lee Wyatt","Fair to say. That's a little high. The inventory -- actual inventory adjustment is closer to about $2 million.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Was that the entire adjustment or were there other adjustments because you said that normally, you would have been 13% to 15% and it was at 8%.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, I think if you look on a run rate, just looking at a business that's $230-plus million, I think you'll see on average a 14% operating margin. There is also amortization of the goodwill associated with it, but I would plan around 14% operating margins in that business.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just one other technical question, if I could. The benefit -- change in benefit plans that affected the Security & Storage segment. Could you just break out what benefit that was exactly? And is this kind of a one-time positive impact or should we be modeling this higher, the benefit -- that the margin benefit from this change is an ongoing phenomenon?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, that we are taking the cost down there on some of the benefit programs. It will be a multiyear benefit, so it will not be just this year. So you'll see it for several years. So you could continue to model that in. We'll build into our overall guidance when we give you guidance for '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can talk about your thoughts on terms of use of cash given the comments about the -- where the balance sheet will be at the end of this year. Certainly a good problem to have. How do you think about that in terms of the upside for acquisitions here? And desire for them and the opportunities that you're seeing available right now?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. We've been consistent in how we've thought about it and remained kind of the same place, which is first priority is to invest in the business, prepare for what we see as a multi-year expansion in both new construction but also R&R, make sure that we're investing in the business appropriately. We then would look out and say, to the extent we see accretive acquisitions that can build the business, we'll give those consideration. If not, we'll be in the market buying back shares or increasing our dividends. So our intention is not to stockpile cash. Obviously, we don't have a lot of debt, but we will over time here utilize the balance sheet efficiently to create the value that we can create. So we'll be looking at the situation as we come into the year. Right now, the M&A market isn't that active, but there are feelings out there. And so over time, we expect that will -- the pace of that will increase over the next 18, 24 months. And to the extent there are things that look like we want to do near term, then we'll be more aggressive in our dividend or share repurchase.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. In terms of the share repurchase, how should we think about that moving forward? Is that something based on sort of opportunistically during the third quarter based on dips in the stock? Or are you planning to put to work similar amounts in terms of dollars on a quarterly basis here? Any thoughts there?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, in the short term, we'll use -- probably share repurchases more just on the opportunistic basis until we understand the broader market for M&A and where to really maximize our use of cash to drive shareholder value. So as we learn more about M&A, we may do more of that. At some point, if -- once we understand the M&A market over the next 6 to 18, 24 months, we may increase share repurchases. But that would just be as a way of maximizing shareholder value when we have more facts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois, Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Just wondering first off if you could talk about the impact on Plumbing margins from the growth in China?","E. Lee Wyatt","The Plumbing, as we've said, we're investing and growing. We have over 875 stores now, so we're growing that. The margins are lower than the Moen business in the States because we continue to invest, so it's lower, but it's still very positive. We like that business. It's a great growth opportunity. And when we stop opening as many stores, then obviously the margins will pop back up. So a little dilutive on margins but still very positive. But it's hard to criticize anybody who doesn't have the margins of our Moen wholesale business, they're so strong.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. I guess, a natural follow-up to that would be when would you anticipate the cadence for the sales growth from new store openings to slow? And in turn, margins to trend up closer? And why with the legacy business?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, it's something we look at quarterly. And this year, we were very disciplined in terms of both opening stores, as well as closing stores that weren't performing up to our standard. And so I'd say we slowed the pace of net expansion in doing that to make sure we're getting the right throughput in each location. But having said that, we did obviously continue to increase. At some point, it will really be determined by the market. And if the market slows down in terms of where the opportunity is or if we feel like we've saturated the markets that we're focused on, then we'll back that off and the natural consequence of that will be higher profit levels but probably not as robust a growth trajectory although we expect to continue to be positive. It's kind of the nature of -- we've built this business from scratch over the last 17 years and kind of came in and built it one at a time. And so I think that's the characteristic of developing an organic market is it has that kind of a pattern. But at some point, we want to turn it into more of a strong profit contributor, as well as a growth contributor.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And just a follow-up on Cabinets and raw material costs. Was there any impact of raws on Cabinets in the third quarter?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. And I'd say generally in terms of inflation across Cabinets and the business, very modest overall inflation in the quarter. We did see in terms of the wood and the plywood and particleboard, we did see some inflation more in that kind of mid-single digits, but very manageable. So very manageable on the Cabinets side all around.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the Cabinet business, as you look at the mix moving to semi-custom and custom a little bit of that needle moving, can you give us a sense to how far off we are from normal in that mix? And then what that might mean as you kind of move more towards on more normal semi-custom and custom mix, what that might mean from a margin perspective?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I'd say in general terms, we're not there yet, and we're probably not even halfway there yet. The market, I would characterize over the last 3, 4 years has been very value-focused. The price points around, I'd say, value semi-custom significantly less than where the market's starting to shape up right now. And consumers are now focused more on quality, durability, getting the right look that they want and that moves them up into the kind of the heart of the market, semi-custom market. So I'd say we're not even halfway there. As it moves forward, yes, you will see improved mix and improved profitability as we come through there. I wouldn't -- I'd just characterize it as being within the movement of the 8% margin we're seeing today up to that 14%. A lot of that improvement is driven by this part of the market. We're primarily an R&R-focused Cabinet company in the dealer network, home center market. And that really is what drives us from that 8% to that 14%.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And just one quick one. The asset impairment charge that you recorded in the quarter, can you just a little bit of detail on what that was?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, it's just part of our normal process of kind of aligning our IT strategies with our business strategies and adjusting business strategies. So we basically looked at the -- it's in Cabinets basically and we said we need more flexible systems, that's what where we're going to invest. We've got some systems developed over the last several years that we don't really -- we won't use because they're not as flexible to really drive the good customer experience that we need. And so we're always going to keep our balance sheets clean. So we took a charge about $0.09, it's all noncash for things developed over several years. So it's just a matter of just continuing positioning ourselves for growth and being the #1 in the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My question has been answered.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Yes. A lot of my questions have been answered, too, but just thinking at a high level, thinking about your leadership in the dealer space in Cabinets, obviously, it's a high-margin, desirable channel, there are a lot of competitors kind of jockeying for that position. I guess, how do you think about -- or what are you seeing competitively? And what kind of moats do you have there in the dealer space?","Christopher J. Klein","The dealer market is a long-term game. And as we sit here today, we've got real structural competitive advantage in that market. We've built that business over many, many years. We've got deep relationships with the individual dealers. We work hard to bring them across multiple lines. We support them. These are literally thousands of customers across the country. There's small business owners. And we've done a lot to help them survive and we've done a lot to help them grow, and there's really great relationships through the whole system. And so, we do that. And then on top of that, bring in new products, great customer service, terrific quality. We're close to market in terms of manufacturing, got semi-custom plants throughout North America, close to the end market. So they've got great service from that. So we think we're really well positioned in that market and our results continue to show that. We're obviously concerned about any competitor who shows up and we'll keep executing and do what we do well every day and I think the results will continue to be positive for us. So yes, I'd agree. You expect others would continue to focus on the market, but I like where we are, and I'd expect we're going to continue to see success.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Yes, I think that makes sense. And the results speak for themselves.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","But -- so just one more question, also kind of high level, but how do you think about the impact of kind of the modestly higher interest rates we've seen for your business? And kind of interplay with new construction activity?","Christopher J. Klein","I guess, I look at it -- obviously, you're going to have short-term shocks to any business. But I'd look at it over the medium term and just say, I like the overall picture of the market. And keeping in mind, we underbuilt on the new construction side for many years. And so the market is kind of building to satisfy that demand, interest rates are still historically very low. And affordability is very good. And so you look at those fundamentals and say, if I look out to '14, if I look out to '15, my expectation is you'll continue to see healthy growth rate in new construction. On the other side of the business, on the R&R side, a lot of the renovation is being driven really by people investing in their homes. Not a lot of borrowing as far as we can see. I think there is some borrowing against it. And as people's equity in their homes improve, they'll have more to draw upon, which will probably be more powerful than a 75-basis point movement in interest rates. So I think the availability of credit is important. And I just look at rates and say, historically, mortgage rates are still pretty good, 4.25, 4.5, relative to historically where they've been. So that's the way we run our business, that's how we plan. We look at the macros, we look at the longer run and play it out over the next year and 3 years. And we see good growth ahead of us. And frankly, we're planning for how we're going to fulfill against all that terrific growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Could you frame for us the growth that you saw in the semi-custom Cabinet markets and whether or not there is any deceleration or acceleration in the stock Cabinets?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. Semi-custom was strong and kind of consistent throughout the quarter and remains strong on the stock side, there's a couple of categories here. There's stock cabinets that go into new construction on our Aristokraft line. And then there's in-stock cabinets that we sell into home centers. I'm not sure which one of those you're questioning.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Yes, I guess, first is more curious because you saw that kind of mid- to high-teens growth, the segments are organically in the semi-custom side.","E. Lee Wyatt","I'd say just from the data, we saw strong double-digits across the board in all those categories and did not see deceleration. We had seen early growth in the year in the stock. And now we're just in this quarter seeing really the strong growth in the semi-custom and custom. So they were all strong double-digit growth.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And the faucet shift to the premium products, would you characterize that as being market-driven or was it specific to product launches or shelf space that you gained?","Christopher J. Klein","It's both. I think it's both new products we brought out that are selling through strongly. And then I also think that if you're looking at a better mix, both on the R&R side, bigger projects, more and we saw that on the Cabinets side, too. That translates into a more premium faucet package, more premium bathroom, showering. So I think it's both of those things flowing through. And we're fortunate to have continued to invest in new products and new innovations. So when a consumer shows up in our showroom, our stuff looks great and when they want to move up into a higher price point, we can meet that need because we've got new finishes, new features, styling that appeals to their demand. So I'd say those 2 things are working hand-in-hand and we're capturing that benefit.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Jim Barrett from CL King.","James Barrett - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Chris, could you discuss the level of promotional activity year-over-year in the quarter among the home centers, in dealers? And what is your outlook for '14 in that regard?","Christopher J. Klein","I'd say we're very pleased that, that level of promotional activity has come down. I think it's down to a level that -- well, I don't think it's as low as it might have been in 2006, it's come significantly down to a point where it's sustainable where it's at. I don't think it's going to increase going into next year. Frankly, I think there's enough fundamental consumer demand that folks don't need to be doing it. There's also pretty good capacity utilization through the industry. So if those were the drivers over the past couple of years, those drivers aren't there anymore. So I'd say it's a pretty good environment just in terms of the level of promotion and the overall level of pricing in the market.","James Barrett - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And did I hear you correctly that the rate of sales growth in Cabinets was higher among dealers and home centers than among homebuilders?","Christopher J. Klein","I think what we were saying was it ticked up. So they're now at about an equal level but accelerated as R&R picked up really over the last 4 months. The homebuilders were on a separate track, obviously, throughout the first half of the year of strong growth. R&R was lagging there, especially big ticket was lagging. But over the last 3 or 4 months, we've seen that pick up and -- so now they're running at about the same level.","Operator","And I will now turn the call back to Brian Lantz.","Brian Lantz","We'd like to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you very soon.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Fink","Thank you, Brian and thanks to everyone for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, our teams continued to execute against our growth strategies. We delivered solid results as sales grew 4% and we continued to improve overall operating margin. I am particularly proud of our team's performance during the year. In 2019, we experienced a housing market that grew slower than planned as well as a variety of other external pressures most significantly higher tariffs. We overcame these challenges and delivered solid performance showing that we can execute well in a challenging environment.","As we enter 2020, with the backdrop of a strengthening housing market and a more stable trade and tariff environment, I'm excited about our prospects as we continue to outperform the market and make the long-term investments to position our portfolio to continued growth and improving margins.","Each of our segments is well positioned to grow in 2020 and we continue to allocate resources and capital to capture our highest return opportunities. Coordinated efforts across our supply chain, legal and pricing teams continue to work to optimize performance and mitigate the effects of tariffs. We will continue to focus on our cost structure through supply chain, manufacturing footprint optimization and other initiatives like indirect spending to better improve margins and our financial performance in 2020 and beyond.","I'm also extremely proud to note that our strict emphasis on safety resulted in record low recordable incidents and continued low loss time rates investing in the safety and wellness of our people, so that they can return home in the same or better shape than they arrived is a top priority. It is engraved in our values, our culture and our strategy.","We are honored by the recognition and accolades that we have received for our environmental, social and governance efforts this past year. In 2020, we're going to further advance our ESG initiatives. While we are proud of our progress so far, we are committed to continually raising the ESG bar. Our latest ESG report is available on our website.","During my remarks today, first, I will discuss our view of the U.S. home products market. Second, I will provide my thoughts on our fourth quarter and full year performance. And lastly, I will speak to it live in the year ahead. Then, I will turn the call to Pat and he will speak to our financial performance as well as our 2020 outlook.","Starting with our updated view of the U.S. home products market. As we mentioned last quarter, the home products market began to pick up in September and October. That activity continued into November and December and the environment remains encouraging into this early portion of 2020.","For the fourth quarter, we estimate that the global market for our products grew roughly 4% with U.S. new construction returning to high single-digit growth. Key indicators are pointing to a strengthening backdrop for this year and we continue to have a healthy consumer environment, low unemployment, and low interest rates trends that we expect to continue throughout 2020.","Builder sentiment and orders are strong, and we are ready to execute as builder activity translates from orders to starts and into our order books as our products go into homes towards the end of the construction project.","Repair and remodel activity remains stable, while we maybe seeing signs of an improvement in R&R, we are assuming only a modest acceleration in our 2020 plan. We will have a better feel for 2020 R&R by late winter or early spring. While Pat will provide specific details in his comments, we are expecting the 2020 market to be at least 200 basis points higher than the 2% to 3% market that we experienced during full year 2019.","With expected housing market improvement and solid momentum in our key growth areas between plumbing, value-priced cabinets and outdoor living, we are confident that our 2020 efforts will produce market-leading sales growth and solid margin expansion.","Now turning to our performance during the most recent quarter. Our solid results in the fourth quarter were driven by strong execution from our teams across our businesses, producing sales growth and margin performance in each segment. In the quarter, total company sales increased 4% and operating margin was up 140 basis points to 14.1%. Our performance in the quarter was also helped by rigorous expense controls across the businesses, while we continue to make prioritized investments in key areas to support our growth opportunities.","Turning to our businesses, starting with Plumbing. In the fourth quarter, the Global Fund Group continued to outperform the global market with sales growth of 12% an operating margin of 21.7%. Annual operating margin was 21.5% and this marks the fourth consecutive year of market-leading growth at 21% plus margins for GPG, a clear sign that our strategy is working.","Our Plumbing business is firing on all cylinders and was driven by above-market growth in both, China and the U.S. We continue to expand our product offering with partnerships and adjacencies, which is resulting in accelerated share gains. Moen brand health continues to strengthen across all metrics in total and across targeted demographics, consistent with our strategy to reenergize our core Plumbing business.","The growth in brand awareness, purchase intent and loyalty throughout 2019 was especially good in our targeted entry-level demographic, which are millennial-aged adults. They are the largest segment of the population and will drive household formations in new construction for years to come. We continue to be the preferred choice for builders and have gained share during the recent quarter and throughout this year, adding to our powerful installed base.","In 2020, for the fifth year in a row, Moen was named America's most trusted faucet brand by Life Story Research. As I mentioned, we continue to reenergize the core of the flagship Moen brand through brand building and consumer-relevant innovation. Our U by Moen is a great example of this. We recently extended our successful digital water platform with the addition of a voice-activated kitchen faucet, which received a great deal of acclaim at CES and won the Kitchen & Bath Best of 2020 in the smart home category this month.","Along with our Flo by Moen smart leak detection system in 2019 this marks two years in a row, we have won best of in the smart home technology category at the influential KBIS show. Through strategic partnerships, we are creating additional growth engines and increasing the opportunities to leverage our powerful brand and move to market assets. Recent examples in partnership wins for the brand include, the Nebia by Moen smart shower system and advanced shower system that delivers a spa-like experience while using up to 45% less water than the standard shower. And the Moen with INLY aromatherapy shower which uses proprietary aromatherapy pods to enhance the showering experience.","Both were unveiled this month after 2020 Kitchen and Bath Show in Las Vegas. These products are part of innovative partnerships that help drive Moen as a leader in consumer-driven thoughtful water solutions. Our strategy is fueling share gains improving brand health and is creating adjacent product opportunities across our route to market.","Our Moen China business continues to grow profitably at a double-digit growth rate. Our focus has been to target the largest Tier one and Tier two metro markets and to expand to our presence with adjacent product categories. All channels are working for us and we continue to take share. We're closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak. We do not anticipate a material impact on our business at this time.","Finally, we are improving our showroom footprint for both Moen and the House of Rohl with enhanced displays and a broader suite of untrended product offerings. Overall, we expect GPG to continue to outperform the global market with category-leading margins through best-in-class brand building and exciting consumer and product driven innovation that will further differentiate us as an industry leader in addition to reenergized core with multiple growth engines including digital water, China, M&A and strategic partnerships.","Moving on to our Doors & Security division. In the quarter, Doors & Security sales increased 8% and operating margin improved significantly to 14.9% as our Doors & Security business returned to its previous strong operating performance levels.","Operating performance in Doors was solid while managing through a retail inventory rebalancing. We believe that inventory rebalancing indoors has concluded and had strong retail POS and recent new construction strength should provide tailwinds as we enter 2020.","In Security, we saw improved operational performance and margin expansion as last year's platform transition is behind us and pricing is now in place to address inflation and tariffs. We saw a strong growth in decking throughout the season including further acceleration as we began to roll out new Fiberon distribution. Capacity expansions and investment in our bicoastal facilities are underway to support planned growth over the next three years.","And finally turning to Cabinets. For Cabinets, fourth quarter sales were roughly flat versus a year ago excluding the comparison to a 53rd week in 2018. Operating margin was 10.1%. We continue to see store sales growth in value-priced products which were offset by lower sales and higher-priced products during the quarter.","In fact, our in-stock value price orders were up 18% in the month of December. Additionally new construction orders are accelerating growth in our builder channel as well. Under new Cabinet's President, David Banyard cost out and capacity rebalancing initiatives are accelerating for semi-custom and custom products. Initially we're ramping up our value price capacity and leveraging our Mexico and other low-cost country supply chain to meet demand as exceeding our initial expectations.","Anti-dumping duties and 301 tariffs are meaningfully reducing Chinese imports. We're continuing to add capacity and extend the further rollout of our Mantra EVE and Urbana lines across our 4,500 kitchen and bath dealers as well as leverage our strong Aristokraft brand, all of which are targeted at the heart of this opportunity.","Our Mantra line, which we have already rolled out in the Northeast, is having tremendous success selling demand from value price point products in our key dealer channel. We are aggressively moving to add capacity to expand this line in other markets.","We're also seeing high interest through our retail and home center channel given our innovative lines of new products and ability to serve the channel with consistency and quality. I expect us to capture share throughout this year and beyond and increasing margin levels.","To sum up the quarter as a whole, we continue to outperform a more modestly growing market and offset tariffs by expanding and growing categories and channels, launching innovation and integrating key partnerships, transforming our supply chain taking price and staying in front of the ever changing landscape. I am proud of our team's ability to deliver in this environment. Our performance in the quarter and in 2019 as a whole speaks to our team's ability to manage the business tightly during slower periods and to capture share and position us to generate even higher growth during accelerated cycles.","Now looking ahead to 2020. We enter 2020, encouraged by the strengthening marketplace, as well as consumer and builder confidence. There is significant demand for U.S. housing and the rate of growth will be dependent on the availability of supply factors such as labor. We have built a plan to outperform on a reasonable set of assumptions and see upside should the market be even better.","Against that backdrop, we have multiple avenues of growth and our teams are focused on capturing the most profitable of these opportunities. By focusing on turn of growth opportunities and cost optimization we will continue to achieve share gains and margin expansion accelerating value creation for investors.","Our 2020 plan assumes a more stable trading tariff environment and we expect to offset all tariff expense by proactive supply chain actions and if necessary price. In 2020, I've challenged our associates to pursue the next phase of growth with increased focus to drive further value for our shareholders.","As Pat will describe in more detail, we have a 2020 plan in place that reflects U.S. market growth improving on the back of new construction, market beating performance in the U.S. and abroad, especially in China. Potential upside to our plan would also occur if the market improves more than we expect and\/or we achieved greater-than-expected gains in Cabinets, if the antidumping countervailing duty situation plays out.","We expect to drive margin expansion by Cabinets and Doors & Security improvement initiatives while maintaining industry-leading margins in Plumbing. We also expect to deliver mid single-digit sales growth and high single to double-digit EPS growth. Our objectives for 2020 remain to deliver market-leading sales growth and margin improvement approaching 50 basis points.","I will now turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Hallinan","Thanks, Nick. As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance.","Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.47 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $207 million, up 15% or $26 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 14.1%, up 140 basis points over the same quarter last year.","EPS were $1 for the quarter, up 16% versus $0.86 for the same quarter last year. We remain pleased by our team's continued ability to grow sales and earnings during a period of softer market growth, the persistence of a challenging trade environment and while navigating significant supply chain transitions in a number of our businesses.","Now let me provide more color on our segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the fourth quarter were $548 million, up $60 million or 12%. Continued strong double-digit growth driven by results in China and the U.S., which powered through the continued market weakness in Canada and Mexico.","Plumbing operating income increased 9% to $119 million for the current quarter. Operating income for the full year was $436 million, an increase of 10% over 2018. Operating margin for the quarter was 21.7%, an excellent result driven by cost discipline and sales growth leverage. For the full year Plumbing operating margins came in at 21.5%.","Full year 2019 sales crossed $2 billion for the first time up 8% versus 2018 up 9% adjusting for FX. We concluded our fourth straight year of strong growth and over 21% margins. Our strategies are clearly working and we expect another strong year for Plumbing in 2020.","Doors & Security sales for the fourth quarter were $331 million up $24 million or 8% driven by Fiberon and operational improvement in our Security business. Door sales were flat, as retail inventory rebalancing continued through the fourth quarter. We believe this retail inventory rebalancing is complete and we expect solid sales growth in 2020 as retail POS remains solid and new construction is strengthening.","Decking sales were up double digits in the quarter in part aided by new distribution load-ins. Security sales were up in the quarter due to strength in retail locks and commercial products and favorable comps to last year's service issues.","Operating income was $50 million during the quarter up 85% over the same quarter last year driven by operating improvement in Doors & Security and by 2018 security costs. Operating income for the full year was $177 million, an increase of 14% versus 2018.","Segment operating margin for Doors & Security increased 620 basis points for the quarter over last year to 14.9% and was 13.2% for the full year up slightly versus 2018 as the segment invested in Fiberon. For full year 2019 sales were $1.4 billion, an increase of 14% over the prior year.","Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the fourth quarter were $591 million, which was roughly flat if adjusted for the 53rd week in 2018. We continued to experience strong growth of value-priced products while sales of higher-priced products contracted during the quarter.","Operating income for the fourth quarter was $60 million down $2 million versus the prior year. And for the full year was $231 million roughly flat to a year ago. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.1% and 9.7% for the full year both up 10 basis points versus the respective 2018 period.","This miss of our full year operating margin target of 10% was due to temporary inefficiencies experienced during the fourth quarter which resulted from expanding and optimizing our Mexican manufacturing footprint. This has been rectified and early first quarter production rates and efficiency are already at the levels we had expected to achieve during the fourth quarter.","We expect Cabinets' operating margin improvement in 2020 as Cabinets' President, Dave Banyard accelerates our efforts to cut costs and right-sized capacity in higher-priced product segment, while aggressively growing our value price point business in an efficient manner. Full year 2019 sales were $2.4 billion down 1% or roughly flat adjusted for the 53rd week in 2018.","For the total company to sum up our full year consolidated 2019 performance. Sales increased 5% to nearly $5.8 billion, 6% adjusting for FX. EPS grew 8% to $3.60, demonstrating our ability to deliver growth and margin improvement a slower tariff challenged market.","Our total company operating margin was 50 basis points to 13.3%, in line with our full year 2019 plan. Free cash flow was $527 million reflecting a conversion rate of 104%. 2020 should benefit from the expense control executed in 2019 and from an improving U.S. housing market.","Before turning to the balance sheet, I want to take a moment to provide a perspective on our tariff recovery efforts and the impact on our business. We continue to mitigate the impact of current tariffs through an extensive supply chain effort and then when necessary via pricing. Through this combination of actions we were able to offset roughly $20 million of gross tariff exposure in the quarter and offset roughly $50 million for the full year.","For full year 2020, we expect gross tariff exposure in the range of roughly $55 million plus or minus $5 million which we expect to offset fully with supply chain actions and if necessary price.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash of $388 million net debt of $1.8 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now two times. We continue to have the capacity and flexibility to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases.","Turning to the details of our outlook for 2020. Based on the global market for our products growing 3% to 5% with the U.S. housing market growing 4% to 6% and Canada and Mexico being flat to slightly negative. Within this market forecast, we expect U.S. new construction growth of 5% to 8% and U.S. R&R growth, up 3% to 4%. Based on these assumptions, we expect 2020 full year sales growth of 5% to 6%. We expect full year EPS within the range of $3.83 and to $4.03.","For 2020, we expect growth to be driven by a U.S. housing market fueled by strong new construction growth and by continued share gain success via our Plumbing category expansion in China, decking distribution gains, and value price point opportunities in Cabinet.","Specifically our outlook for each business as it relates to our overall plan; Plumbing net sales growth of 5% to 7% with operating margins of 21%-plus; Doors & Security net sales growth of 4% to 7% and with operating margins of 13.5% to 14%; Cabinets net sales growth of 4% to 6% with operating margins of 10.5%-plus.","As stated earlier, tariff exposure will be roughly $55 million plus or minus $5 million. We expect to offset this exposure fully within 2020. We expect 2020 free cash flow of approximately $565 million to $585 million which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to support value price point products in Cabinets and new composite decking customers. We expect a cash conversion rate at or above 95%.","The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions; corporate expenses of about $85 million; interest expense of approximately $85 million to $90 million; a tax rate between 25% and 26%; and average fully diluted shares of approximately $141 million.","To summarize, we have put together a 2020 plan that provides solid sales and EPS growth. Potential exists for upside to our plan and guidance if some combination of the following occurs: Labor is available to address fully the U.S. new construction demand that appears to be high-single to double-digit in nature; if U.S. R&R growth improved beyond the 3% to 4% assumed in our plan; if the impact of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on cabinets from China accelerates meaningfully beyond that experience during the latter portion of the fourth quarter of 2019; better insight to these upside opportunities will unfold during the first half. As this occurs and as merited we would adjust our guidance accordingly. Our teams remain committed to driving market-leading sales performance and to continued operating margin improvement.","I will now pass the call back to Brian for some closing remarks.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Pat. That concludes our prepared remarks on the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Justin Speer","Thanks guys. Appreciate it. I wanted to start with Cabinets. Just looking at that growth there? I know it was muddled by the 53rd week last year. But with what you're seeing with anti-dumping duties, curious what you're seeing on the ground real-time and how you think your book of business will grow relative to the market in light of what you're seeing with the antidumping duties and the impact on Chinese imports?","Nick Fink","Hey, Justin. I'll start with -- if you take a step back from that start -- there's no question there is a ton of demand for value price point cabinetry. We saw that come through frankly throughout the whole year, particularly strong in the fourth quarter. And in December, I mean, plus 18% for orders for that part of the marketplace.","So, you take that as a backdrop. We have the product suite that's well set against that. We're putting in capacity to serve that. And then as you look to the anti-dumping countervailing duties to the extent that materializes or materializes even quicker than we would anticipate, I think that's an additional demand tailwind.","So, as you think about it, I mean it's been a healthy -- a very, very healthy part of the business even prior to these anti-dumping duties coming into effect. And now as we see them come into effect, there's a potential tailwind.","As we said before, there was a very big inventory hangover that needs to work its way through the system. Our estimation is that's probably coming out around now as we head into Q1 and beyond. But if you look -- if you step back and you look at our overall plan, we're projecting 4% to 6% growth for the segment. That's a pretty significant departure away from what's been call it flat to down over the last couple of years.","And even as a category inclusive of subsidizing ports, we would have estimated that we're in the 2% to 3% range. And so, we are seeing it come through. We've got a significant amount, I'd say, baked into the year. But beyond that, it's going to take a couple of years for the kind of capacity to be built in to service that part of the market, with the quality and service that our customers expect of us, if we were to size that.","Now we would guess that's probably $200 million to $300 million incremental opportunity that -- for our business at the part of the business that we want to go after with, the margin structure we want to go after then we fully intend as we continue to roll out these products and put in the capacity to go get that business.","Justin Speer","Excellent. And then, just one follow-up question for Plumbing. The growth there has been really special. And I wanted to maybe get some context, if you can unpack that growth for us by your regions or core markets and really help us understand what's going on in China. It's been a really good growth there. But what you're doing there? And how much runway you have in that growth initiative?","Nick Fink","Okay. Well, I'll give you some high-level views, and then I'll turn it over to Pat. He can give you some specifics. I'd say first, if you step back you look at a quarter like Q4 lights-out performance you look at a year like 2019 in a 9% ex-FX in what was a slow market. So, I'd say thank you for the compliment really solid performance and to put up that kind of performance it really has to come across the whole portfolio. So you do have a business that has really been firing on all cylinders. The way they're going about that I'd say is, twofold; one has been a really strong focus on reenergizing the core Moen business. So that is the Moen brand in the U.S. market and really powering that through the twin engines of brand building and innovation.","Now on the brand building front, we rolled out about a year now our hero for beautiful water campaign. And we're seeing market improvement across all spectrums of brand health, awareness, loyalty purchase intent and it's driving share gains. And as we mentioned in the remarks particularly with our targeted demographic which is the entry-level homebuyer particularly millennial-aged adults.","And so that is a really important part. And we didn't start with weak brand to begin with. We started with the strong brands. And so -- I really commend the teams' willingness to kind of disrupt themselves and drive performance there. You take that brand building and then you couple it with some of the innovation that you might have seen at KBIS and the consumer-relevant innovation that we're bringing which is not only helping -- so our share gains is helping drive reappraisal of the brand.","And so those are two really powerful pillars that are helping drive the business. And then we layer on against that. You reenergize core what we call our growth engines. So China is one of them, some of the partnerships that we brought to bear Digital Waters and other.","If you look at China specifically the growth has been excellent. The team is performing really, really well. We really do emphasize that it needs to be sustainable profitable growth. And so we want to see really nice leverage coming through that P&L and creating their fuel to reinvest in the business. They did a great job of that in 2019.","And what they've been particularly strong at is taking our core assets of Moen brand and our route to market and great key customer relationships and using it to leverage category expansion beyond just faucets and showering.","And so for example we entered sanitary where we're -- I'd say we probably have about one point of market share today starting to put up some really significant growth there. And so we feel that the path ahead of us is really, really got a long runway as we continue to expand beyond the core into areas in which there's plenty of room to still grow.","Pat do you have any other color around?","Pat Hallinan","No I would build on the comments around sustainable profitable growth I think Justin our expectation on the market in China. So the overall market is 5% or less. So we're expecting the economy inclusive of the housing economy to slowdown in China. But a lot of the strength of our growth has been through category expansion by getting into product lines that we're not into in NAFTA things like sanitary ware and our market share of sanitary ware in China is less than 1%.","And so while we would fully expect the Chinese market to moderate there's two things that we feel still remain in our favor there is: one the Chinese government does rely on housing for its overall GDP growth. So we think it's going to moderate but not crater in the near term.","And then second, we have a lot of growth from category expansion to go. And so we're managing our business in China just like we do here in the U.S. in the broader NAFTA region which is sustainable profitable growth and we expect that of the team on the ground in China and they've delivered very well against that.","Justin Speer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Phil Ng","Hey guys. Your 4% to 6% sales guidance for cabinets that's pretty impressive a sharp reacceleration. Just curious if you could unpack for us if you've layered any pricing and help us understand how many points of growth you've laid in for the tariff dynamic we're taking share in? And remind us like how much of your business in cabinets is tied in new construction?","Nick Fink","Pat, do you want to...","Pat Hallinan","Yes I would say when -- first I'll reference 2019. So you look at full year 2019 which adjusting for the 53rd week is a roughly flat year. You were seeing in any -- we have multiple value price point product offerings. You're seeing mid single digit to high single-digit growth for pre-existing brands.","Obviously things that are new like Mantra are growing off of a new base, so growing rapidly but off of a new base.","We would expect next year that, all of our entry price point brands which are quickly becoming over 50% of our business. They finished 2019 at -- in the high 40% of our business, but probably be in the 50% to 55% of our business next year.","We're going to expect them to be growing in the high-single to low double-digit range, across a range of product lines that service that market. And we're going to expect the rest of the business to be towards flat.","And that -- there is some improvement in that as well, we've been pulling back from certain parts of the higher price point business. And we've also seen some stability of semi-custom in the dealer channel not perfect stability yet.","So that's our outlook. And we would expect a lot of that growth above the market. Because you're thinking of a 4% to 6% housing market, when you're talking value price point brands growing roughly double that.","That is in part on the China import situation. But it's just also in part on consumers and tradespeople continuing to shift, towards value price point products, whether they were using imports or not previously.","Phil Ng","Got it, okay. That's really helpful. Sorry.","Nick Fink","You're really starting to see the effect of the pivot. And the balance of the portfolio as it's -- as the growing part which has been growing really well for a while, it's just become the majority of the portfolio. You just have to balance that to bounce forward towards growth.","And yes as Pat referenced those trends of kind of accelerated value price point and more stabilized dealer semi-custom, we saw that towards the end of the year. And so as that plays through, you just get a much better growth mix.","Phil Ng","Got it, that's helpful. And from a growth and performance standpoint, great to see Doors & Security bounce back. Help us understand the key drivers for what you're targeting for 2020. Certainly the Door side of things, levered to new construction?","Are you starting to see that part of the business reaccelerate and some of the operational and tariff dynamics on your security side, is it pretty much behind you. And we should expect that part of the business to kind of reaccelerate from a growth standpoint and profitability standpoint? Thanks.","Nick Fink","Okay. Let me \u2013 okay, I'll take those in parts. And then, I'll hand it to Pat for a little bit more color. I'd say if you step back from Doors and Security, I would start with a lot of growth that we expect to come out of Fiberon. So we're very, very focused on the expansion of the Fiberon opportunity.","And as a reminder, the main opportunity there is against what that's 80% of the market. And as we go in there we saw the strong consumer brand against kind of unbranded wood. And put the expansion into our bicoastal footprint.","And again it's our new distribution gains. We expect a fair amount of growth to come out of that business. That started to go in and -- at the end of last year, as we start to shift towards our distribution gains. And I'd say that, it was tracking ahead of expectations.","And so, we feel very good about the Fiberon opportunity. And now we've talked to you on that in a bit more detail. If you go over to Doors, Doors from a POS perspective actually performed really well, in the fourth quarter. We had some inventory rebalancing inside of retail.","We're -- believe we're through that now. And then, we do expect as you point out to see some acceleration on the wholesale side with exposure to new construction there. And inventory was fairly lean throughout the year. And so, that is a nice opportunity as we're through that rebalancing.","And then, security yes, through the operational challenges associated with that kind of product platform change that we did -- saw the big bounce back in margin which is really healthy and then some nice performance coming through. And so, that will be much more post that just kind of back to good execution mode.","Pat Hallinan","Yeah. I mean so all the businesses grew both in the quarter and the year. And I think as you look -- that's referencing 2019, obviously. As you look into 2020, as Nick referenced, we would expect decking to grow roughly mid-teens or better.","We would expect Doors to move with the U.S., new construction and R&R market it's probably 60-plus percent new construction. So it's going to be in the mid-single digits and it will travel higher than that. If the labor is available, because it certainly seems like there's new construction demand and that's really strong. And then we would expect our security business to be in the low to mid-single digits, depending on the mix of business. But all businesses grew in the quarter and the year. The issues that challenged us at the end of 2018 security are long behind us and the team is very focused on both growth and margin expansion across all the business units.","Phil Ng","That\u2019s great color. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Timothy Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Timothy Wojs","Hey, guys good afternoon.","Nick Fink","Hey, Tim.","Timothy Wojs","Maybe just on Cabinets. Maybe if you could give us just a little bit of an update on where you feel you are from a capacity standpoint particularly on the semi-custom business. So I think that that business has maybe undershot your expectations in 2019? And it seems like you're seeing a little bit of a recovery there. So just kind of curious when you think you can align some of the capacity there for more of a flat to flattish type market","Nick Fink","Yeah, I would estimate we'll be through that by the end of 2020. So there's still some work to do. Most of the work has been done the team has put a lot of gains that I think now we're probably in the final stretches, but expect a bit more to come out as we just rebalance it and make it more efficient. And it's not -- it wasn't just as simple as taking a bit out.","The route to doing that was a big amount of work against creating a network that was far more flexible across all of our nodes than you historically have seen in the cabinet business. And so as we come out of the backside, it's really about having a more effective footprint I think is the way to think about it probably, more variable ability to drive across different areas of it. And so if growth were to come through that we would have the flexibility to address it. But we'd start out from a much better cost position.","If I estimate by the end of the year we're probably through that. I'd say it's been phasing accelerating with Dave Banyard's leadership in there and really pressing on both accelerators of getting through that -- the semi-custom rebalancing as well as putting in more capacity on the value and stock side of the business where we're seeing such growth.","Timothy Wojs","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then just on Plumbing just the overall growth guide for 2020. So you guys did close to 9%, which is great in 2019. And you're guiding more to a slowdown there I guess in 2020 despite seeing faster new construction I think that business tends to be overweight in new constructions. So could you just, kind of, true us up on why exactly that would be happening? Or why is it exactly we see a deceleration?","Pat Hallinan","Yeah, Tim we call that the Plumbing business in total has a healthy chunk call it two-thirds or thereabouts that is R&R. And even within that R&R it has just a pure replace component that is a bit unique to plumbing versus the rest of our home products business. And so we have -- we're expecting a modest R&R acceleration. They don't call it 3.5% plus or minus half a percentage point and pure replace tends to trail below that and then we're moderating China a bit. And so I think it's nothing more than the mix of a U.S. housing market that we expect to be in -- somewhere in the 4% to 6% range and beat that and then have China be in the teens or thereabouts.","Timothy Wojs","Okay, okay. Sounds good, Appreciate the color guys. Good luck on 2020.","Pat Hallinan","Thank you.","Nick Fink","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","Nick Fink","Hi, Michael.","Michael Rehaut","First question I had was on how you're thinking about capital deployment this year and next. Obviously you guys have always taken a pretty balanced approach between -- after the necessary CapEx, balancing it between bolt-on opportunities or acquisitions and share repurchase.","With the strong free cash flow generation expected just trying to get a sense of number one, how you see the M&A backdrop today in terms of the opportunity set in front of you? Is it greater or lesser than it's been? And maybe talk about valuations a little bit. And if that remains a little quieter this year if we could expect an acceleration of share repurchase?","Nick Fink","Sure. I'd be happy to talk about that. And so just again the priorities we've always been consistent and very clear. First and foremost, we do look for opportunities within the business. Those are our highest returns. And we have some really nice things that we're investing behind that are going to drive good growth. And then next, we go to target an M&A and it's accretive. And to the extent beyond that we look to return excess capital to the shareholders. And so that's kind of our clear priority in that order.","If you look within M&A specifically, our priorities are going to remain within Plumbing and Outdoor Living. But we are also always evaluating other branded higher margin opportunities where we feel that we could drive incremental value by leveraging the FBHS model into them and Fiberon is a great example of that. We had a model and a playbook that we thought we could bring to it. We had an asset in a route to market system through Therma-Tru that was best-in-class. And so bringing the brand building capability the route to market capability again is something like that. That's allowed us to drive a lot of value and give it for our shareholders.","And so that's how we're thinking about opportunities. Specifically with respect to flow, M&A was slow in 2019. I think there's no question. And as should be expected I think in a year where the housing market was slower sellers probably cinched the year working their businesses and driving to better performance. I'm not going to get into the business of trying to predict whether things get done or not, but if I'm to measure it by the level of activity, I would say for sure that activity has increased and we're definitely seeing increased inbounds that our team is working on.","And so it does feel that as we're coming into this strengthening housing market there is increased activity in M&A and you can just sort of play out probability against that. That said, you touched on valuations as well. We will stay disciplined. We've got a good track record for being disciplined and we will be disciplined. And against high valuations, we're really going to focus on the quality of synergies and the quality of value creation that we can bring and hold the bar high on that.","With respect to buybacks, we do run our model against the stock and against our plan and what we expect our plan to deliver in terms of value accretion for shareholders and tend to look opportunistically to buy stock as we have in the past. In 2019, we spent about $100 million. And our stock is still undervalued. There's a way to go. And so as we kind of balance out those opportunities, we'll be testing the value against what we know to be our value creation as we go along.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate all those comments. I guess for my second question, I just wanted to revisit cabinets for a moment, obviously, a big transition over the last couple of years. And the comments you made around the new management team continuing to accelerate some of the transition work that you're doing. I just wanted to get a little bit of perspective in terms of perhaps what inning you think we're in, in terms of that transition? Because obviously we've heard a lot of the restructuring and the capacity shifts have been ongoing now for perhaps 18 months or so.","So just trying to get a sense of where we are in that process? How much further you think we need to go? Because obviously that also comes along with it maybe a little bit higher or temporary areas of expense or disruption or inefficiency and would there be another step function improvement let's say if we're still getting through that this year another step function improvement and profitability to expect in 2021?","Nick Fink","Sure. I'd start by saying I think we're in the later innings of the pivot in U.S., it's been going on for a long time and it has been monumental. Shifting this footprint to the extent we've shifted it. I think the outcomes of the fruit that's bearing off of that is the kind of growth that we're expecting in 2020.","And so if you think about -- we've had to make the change to get to a point where our footprint supports that kind of growth. That would indicate to me that we're in the later stages of the pivot. And come to a point where in 2020, we're indicating 4% to 6% growth with meaningful margin progress.","No, we're not done, but a lot of the changes are well underway. And now we're starting to see the benefits.","Now you look a little bit even within Q4, and we're encouraged by seeing really, really strong orders at that value price point where we're putting in the last piece of plus 18% for December and seeing stabilized semi-custom orders in Q4 in our dealer channel against that semi-custom business. And then you look to the margin performance within that and Pat touched on this that we saw some temporary inefficiency as we ramped more Mexico capacity. And you're right. I mean it is very hard to do and you experience inefficiency along the way.","We're now through that and we're seeing the solid margin progress that we expected to see not coming through the business, as we're through it end of December and into January. And so just another good proof point to us that as we round the corner on the pivot and starts to look for that kind of growth and margin accretion we have the business pointed in the right way, we have the capacity where we need it and we're starting to get the performance out of it.","And so there is work to do. We will continue to rebalance in the customer activity working really, really hard to put in more value price point capacity. And with the growth rates, we're seeing we're going to have to add capacity there. But I believe in 2020, you're going to see the benefit of the work that's been done over the last 18 months come through from both the top line and a margin perspective.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Thanks very much.","Nick Fink","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good evening.","Nick Fink","Hi. Susan.","Susan Maklari","My first question is just can you talk a little bit to the raw material environment that you are seeing as we go into 2020, how that's kind of baked into some of these margins in some of the margin guidance you've given us? And how we should be thinking about it coming through over the course of the year?","Pat Hallinan","Yeah. So for -- I'll start with 2019 and I'll go to 2020 to put them both in perspective. So 2019, I'd say total inflation commodities tariffs logistics was about $80 million, $85 million in total a little more than 2% of cost of goods sold. And of that $80 million, $85 million about $50-ish million was tariffs.","As we look into 2020 and we look at inflation again looking at those same three components we would see full year inflation in the $40 million to $50 million range. So roughly 1% of COGS and about $10 million of that is logistics. And so in terms of inflation it's about half the rate that we saw in 2019 and we'll offset it with supply chain and where necessary price.","Tariffs a bit more, I'd say, a complicated element in the sense that what things are falling off versus coming on. So I kind of put tariffs into a non-inflationary discussion they were about $50 million in total in 2019, they'll be about $55 million in total to the P&L in 2020, but that is with again certain things falling off new things annualizing and some things coming off the balance sheet.","So I think of tariffs less of an inflation driver and more of a year-over-year almost flat dynamic we're dealing with. We will exit the year with some tariff favorability as some of the balance sheet stuff comes off in the first half of the year. But you shouldn't see a margin profile cadence throughout the year that is driven by any real specific inflationary or tariff dynamic. None of them are big enough relative to the supply chain and pricing actions in the quarter.","And most of what's driving the 2019 result and the 2020 result in terms of tariffs are different board product and other hardwood product glass and logistics much more so than metals.","Susan Maklari","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then to follow-up You mentioned in your remarks Nick that there is upside to this guide and to your results this year depending on how things move obviously with all the initiatives you have going on as well as the macro. But as you kind of look across the business and the opportunity set and the things that you are doing, where do you see the most opportunity? Where could we expect the most upside in there? And how do you think about that coming through?","Nick Fink","Well, I'll take a step back and for starters, I look at almost 2019 is the proof point right \u2013 I couldn't be prouder of our team's performance in 2019. Frankly, it was a year we came into \u2013 ended up with a softer market than we anticipated and all sorts of stuff coming at us. And the business outperformed the market, right. It solidly outperformed the market. We got some margin accretion. And so if you take that kind of momentum and you place it against our assumptions for 2020, what we've done in 2020 is we built a plan that will outperform the market. And I would take that as the starting point.","Now, we've made assumptions around what we think the market will do. We're seeing some really encouraging figures from builders. We have to assume a rate at which that activity is going to convert from builder order books into permits starts and then our orders. We see R&R and we see demand for housing, we see a really favorable interest rate environment on mortgages we've got to make a \u2013 we've made some, I'd say, fairly prudent assumptions about the rate at which R&R could improve over the course of the year.","And then we put around at a plan in which we go, well, we're going to beat that market. So the underlying premise is to the extent that that market turns out to be better we expect to still have market outperformance and that's where we'll see upside and that upside would place us towards the high end of our guidance and that's conceptually how we think about it.","Now, where would that come through? Well, new construction is an area, which we've made a set of assumptions to the extent that builders are able to get labor conversion in foster or productivity of labor out. There could be some upside there, if R&R strengthens or in another area is if the antidumping countervailing duties have an even foster effect on our Cabinets business than we've anticipated. All of those are areas for opportunity. If you look then how that plays out against the portfolio, one thing that's really nice about our portfolio is we've got this balanced exposure to that R&R market about two-thirds of the portfolio, but we've got some really nice exposure to the new construction market. And the way, we work it is in a slow year like 2019, we'll manage expenses very tightly to still deliver a good year for shareholders. But in a year with some market tailwind as we expect 2020 to be we really hope to enjoy that exposure to the new construction. And that plays out to varying degrees, but it plays out throughout the portfolio. And so I think if you look at Plumbing Doors Decking, I mean, all of those and of course Cabinets are exposed to some of that new construction tailwind.","Operator","And that's all the time that we have for questions.

Following our prepared remarks, we have allowed some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. In the second quarter, our teams continue to execute at a high level in self market. I'm proud of the progress we have made, particularly in a market that looks as if it will now grow only in the 2% to 2.5% range in 2019. Although we anticipated a soft first half market, the market overall was softer than we expected in the second quarter particularly in Canada.","Despite the market, we're making solid progress on the business plans we communicated in February which were centered on delivering shareholder value even through periods of more moderate market growth. [Indiscernible] great discipline on capital expenses and I'm very pleased with our progress for the first half of the year. By continuing to manage our businesses tightly with investments focused only on those areas needed to support new business and growth, we put ourselves in a solid position to grow in the second half of the year and into 2020 as the market begins to reaccelerate.","We will first take you to our updated view of the U.S. home products market, next I will provide my perspective on our business performance in the second quarter. Then Nick Fink, our President and Chief Operating Officer will provide some insight into how we are driving our businesses for growth and performance improvement followed by Pat who will provide more details on our second quarter and 2019 outlook.","Starting with our updated view of the U.S. home product market. In the second quarter, the market for our home products were softer and came in below even the moderate pace we have planned for. We estimate that the market for our products grew below 2% in the quarter, but the repair and remodel market growing around 3%. The construction spending on our product categories was approximately flat as our business typically lags starts activity by a quarter or so and we continue to feel some impact from the weak industry performance at the start of the year.","In terms of the quarter, we started out within April that was in-line with our weaker outlook followed by a very wet and soft May. June orders were an improvement from the trend, but overall the market in the second quarter for our products was weaker than expected. We are now seeing some signs of the building season extending out later in the year and see indicators of stronger consumer demand for housing.","Order rates have been healthier late June and into July and one of the slow ramp up we're seeing now is one we would have expected to see back in late April and May, to-date that is pointing to a modest pick up in market growth in the second half of 2019. Solo ramp up in building product demand will only begin to show up at our results later in the third quarter and shift primarily benefit the fourth quarter and set us up for a solid start in 2020.","Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance in the second quarter. The second quarter, sales increased 5% in total and 6% excluding FX. On the top line, we performed well given the market particularly outside of Canada where the market continued to trend lower in the period. Total company sales growth excluding Canada was up 7%. Total company operating margin was 14.1%. This is a solid result in light of [ph] the softer market, continued tariffs at the 25% level, the investments we are making related to our Cabinet business mostly in Mexico and incremental expense to support the additional capacity endorsed in Fiberon.","Overall our performance in the quarter was driven by a tough posture on cost management as we work to offset the market. Solid growth and margins in plumbing and strong sales of the value cabinets were offset by weaker trends in made-to-order cabinets and the impact from wet weather on our doors and decking outdoor product lines. Despite the headwinds, we continue to be aggressive with our cost controls and our pricing and supply chain actions are working to offset tariffs and other inflation.","Now turning to the segments beginning with Plumbing. The global Plumbing group continued to outperform the market with sales growth excluding FX of over 6% and margin at 22.6% in the quarter. Growth was driven by above-market POS in the U.S. and continued strong growth in China as we expand our product offering and take share. Continued strong performance in our core markets more than offset the weakest in Canada where sales were down low double-digits excluding FX.","In Cabinets, I'm quite encouraged by the continued progress our team is making in pivoting the business toward growth. Sales in the targeted value part of the market which is now approaching 50% of our total business were up low-double digits in the quarter and above our expectations as we continue to have success here and take share with our soft products.","Sales of semi-custom made-to-order cabinets contracted in the high single digit range which is in part the result of our own success in driving simpler high-margin product solutions to meet the changing consumer demand.","Overall, the trend is as we thought and we're accelerating some pivot actions in response to a faster transitioning market including ramping up additional stock capacity in Mexico as our current facilities already stretched their limits. To take the more aggressive cost to action by capacity in the semi-custom business.","Margin performance in light of all of our actions is encouraging as we navigate a near-term drag on efficiency due to large-scale changes we're making to the business and its supply chains in the midst of the soft market along with some new product launch expenses.","Our overall cabinet sales reflect in a market that we believe was also flat for the quarter. It's clear that we're on the right track as we continue pivoting the Cabinet business towards growth markets and reduce the cost and capacity of serving the weaker segments of the market.","In our drawers and Security segment, sales drop 19% and flat excluding Fiberon. From this group, Doors continue to perform well given the softer new construction environments and a challenging comp from last year's retail program went an inventory low.","In decking, we've been leveraging our unique Therma-Tru distribution strength and reputation for quality and service to attract new and existing customers to Fiberon. Due to our recent program wins, we're accelerating investment in the second half of this year to capitalize in growth opportunities that will begin to be realized in the fourth quarter and we're significantly into 2020.","Heading in Security, our Master Lock brand is back on track on the strength of significantly improved product, quality and service levels following the big product change over the last summer. Overall, we continue to execute on the plans across the businesses for profitable growth and I'm honestly growing housing market that we highlighted at our February investor day and I'm pleased with our progress. Although the market so far this year is picking up later than we would have expected, our business has continued to execute at a high level and consumers are responding favorably to our brands and other product initiatives across our categories.","So while the softer market and slower ramp in housing activity this year prompts a reduction to the high end over full year 2019 EPS outlook, I'm encouraged by our performance and the continued strong fundamentals underpinning on market. Given prevailing low interest rates, moderating new and existing home prices and continued strong consumer jobs and wage data. The impact from the aggressive actions we are taking across the company to position ourselves for growth will be better-reflected in our financials as we move into the fourth quarter.","Before I wrap up, let me return to our capital deployment in the quarter in our broader plan to create long term incremental value. Year-to-date through July, we have spent $50 million on share repurchases or about 1.1 million shares at an average price of $47. We plan to continue to use share repurchases opportunistically as a vehicle to generate attractive returns consistent with prior practice.","We also continue to evaluate a pipeline of potential acquisitions. Any potential acquisitions in the balance of the year are more likely to be built on opportunities within our core business categories focused on plumbing and outdoor living. While we continue to evaluate select larger acquisition opportunities, sellers of larger companies for the most part appear to be waiting which could change next year when the market reaccelerates.","With our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we continue to have the capacity and flexibility to make strategic acquisitions to purchase additional shares and increase our dividend to create meaningful incremental shareholder value while still deleveraging naturally over time. As a reminder, over the next three years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy an additional $3 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Nick who will provide more detail on how we are driving performance across the segments.","Nicholas Fink","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Since March, I've been working closely with the operating teams to execute on the plans to be highlighted at our Investor Day to deliver long term shareholder value by driving unique strategies for profitable growth, all in the backdrop of a modestly growing U.S. housing market.","Our actions are driving significant improvement across the company and are positioning us to capture more predictable growth as we head into the back half of the year in 2020. As I've worked with the teams across our businesses, I'm impressed with the aggressive actions we are taking specifically the ongoing sets we're taking to build up the brands, capabilities, product portfolio and partnerships in our global continues to leverage competitive advantages and lead the industry from both the sales growth and margin perspective.","The pivoting of our Cabinets business towards innovative product and value price points primarily through expansion capacity in Mexico to support growing sales of stock Cabinet that have run ahead of projection [indiscernible], our entry price point product for the dealer channel and reducing fixed cost in capacity in semi-custom. So the repositioning business takes more value in the face of changing consumer takes and competitive threats.","In Doors & Security, the targeted smart investments that we are making in the business such as in Therma-Tru where we are making incremental investments to support new product launches and our continued investment in Fiberon is zero-tear [ph] 100% made in the USA business that uses 94% recycled content in this manufacturing. Like Therma-Tru, this business benefits from the accelerating trend towards performance materials and material conversion away from wood, plus the opportunity to grow significantly in channels in which we already have a strong presence.","And finally, the competitive repositioning across our company from some of our supply chains out of China which helped us for sure low cost to supply for our efficient and more automated manufacturing as well as mitigate the impact of tariffs.","About 10 months ago as we announced the acquisition of Fiberon, we detailed plans to leverage our existing relationships and strong Therma-Tru distribution in order to grow in the outdoor living segment with the market. Since that time, we've added significant multi-state distributors including Wolf [ph] across the northeast in Weeks Building product across the upper midwest. Last week, we announced that the Fiberon team is set to expand distribution significantly across the west and the southwest with the addition of OrePac building products.","OrePac is a best-in-class large wholesale distributor and existing Therma-Tru customer. This partnership has been instrumental to our western U.S. growth in Fiberon stores. We're looking forward to deepening our relationship with OrePac through the additional Fiberon as both of our companies seek additional opportunities for growth and outdoor living.","In addition to the segment-specific initiatives, we're also working harder across the company to better-leverage common custom distribution opportunities, ecommerce expansion initiatives, connected home product innovations and stronger scale-driven indirect spending initiatives.","In summary, that's been in my role for a short time that I have seen so far is exciting and our planning and execution remains solid. I've seen many opportunities for possible growth across these businesses which position us well to continue to outperform the market and our competition.","With that, I will turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Hallinan","Thanks, Nick. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.5 billion, up 5% from a year ago and 1% on an organic basis excluding Fiberon. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $212 million, up 1% or $3 million compared to the same quarter last year.","Total company operating margin was 14.1%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of around 50 basis points of full-year operating margin improvement despite a softer market and the increased tariff rate of 25% on imports from China.","EPS were $1.03 for the quarter versus $1 of the same quarter last year, an increase of 3%. EPS were in-line with our expectation and we are pleased by our team's continued ability to grow sales and earnings during the period of softer market growth, the persistence of a challenging trade environment and while navigating significant supply chain transitions within most of our businesses.","Now let me provide more color on segment results, beginning with plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $506 million, up $22 million or 5% and mark the first $0.5 billion quarter in plumbings history. Excluding currency, sales were up over 6% in the quarter, which was above our expectation given the 9% organic sales growth rate during the same period last year. Mid-single digit USPOS [ph] and continued strong growth in China drove the quarter with reported sales results muted by Canadian housing market weakness and unfavorable FX.","Plumbing operating income increased 13% to $114 million. Operating margin was 22.6%, an excellent result driven by cost discipline and sales leverage in the U.S. and China. We continue to be on-track with our full year outlook in plumbing with sales up in the mid to high single digit range and with operating margin around 21%.","Doors & Security sales were $366 million, up $58 million or 19% from the prior year quarter driven by Fiberon. Sales in the base business were flat driven by doors which was impacted by a soft second quarter U.S. new construction market and having to comp the inventory load-in associated with 2018 retail distribution gains, which drove 20% growth in the prior year quarter.","Operating income increased 5% to $50 million. Income growth was muted by a price to tariff lag in Security that will be resolved during the second half, atypical doors mix associated with retail inventory rebalancing and a strong comp to last year and new capacity ramp up in efficiencies in doors and decking.","We remain on-track to deliver high-teens sales growth in the full year with segment operating margins of around 13.5% in 2019, driven by incremental distribution and capacity investments associated with Fiberon distribution gain. We expect our base Therma-True and Master Lock businesses to grow organic sales in the mid-single digit range in 2019.","Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the second quarter were $635 million or roughly flat versus the prior year quarter. Sales of stock cabinetry in the U.S. were up 12% including entry price point in stock product up mid-teens and builder great product, up mid-teen and builder great product up mid single digits. U.S. made-to-order cabinetry sale which includes semi-custom and premium product were down in high single digits -- in Canada, it was down high-teens.","Sales in the segments of the cabinet market to which we are pivoting our business grew stronger than expected as demand for simple bath and kitchen remodel projects continues to be strong. The successful launch of Mantra, our new entry price point product for the dealer channel that Nick referred to earlier is on-track to contribute materially to full-year growth.","Operating income in the second quarter was $67 million, down $14 million or 17% versus the prior year. Operating margin was 10.6% and in-line with our expectation for the quarter as we navigate temporary transitional inefficiencies associated with the pivot and new product launch specifically new facility ramp up cost and tariffs associated with the safety stock as we complete an exit from Chinese wood products this year. For the full year, we expect Cabinet sales growth in the low single digit range or roughly in-line with the Cabinet market. Full year margin is expected to be around 10%.","For the company, to sum up consolidated second quarter performance, sales increased 5%, 6% excluding FX and EPS were consistent with our plan at $1.03, demonstrating our ability to execute and drive growth in strong margin in a slower market. Our total company operating margin was 14.1%, but financial discipline and expense control we displayed in the first half will continue into the second half as we position ourselves to accelerate our financial performance in a gradually improving market.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our June 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $276 million, net debt of $2.1 billion and our net debt to EBITDA leverage is 2.4x. We continue to have the capacity and flexibility to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases as we delever naturally during the second half of the year and over time.","Year-to-date, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $50 million. Our approach to share repurchases continues to be opportunistic and focused on where we can generate significant returns. We have approximately $364 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2019. As Chris mentioned, we adjusted the top end of our 2019 EPS outlook to reflect the softer market. We now expect EPS within the range of $3.53 to $3.67 versus the prior range of $3.53 to $3.77 driven by the market and incremental distribution and capacity investments associated with Fiberon's distribution gain. We expect most of this EPS guidance provision to impact the third quarter, given the soft second quarter permits and starts in the U.S. and expected continued Canadian market softness.","The updated midpoint of $3.60 represents 8% EPS growth versus the prior year. We now expect the full year sales growth of 5.5% to 6.5% versus the prior range of 6% to 7.5%. While the market is recovering more slowly than we initially anticipated, we are encouraged by the improvement to and stability of demand drivers critical to the U.S. housing market. In particular housing affordability, employment and wage growth and by our business performance specifically the momentum on our plumbing business in the U.S. and China, that demands strength in the market segments to which we are pivoting our Cabinet business and Fiberon's distribution gains.","We expect 2019 free cash flow of approximately $480 million to $500 million which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to support new composite decking customer. We anticipate a cash conversion rate at or above 95%.","The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions. Interest expense of around $94 million, a tax rate between 25% and 26%. In average, fully diluted shares of approximately $142 million. In summary, our businesses are executing well in the soft market and continuing to deliver structural improvements that will better-reflect as we move into the fourth quarter and next year.","During 2019, we anticipate our balanced approach of cost management, supply chain changes and price will fully offset tariff and other inflation within the year. We will improve our overall margin by approximately 50 basis points and drive 5.5% to 6.5% sales growth for approximately 4% growth on an organic basis in a market growing 2% to 2.5%. Our teams continue to execute well and manage expenses tightly while making rapid progress on our strategic initiatives.","I will now pass the call back to Chris for some closing remark.","Chris Klein","Before we begin the Q&A session, let me build on Pat's closing comments and leave you with two high-level thoughts as well. We are operating at a very intense level right now across our company, transforming supply change, executing pricing actions, simultaneously ramping up and taking down capacity to reposition businesses, launching innovation, expanding and growing categories and channels, integrating acquisitions and partnerships and winning new business.","Over the past nine months we've been doing this in a deccelerating market with tech controls and expenses in capital. As we turn the quarter and move into a gradually accelerating home products market, in the latter part of this year and into 2020, we will see some significant leverage and an even higher degree of impact from all of the actions we've taken to position the business for the next wave of growth.","And while I'm pleased with our first half results, I'm even more excited about the growth in margin opportunities in front of us.","With that, I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks on the second quarter of 2019. We will now begin taking a limited number of question. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then re-enter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Weiss from Baird. Your line is open.","Timothy Weiss","Good afternoon, everybody. Maybe just to start off first on the market. I guess I'm curious what you thought Q2 was really representative of. Is it just kind of the delay from some of the weakening metrics that we've seen in housing over the last couple of quarters. Do you feel that would be just underlying R&R market is maybe just a touch softer. I'm just curious if it's more of a timing issue in your mind or if it's something that's maybe that growth curve is maybe just a little less?","Chris Klein","Effectively, the second quarter was softer and delayed because of the reacceleration we expected. We're seeing that now. I think we lost a quarter along the way here where we would have expected the kind of activity that we're feeling right now and late April-May, that's what we're experiencing. So that will lead to we think a healthy fall building construction in R&R. But we've incorporated that loss level of activity in the second quarter and slower ramp into the third quarter into what we're guided. I think the market is still healthy if you look at overall demand both for new construction, especially at the entry level point and R&R, it's still strong. I think there are parts of the country that it was tough to do R&R work especially outdoor R&R work in late April and all of May and that didn't start picking up again until June, so that impacted things like decking, doors and other outdoor activity. But we think that 3% plus on our growth for the year accelerating into the normal 4% to 5% in the next year is a healthy market.","Clearly the existing housing stock turnover was a little softer. The impact of lower rates will eventually help that as housing price appreciation has moderated both in new construction and in the existing housing turn. So all those things set up for a better second half and we think a pretty healthy market. We're not calling for an honest acceleration here, we're calling for modest acceleration into the second half and that's what our guidance has indicated.","Timothy Weiss","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then maybe I'm curious to review just on your high-level view on inventories, just kind of what you're seeing with your customers. You did note a pretty good POS in plumbing. So just curious in some of your stock businesses, how you fill your customer inventories book right now.","Chris Klein","I'll let Nick address that.","Nicholas Fink","Sure. Hey, Tim. How are you?","Timothy Weiss","Good. You?","Nicholas Fink","Well, thanks. Yes, I would say if you look across, inventories are pretty much leaned up. In the first half, I think they've worked to it and pulled back a fair amount. The way we see it is pretty lean. We're now tracking some POS. I would say that's been ahead of shipment. We just like to feel encouraged by the underlying market and that pointed us for some really nice acceleration. As it picks up, we'll get some leverage up off of inventories coming back on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Speer from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Justin Speer","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Just a couple questions. One, in terms of the guidance revision. How much do you estimate that revision was from tariffs and how much from slowing growth and willfully apparently is a list for tariff on the table, how should we think about that in the context of this guidance as well.","Pat Hallinan","Justin, it's Pat. Our guidance adjustment is virtually 100% market-driven. We have adjusted our market outlook to 2% to 2.5% versus the original 2% to 4%. So roughly by 100 basis points and have adjusted our topline by roughly 100 basis points and we're flowing it through at a leverage rate of about 21% which is consistent with the leverage weight we had for our full year plan and outlook. But the adjustment is really a market adjustment. The range around it reflects a little bit of the timing on certainty with some of the OrePac distribution gains and when inventories will or won't flow into that new distributor. But that's really what's driving the change to our outlook. In terms of the list for tariffs which reemerge under the radar screen this afternoon, it's obviously something we've been tracking for a couple of years now. We've been dealing with tariffs of one form or another consistently since 2017. We've been attacking them very actively and aggressively with a balanced cost out and price approach. The list for tariffs, I'm sure there will be more emerging in the coming days in terms of specifics, but our tracking of them here is that anything coming out of that will be smaller than the amounts we've dealt with with list one, two, three and [indiscernible] with tariffs we would expect to manage them as effectively as we've managed previous tariffs.","In 2018 we offset roughly $45 million to $50 million worth of tariff expense in total inflation. This year we'll have about $60 million of total tariff-only inflation and we'll offset this year and navigate it. There's no change at the guidance that's driven with tariffs. The 25% tariff uptick was three, was something we obviously were aware it could happen this year. It came about probably a bit more abruptly than twe would have thought of, but we're dealing with it with cost out and with pricing.","Chris Klein","With that said on our approach here, we've taken a very methodical balanced approach to move our supply chains and de-emphasize China we think is a long term trend, so we've been working this for the last two to three years and then we talk before our incremental approach to pricing. So we take frequent smaller price increases and that combined with our supply chain changes have offset the tariffs and positioned us well in the market to continue to grow. So we're competitive in our market, we're growing ahead of our market while at the same time offsetting the impact of the tariff. We think that's a really competitively sound approach and we've had a lot of success with it.","Justin Speer","Okay. And one follow-up question for me if I can get to sneak one in. On the Doors & Security business, how much of that headwind to the margins from investments. I don't know if you're going to pack that with some investments in the business versus the tariffs and the mixed drag in terms of the full year expectation just thinking about the phasing of these new investments and then maybe the actual revenue benefit. Maybe help us think about how you think that phases in this year or next year?","Chris Klein","I would say that really, we tuned up the margin expectation on that business only slightly due to both some of the weather losses; we don't fully expect to recover this year and some of the investments [indiscernible] expect to make at the end of the year. When we came out with our original guidance for that whole segment, we're sitting on roughly 100 basis points, the margin improvement versus 2018 which was roughly 14% and we'll be in the 13.5%-ish for that business -- call it 50 basis points. But it's really driven by a weather softened second quarter and some of the investments were going to be both making in capacity and feel the sales and marketing as we roll out some new distribution agreements. Going forward, that segment in total should be tracking to 15% plus over the next three years with the decking business swimming along right at the average of the whole segment.","Justin Speer","Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is just around the Cabinets business and understand the comments around the guy that just specifically related to Cabinets, the scenario where as you pivoted, there have been some concerns about the ability to really ramp up growth and margin. It was never going to be quite linear yet tough comps here as well. But can you just give us a little more detail about what you're seeing that gives you confidence that the plans that you have laid out in the investor day are still on-track here?","Chris Klein","Yes. I'd say we're pretty excited about where the Cabinet business has gone the first half of the year. The stock value part of the market which is now for us about half of our business grew 12% of the quarter. That's much stronger than what we had anticipated and it's a success of position in that market. We're taking share, executing well, that's just not in stock in home centers, that's also through dealers that's the builder market. Where we're going to is accelerating faster. The soft part of the market which is semi-custom premium special order declined high single digits which is consistent with where we think the market was overall. That's our plan. So we call that out a couple of years ago and that part of market is decreasing. That decrease in this softer market overall accelerated a bit. So our reaction to that is we're investing more in capacity in Mexico and then our DA system in the U.S. to support that stock business and we're moving even faster to take capacity out in the part of the market that's not growing in that semi-custom part of the marketplace. Actually, everything is consistent with where we've been driving this business for the last two years and if anything accelerated in second quarter, we think it will continue to move into the second half.","One thing I've noticed, we've talked a bit about the China imports. We think the impact of some of the tariffs that are already in place are slowing that and we await the -- out of the commerce on the anti-dumping and we think that's beneficial as well. We've noted in the market that less of that product is coming into the market and that will work its way into less relevance down the road. I'd say everything we've laid out including everything we talked about in the investor day is in-line. I kind of look at it like a teeter-totter a little bit and part of the market that stock value part teeter-tottered up a little bit more in the semi-custom teeter-totter [ph] down a little bit more and we've responded in kind and are accelerating. So we're getting to our end state on a rapid base and I like where we're positioned competitively in the market.","I think the margin coming in at -- what was [ph] consistent with our plan and we're going to see the year -- there was some inefficiency in the second quarter as we're managing through floor capacity down at Mexico and carrying a little bit of excess capacity in that semi-custom premium and we're speeding up the ramp there. So we're still going to come in 10% at least on the margin size in Cabinets and we're still going to come in positive in the low single digits on growth and that's I think better than the market overall and we're positioned well for the future. I think as you said at the beginning, they're a little messy, but this has been a little messy for a little while, but we're real comfortable with where we're managing, too. I think it was just an acceleration of those trends in this second quarter.","Michael Dahl","Thanks for the comprehensive answer. Chris, that is helpful. And then my second question, just if I brought it out a bit, Nick, I think this is your first time on the call. You outlined in your prepared remarks a number of different initiatives. I think some of them have been under way. Some of them are newer. Can you talk a little bit more about as you've gotten deeper into your new role, what are few of the initiatives that you highlighted where you'd look at those and you really point out some that are real needle movers and then what are some of the other things that you've seen over this past few months that maybe you do differently moving forward?","Nicholas Fink","Sure. I'm happy to talk about that. I'll sit back for a second and just say and be in this role and looking across, it's hard not to be excited by how well our teams are executing across the businesses in the softer market while they're also moving some really big growth initiatives going forward and making significant. If you look at all of that happening in the results; while they're really moving those big initiatives, that sets itself to accelerate really quickly as the market accelerates. So that's just a great and a lot of times [indiscernible], but then as you mentioned in addition, we're also working on a number of initiatives across spending more time with the customers together. We're sharing insights, we're leveraging the relationships that we have across business to open up new points of distribution and new types of programming.","We're also I think doing a better job leveraging across the business in doing things like developing our ecommerce flexibilities which we've grown up in different parts of the segment geared towards different parts of the market that are very leverageable capability. Same applies also for connected home products. We've bulked that up in different parts of Security and plumbing. Those teams are now working more closely together to develop the next gen of products leveraging the capabilities that we felt.","The cost side, we're also driving incremental value here by really leveraging our indirect spending power much better across the entire enterprise and then you put those into the backdrop of just working hard at the strategies that are articulated during our investor day in Boston which I think is proven to be spot on. [Indiscernible] constantly looking for opportunities then on and accelerate those strategy a lot of time there. And then as we move through the strategic planning cycle, really working on what is the next horizon of growth. So you sum all that together, really encouraging to have really solid performance in the soft market while building initiatives which set us up to accelerate really nicely if the market picks up.","Michael Dahl","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Phil Ng","Hi, guys. Can you give us a sense where you are with your price increases for the full 25% tariffs? The reason why I'm asking is because of yours report, it seem like they saw a bigger list on margins with costs associated with the tariffs not really coming in later in the year and they got pricing now. Not sure if your approach of smaller increases had an impact.","Pat Hallinan","Phil, it's Pat. There are a few areas where we're working price increases in on the 25% range, but our approach is balance. So we have been aware at 25%, was a potential outcome for the year, then we're going to cross all of our businesses on a mix of cost and price and there's a few areas where people have some second half pricing coming in, but it's not the only way we're addressing the 25% tariff. Consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year and our guidance coming out of the first quarter, we're going to address inflation inclusive of tariffs with a mix of cost in freight. The total amount of inflation for the year inclusive of commodity, inflation, tariffs and logistics is around $100 million and we'll address as I mention, the balance cost and price approach by the end of the year.","Phil Ng","Got it. Okay, that's helpful color. And just given the success you've had in the pivoting Cabinets, I think if I heard you correctly, you're expecting growth or Cabinet. Your Cabinets business to track more in-line with the market. One, did I hear you correctly, I would have thought helps you outpace the market and given how strong the value side of things has been, are you planning to make an even larger pivot going forward? Thanks.","Pat Hallinan","Well, we're certainly accelerating the pivot as Chris was mentioning on both prepared remarks and some Q&A response. I think we've been surprised this year at the strength and demand of the segments to which we're pivoting as a softness and the custome and semi-custom arena. We're pivoting strongly to address both of those dynamics. We've said all along that our focus is first and foremost on driving margin improvement and growing with the market and that's still our strategy. We expect the Cabinet market to be in the low single digit this year and we expect our Cabinet business to go 1% to 2% this year, somewhat is being muted by Canada, but we feel like that's broadly in-line with the markets in which we play and we're going to be focused on margin improvement. And we signal both at the beginning of the year and on the second quarter call which we usually don't try and signal too much quarterly guidance. We knew in the middle of the year we'd be going through transitions as we ramped up new capacity in Mexico, as we brought in a new entry price point product line as a dealer channel and as we transition a big chunk of supply chain out of China and had to address some inventory build associated with that. All those dynamics are coursing through the margin in the middle of the year, it's in-line with our expectations and a business that generated first half margins around 9.3%. We'll generate back half margins in the 10.5% to 11% range and finish the year around 10% and we've guided people to think of our Cabinet progressions more half-year increments sending quarterly increments. I would say that's going to be the case not just in fiscal 2019, but even as we go through fiscal 2020.","Phil Ng","Got it. Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. First I just wanted to try and get maybe a little bit of a finer point around from a segment level what's driving some of the changes in consolidated guidance because overall, I believe when you think about the segment, top line guidance, seems like you reiterated plumbing on the top line as well as doors in Security, maybe Cabinets now of 1% to 2% maybe versus prime, maybe up 3% to 4%. Are we also to take it that in terms of just backing into the overall consolidated sales growth going down by about a point or so that in plumbing in Doors & Security that high teens growth for Doors & Security to mid-high single digits for plumbing, maybe that's skewing a little bit more to the lower end?","Pat Hallinan","Mike, there has been adjustment across all of the segment. It's a bit less-pronounced in plumbing just because plumbing competes in China and China has remained strong. But I think you're generally in the right direction. I think you should think of Cabinets for the full year in the 1% to 2% range. You have plumbing. You should have the 5.5% to 6.5% range and Doors & Security I would say you're in the 15.5% to 16.5%, maybe 17% range depending again on how some of the distribution gains play out. And that's going to get you in the 5.5% to 6.5% range for the enterprise in total, but there's no single big adjustment in one chunk of a market. I think we're acknowledging in the decking world where you have an ultra-rainy second quarter. You don't get that back and plumbing doesn't adjust as much as maybe some of the others because it has China exposure, but other than that, it's pretty much across the board.","Michael Rehaut","It's helpful. Thanks so much, Pat. I guess secondly, I just wanted to focus in on some of the investment and new distribution sign ups for the Fiberon. Just trying to get a sense, number one, what type of drag that might represent on the doors and securities segment in terms of the investment that's [ph] drag that might have been if it has had an impact on Q2 and the second half of the year and then conversely in terms of your new customer or distributor signups. How should we think about what that impact -- how that might impact the segments growth prospects for 2020?","Chris Klein","Sure, happy to address that, Mike. The Fiberon business we've owned for, I guess about 10 months now. And when we bought the business, we said, is a very solid operating company. But you know, they didn't have a strong presence at all in wholesale and didn't have a strong brand and could use some help on innovation. In the last 10 months, we've done some extraordinary things there. We've signed up a number of new distributors and really leveraging the Therma-Tru distribution system. And so it's not just -- we announced on last week, which was of significance but if you take all the new business that we've contractually signed up in the last 10 months, it ramps to over $100 million dollars incrementally. Kind of business that we bought that'll do about $200 million this year. So it's a 50% increase over the next 3 years. So it\u2019s massive. As it sits here today, we're blown away with the success we're having at Fiberon. It's a big deal.","So we're having to put more capacity and the support business out west, some business in the east, expansion of the product line. And so it had modest impact in second quarter. It'll have a little bit more impact in the second half or to start ramping a lot of this product distribution coming out of the -- into the fourth quarter, but more importantly in the 2020. And we'll give full detail of that when we give the 2020 guidance but this is not incremental and kind of interesting. This is setting up to position us as we thought all along as a really strong number 2 in the market overall. That's why we bought the business. We've had more success than we thought so I think that's kind of the general. I don't plan on giving any more detail on the incremental impact. But to the context of -- I've said all along, the best investments we make with our capital is into organic growth. And I haven't seen this kind of tremendous opportunity in organic growth in our company in a really long time. So every incremental dollar I can put into capacity in this market right now, I'm going to vector into it. And so [indiscernible] have a little bit of a drag. It's a great drag. I love it. I am usually enthusiastic if you can pick that up.","Pat Hallinan","Yes, I mean, Mike, to put it in context for the year we'll spend an incremental mid-single-digit millions but we're doing it to take a $200 million business and make it a $300 million business in the course of 3 years. And as I said, we would expect in that time frame for it to be driving and ROI margin north of 15% if not on the high side of that percentage range. So we feel like these are wise investments with short payback. We've signed up some great channel partners and we fully anticipate supporting them with capacity inventory and field resources so they can be successful.","Michael Rehaut","That's great to hear. And obviously, these types of investments that you've made in the past it played out very well. So thanks for all the detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about ad spending in plumbing and second quarter just how is fair relative to your normal cadence and how that might look in the second half relative to the current run rate?","Chris Klein","Sure, ad spending in the second quarter for plumbing? That was the question?","Pat Hallinan","Yes. I don't know but I could say the number with precision. All of our businesses have been focusing their expenses thoughtfully. And the plumbing business has been prioritizing innovation and ad spending on the hero for water campaign. We tend to be on a full year basis spending in the 10s of millions less than 50. And there was nothing about the second quarter that was higher or lower than what we typically expected throughout the course of the year.","Chris Klein","When I look at all about the hero for water campaign, is it has driven some really impressive results. Millennial and female consumers and so we will continue to invest behind that campaign and it really is moving the needle, particularly then when coupled with some of our innovation which really drive holistically to support the brand and it's required that we kind of move this thing forward.","Michael Wood","Okay. And also you talked about the direct impact that you're managing well from tariff. How are you thinking about the cumulative impact that's having on the consumer and how that might impact housing demand later this year and into next year?","Chris Klein","Sure. I think there is a limit on pricing that you can push through. And that's why we've taken a balanced approach over the last couple of years, both aggressively moving on supply chain and then incrementally taking price so that you're not overwhelming the consumer with big price increases. I think our channel partners are taking an equally measured approach. So I think effectively, we're kind of working through it. You got to balance it in terms of affordability, as well with lower interest rates. There is wage inflation that's increasing so the consumer is taking home a bit more, especially with the lower taxes. So in terms of overall affordability, those metrics look a lot better this year than they did at this time last year, and so I think, we're moving through it. I don't think this latest round is going to have us toward a tipping point. And I think for us in particular, we're going to remain very competitive, given the measured pace that we've taken on pricing.","Michael Wood","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jon Rovello from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jon Rovello","Guys, thank you for squeezing me in here. First question is, there is a lot of talk about Canada on the call today. I was curious if you see the market kind of in a similar light to what's going on in the US where some of the data on the new construction site at least in Canada seems to be improving a bit? And if you think that it's just a matter of a quarter or two before we start seeing a little bit of improvement on the R&R side. And then maybe along those same lines, if you could just help us kind of dimension the exposure you guys have to Canada in each of your segment.","Chris Klein","Yes, just on the macro part. The Canadian government, going back over a year, put in place some measures to discourage foreign investment in the housing market and really tried to suppress the bubble that they saw emerging, especially in some of the hottest markets. And it worked. So they've been very effective taking the housing market down. And so that'll eventually annualize and so we'll see some signs of improvement there. As it annualizes those actions were kind of looking at this kind of one time actions to deflate the market. So we'll live it for the balance of this year. Let that needle stabilize as it annualizes. Pat, you want to give any more.","Pat Hallinan","Yes. I mean, Jon, we have about 10% of our total enterprise exposed to Canada. That has driven 15 to slightly more than 15 in plumbing and a little bit more than 10 in cabinets. So it's really driven by cabinets and plumbing. And for plumbing, it is a big important market for us. We have a very high share in that market. Every bit as high as our US share, if not higher. And then cabinets -- we participate, particularly in new construction and particularly in the western part. And as Chris was mentioning, their housing dynamics have been flowed more with foreign buyers and natural resources in particular oil. So we don't read the Canadian market as a proxy for the US market. They have their own set of dynamics. I do think we'll start copying those much more easily by the fourth quarter of this year but I still expect them to be low growth in the fourth quarter and into next year and with a really tough in the third quarter. But I think Canada will work its way out of its housing market situation based on how it navigates foreign buyers and based on the price of oil and other natural resources. I think it's not analogous to the US.","Jon Rovello","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just one last one here. You took the top-line expectations in slightly and also the EPS expectations. I didn't hear anything on EBITDA. Was there any update there?","Pat Hallinan","It's proportional. We would have guided you to around 950 at the start of the year and 930-ish now but it's all proportional to the sales and the EPS adjustments.","Jon Rovello ","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Chris Klein","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brian Lantz, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Lantz","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Fortune Brands Home & Security quarterly investor conference call and webcast.

Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release issued earlier.

Following our prepared remarks, we have allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We delivered strong fourth quarter sales and profit, which capped off an excellent second full year as an independent company. We continue to leverage our structural competitive advantages and build on our momentum as the market for our products expands in both the new construction and repair and remodel markets. Importantly, based on our momentum and stronger performance in the early stages of this multiyear recovery, we are well positioned for continued growth over the next several years.","Let me first spend some time on the quarter highlights, then I'll comment on the momentum we have created in our first 2 years and our potential for profitable growth over the next 3 plus years. And last, I'll discuss our 2014 annual outlook for top line growth.","For the quarter, sales were up 16% and EPS was $0.38, up 65% from a year ago. Notably, our 3 housing-related segments saw total sales increase 20% versus a U.S. market that we believe was up high single digits, as we continued to gain share in our categories and benefited from the WoodCrafters acquisition.","Now, let me give you some highlights by segment. Sales for our Cabinets business were up 34% for the quarter. Importantly, even excluding WoodCrafters sales, Cabinets sales were up 18%, well ahead of the market for our products, as we grew market share in this segment. We benefited from the Cabinet remodel market that led the momentum and continued growth in new construction.","The stronger pace of R&R spending in Cabinets was a continuation of momentum we saw in the third quarter, with growth across a full range of semi-custom and custom product lines, resulting in a better mix with higher price points. We gained share in both the dealer channel, where we are the clear market leader, and in home centers, where we saw strength in our semi-custom and in-stock cabinets, as well as our bath vanity programs.","We are leveraging our structural competitive advantages, including our portfolio of brands, our leading position in the dealer channel, a continuous stream of innovation and our unique service-oriented operating platform and logistics model to generate sustainable momentum. Notably, we grew our Cabinets profits by $21 million to a total of $34 million in the quarter, nearly tripling last year's fourth quarter profit, as we successfully target profitable growth and leverage our efficient operating platform.","Plumbing sales were up 7% in the quarter, and adjusting for the comparison to last year's 53rd week, were up approximately 10%. Moen saw sales gains in both wholesale and retail in the U.S. and in China. Gains were again strongest in our U.S. wholesale business, driven by new construction demand, consumers choosing to upgrade faucet packages for their new homes and from sell-through at our new premium products, including our MotionSense hands-free faucet, which continues to be introduced with additional styles, contemporary kitchen pull-down styles in our line and steel collections and our Aris modern suite.","Moen also saw growth at retail, with our steady pace of consumer driven innovations, including MotionSense and our new Walden pullout faucet with Microban finishes. Internationally, sales in China, where there are now more than 900 Moen branded stores, were again up double digits over the prior year, driven by the expansion of our store network, the improved performance of the existing Moen stores and the expansion of our direct-to-builder effort. Retail in China continues to build our business, with a wide range of price points and with products uniquely tailored to the Chinese market.","Windows & Doors sales were up 13% for the quarter. Door products saw sales growth of 19%, with double-digit growth across all channels, driven by gains in new construction and our ongoing distribution expansion. Mix also improved especially with consumers selecting our new decorative glass designs and fiberglass door products, like our recently launched Pulse line of modern entry door styles. Window sales grew 7%, as the Window repair and remodel market momentum continued, albeit at a slower pace than our other product categories.","In the Security & Storage segment, our sales were down 2% to the prior-year quarter as expected, while operating profit grew 8%. Security sales were up 8% to the prior-year quarter, led by increases in international and safety. Master Lock U.S. retail sales continue to grow, with program expansions at large retailers. And Master Lock's rollout of new commercial electronic access control solutions designed to secure high-value sites, such as cellular telephone towers and other storage facilities, also contributed meaningfully to our sales gains. Tool Storage sales were down 16% in the fourth quarter after our 21% increase in the third quarter, as our largest customer changed its promotional cadence. Therefore, tool storage sales for the second half of 2013 were relatively flat.","So to sum up our results, we delivered another strong quarter and full year of sales and profit growth. I am excited about our performance versus a market that saw continued momentum in the repair and remodel market and some growth in the new construction. This performance demonstrates the strength of our operating model and our ability to generate profitable growth, as volume returns and we leverage our competitive advantages to gain share. I am even more excited about the strong momentum that we have built over our first 2 full years as an independent company.","Over this period, as the housing market moved into recovery, we continued to gain share and confirm the performance and potential of our operating model. For instance, over the past 2 years, we grew sales by 25% to over $4 billion. We also leveraged the strength of our leading brands and our consistent pace of consumer-focused innovation. As a result, this was disciplined profitable growth with EBITDA up 84% and EPS increasing 150%.","We further strengthened our balance sheet and began to deploy capital, as we reduced net debt-to-EBITDA to nearly 0, made our first strategic acquisition, WoodCrafters, which was immediately accretive, initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.10, which we have increased to $0.12 for 2014 and repurchased $61 million of our shares.","While we've been working hard to outperform our market over the past 2 years, we have also strengthened our organization by aligning management compensation to drive shareholder value through an increased focus on equity incentives, bringing in proven and experienced talent for key leadership roles in the operating companies and the corporate office, including a new president for our Security & Storage business and a new general counsel, and enhancing our strategy and corporate development team to help drive our next phase of growth.","So I am pleased with our accomplishments over our first 2 years. Our operating model is now even stronger and we believe that we are still in the early stages of a multi-year housing recovery. We are well positioned to leverage our structural competitive advantages to drive profitable growth in 2014 and well into the future.","Importantly, we now believe that in this next growth phase, as the market expands towards 1.5 million starts and 6% to 7% growth in R&R, we have the potential to organically grow our top line sales to approximately $6 billion, and roughly double our EPS over the next 3-plus years, with additional upside from leveraging our cash flow and balance sheet. So, let me now turn to our full year top line outlook for 2014, starting with our assumption for the market. Lee will then take you through our specific full year 2014 guidance in more detail in a few moments.","From a market perspective, we see ongoing signs of strength in the overall home products market as we enter 2014. While higher home prices and mortgage rates have slowed the pace of new construction through the fall and into the first quarter, the market for new homes is expected to show strong growth in 2014. The demand for new construction is outstripping supply in many markets across the country and developers are preparing for significant growth in 2014 and beyond. More importantly, for the repair and remodel, which is around 65% of our mix, we expect a continuation of the strong growth that we saw in the fall season. Notably, we see strength building in bigger ticket semi-custom and custom Cabinets and replacement Windows. We are also seeing increased project size and stronger demand for more premium faucets in our Moen wholesale showrooms.","These trends give us reason to be optimistic as we enter 2014 and look forward to the spring remodel season. Therefore our initial 2014 outlook is built on a fundamental assumption that the U.S. home products market grows at a combined 10% to 11% annual rate. We expect the market growth to be relatively modest in the first quarter, but then accelerate throughout the remainder of the year, especially in the second half.","Based on that U.S. housing market projection, the assumptions we make for our other markets and continued share gains, we again expect solid top line growth for 2014 with our full year sales increasing at an 11% to 13% rate over 2013, and our home products businesses growing faster and again outperforming the market.","So to sum up, we delivered strong 2013 sales and profit growth. These results capped a solid first 2 years as an independent company. We remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the recovering home products market and intend to deliver profitable growth again in 2014 and beyond. We also believe that our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our strong free cash flow by investing in our businesses, pursuing accretive strategic acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our 2014 outlook.","E. Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains, which best reflects ongoing business performance. Let me start with our fourth quarter results.","Sales were $1.1 billion, up 16% from a year ago, with our home product sales growing 20%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $97 million, up 59% or $36 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS was $0.38 for the quarter, up 65% or $0.15 versus the same quarter last year.","Now, let me provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $456 million, up $116 million or 34% over the prior-year quarter led by growth in dealers. Operating income for the segment increased to $34 million, up $21 million, as we benefited from higher sales volume and our improving mix from repair and remodel growth. Cabinet operating margin was 7.4%, 370 basis points higher than the same quarter last year. Our strategy of disciplined sales growth continues to work well, as we continue to exceed the overall Cabinet market growth, while improving profitability. For the full year, Cabinet sales increased 24% to the prior year. Operating profit tripled to $121 million, and operating margin increased 430 basis points to 7.3%.","Plumbing sales for the fourth quarter were $317 million, up $21 million or 7% versus the prior-year quarter. Excluding the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2012, segment sales increased around 10%.","Operating income was $54 million, up 28%, even as we made incremental brand investments in the U.S. And importantly, operating margin was 16.9%, 280 basis points higher than the same quarter last year. For the full year, Plumbing sales increased 17%, operating profit was up 36% to the prior year and operating margin increased 250 basis points to 17.8%.","Windows & Door sales were $176 million, up $20 million or 13% from the prior-year quarter. Within this segment, the Door business experienced 19% sales growth, while the Windows business grew 7%. Operating profit for this segment increased to $5 million, up 18% to prior year. For the full year, Windows & Doors sales increased 12%, operating profit more than tripled from the prior year and operating margin increased 170 basis points to 2.4%.","Security & Storage sales were $153 million in the fourth quarter, down 2% to the prior-year quarter. Security sales were strong and increased 8%. As expected, sales of tool storage products were down 16%, as the largest customer changed its promotional cadence. Segment operating income increased 8% to $22 million, driven by a combination of sales gains in Security products and cost reductions from changes to our benefit structure.","So, to sum up consolidated fourth quarter performance, we continued to leverage our structural competitive advantages to drive share gains, and we're continuing to see better mix driven by the improving repair and remodel market.","Turning to the balance sheet. We exit 2013 with a strong balance sheet. Even as we completed the $300 million WoodCrafters acquisition, repurchased $52 million of our shares and initiated a quarterly dividend during the year. As of year end, cash was $241 million and debt was $356 million, resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA of 0.2x. We also announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend beginning in 2014, while maintaining a payout ratio under 30%.","Turning to the growth potential of our business over the next 3-plus years. As Chris mentioned, we've booked strong momentum over the past 2 years. We believe we're in the early stages of a multi-year recovery and now have the potential to drive even higher levels of sales and profit over the next phase of our growth. More specifically, based on the market assumptions over the next 3-plus years, we believe that we have the potential to grow sales to approximately $6 billion, EBITDA to more than $900 million, operating margins to 14-plus percent and EPS to over $3, with additional upside from using our cash flow and balance sheet.","Based on our view of the market and our own potential growth over the next 3-plus years, we're beginning to invest in additional capacity and infrastructure throughout our business. This is reflected in both our EPS and capital expenditure guidance for 2014. We also believe that we can deploy our cash and balance sheet over the same period to increase this growth through a combination of strategic acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders.","Turning to the details of our outlook for 2014. As discussed previously, our approach to the annual outlook begins with a market assumption, but also includes continued share gains in addition to the overall market growth. As Chris mentioned, based on our projected 10% to 11% U.S. home products market growth, the assumptions we make for our other markets and continued share gains, we now expect our full year 2014 sales to increase 11% to 13% compared to 2013.","As we consider timing of growth in 2014, we expect market growth to be lowest in the first quarter and then accelerate throughout the year. Our resulting expectations for full year 2014 EPS are now in the range of $1.91 to $2.01. The midpoint of our guidance represents an increase of 31% over 2013 EPS of $1.50.","We expect 2014 free cash flow to be at least $250 million for the full year, after CapEx of approximately $130 million to $140 million, as we begin to invest in the incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential to approximately $6 billion over the next 3-plus years.","In summary, our business model is performing well. We are pleased with our strong 2013 results and our performance over the past 2 years. This past performance and the continued market recovery gives us confidence for 2014 growth, but also for potential growth beyond 2014, as we continue to benefit from our structural competitive advantages in the recovering market. Importantly, this stable momentum in both the housing market and in our business performance, should allow us to create incremental shareholder value by making select acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks in the fourth quarter of 2013 and full year 2014 guidance. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","First question, Chris, I guess when you and the team are thinking about setting the targets for '14 and realizing kind of some moving pieces between new construction and home improvement, where you came out, do you feel like that's a scenario that the market is already geared to grow 10% to 11%, and absent economic shock, you feel good about that? Or do you think you have to see a reacceleration some of these metrics to get there? I guess any type of thought that goes behind how you guys were thinking about it.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I'd say I've been doing this for 5, 6 years and through a lot of different conditions. And I think what was unique this year is obviously a bit of a slowdown fourth quarter and we think into the first quarter. But on the other side, we see very strong fundamentals driving toward a strong balance of the year, strong spring selling season coming through a strong second half. And so it is a little bit of on faith that you're saying the fundamentals look good. We obviously run a lot of analytics around it, but anecdotally and through talking with all of our channels, as well as looking at the data, we felt good about it. I'd say the expectation would probably be softer first quarter and then seeing it ramp through. Some of our products are lagging a bit as they come in later in the building stage. To counter that on the R&R side, it doesn't take a lot of faith, because we saw a lot of momentum continuing in the fourth quarter. We talked about on our last call, third quarter momentum. Man, fourth quarter kept coming and that's unique. I mean, usually you'd see by the middle of November things kind of grinded off and our Cabinet business, especially on the dealers side, saw that momentum keep coming. And so with that side of the market, we feel really solid on. So that's kind of the pieces as they roll together. So I'd say we feel good about a 10% to 11% market projection.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then, as you talk about that first quarter slowdown relative to the fourth quarter, can you maybe frame that a little bit, just for expectations, what type of deceleration you're seeing, and maybe which businesses you're going to expect that the most?","Christopher J. Klein","I'd say, again, I'll go back on the R&R side, things look pretty good. So, I'd say it's continuing to move. The new construction is going to lag a little bit, so I don't know the magnitude of it yet. But what was healthy actually was, as we move in to December, we saw some inventory positions coming down at Moen, and so we don't mind that because it takes out -- there's not excess inventory out in the market, they'll order to demand. So that looked pretty good. So I'd say, it really is more new construction. And new construction starts to ramp up again, that will help us second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter. But R&R's continuing, so it's hard to balance those 2 precisely.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Wetenhall from RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask, you're updating your 3-year outlook to $6 billion top line, if I heard that correctly, $900 million of EBITDA, 14% operating margin and $3 of EPS. So, I just want to understand, in terms of visibility and confidence level, what's giving you the confidence to put that into the marketplace?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I guess we start with, we don't run our business quarter-to-quarterly, we run it over a 3-plus-year horizon. And really, as we started talking to investors when we became an independent company 2.5 years ago, we said, through our big restructuring, we have reserved capacity up to about $5 billion in sales kind of across all of our businesses. Well, as we exit the year and look into the next couple of years, we're going to hit that $5 billion in about 18 months. And so internally, we started planning in the fall for where we can expand some of our facilities, where we're going to add some production lines, where we're putting in some enabling technology. And really, those investments are supported by the longer-term outlook $6 billion and beyond. So we thought it'd be helpful to talk to investors today about that and say based on the trajectory that we see, a market returning to at least 1.5 million housing starts over that period. An R&R market that now looks like it's got good legs underneath it running 6% to 7%. We can see our way to $6 billion over the next 3-year horizon and given that, we're going to make some investments to support that so that we're ready and we can maintain our service levels to support that whole expansion. So it felt like a natural extension of kind of what we've been talking about. We've been very candid about our plans and our business is operating. And I could tell you, we have a ton of confidence coming out of the last 2 years. This unfolded really as well as or even slightly better than what we thought it would. And so we got the confidence to invest behind our operating platforms and really take the growth and continue to grow share.","E. Lee Wyatt","Bob, we're not technically calling that guidance, we're trying to give you a sense of our potential over the next 3 years as we invest as Chris said. So, more of just potential view of our potential over the next 3-plus years.","Christopher J. Klein","And really, it's to support, as we start talking about investments, as we call out, we're going to make some capital investments and make some expense investments this year, next year. It's to give you a sense of why we're making those investments, well, it's because we're seeing that longer-term growth out there.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's really what I was looking for. And Lee, thanks for the clarification. Just as a follow on, it seems like you guys are going to generate pretty substantial amounts of free cash flow. You touched on leveraging the balance sheet and free cash flow. Is -- from a capital allocation standpoint, any color on whether M&A will be the path where you want to go down, do share buybacks or dividends, would be helpful.","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. I think we've been consistent in what we've been talking about. We would like to expand the business and accelerate our strategies through some M&A activity, but we'll be disciplined around that. We'll look to grow in adjacent markets. We'll look to grow internationally. We'll look at categories that are close to what we do. To the extent we find good opportunities, we'll be enthusiastic about that. To the extent we don't, we'll be pretty disciplined in returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and through increasing the dividend. As I highlighted earlier, we're also investing in the business. So that will be a part of what we're doing too, because we see some terrific organic growth opportunities inside the business today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, when you talk about capital spend in preparation for what could be a 3-year growth trajectory, could you rank order where that spending's occurring? And what needs the most investment?","Christopher J. Klein","It's primarily going to be in Cabinets and in faucets, so, obviously, our 2 biggest businesses. If you look at our Cabinets business, we've got a distributed network. Some of this expansion will be expanding existing sites, might be building adjacent to sites. So we're leveraging the nucleus of what we've got in terms of management and resources in that market, but we can add blinds, we can add some capacity that way and we're looking at it across all North Americans saying where it makes sense to put in, to service the demand that we see out there. We're just seeing some great demand coming through, especially on the R&R side. On the faucet side, we've got a -- kind of a global supply chain. We do assembly in both China and in North Carolina and so we're looking at an assembly capacity there. Make sure we've got enough capacity to handle the demand that keeps coming there and expanding all that out. And both of these aren't just up to 2016. These are looking at inflection point as we reach $5 billion in revenue how we're going to build the capacity to handle the next 5-plus years and do it in a disciplined way so you see it kind of feather in over time. We're just calling out that we're starting that activity in anticipation of in 18 months that we'd be hitting that $5 billion level.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my other question I'm going to wrap a couple in here if I could. One, could you split out this past quarter when you talked about growth, what type of growth you were seeing in R&R versus new construction? And then when I look at your segment margins, your incremental margins, you had a very strong plumbing and a bit weaker than what we expected on the Cabinets side. Could you address those? And then what you think the incremental op margin for 2014 is?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. I think if you look at the split on new construction and R&R, we won't break it out explicitly, but it was a little stronger contribution on the R&R side. New construction was solid, but fourth quarter, it trailed off a bit and I think that's continuing in the first quarter. So more of a contribution coming out of R&R, which to be candid, was quite robust on the -- especially on the Cabinet side coming through the dealer market and showrooms for Moen, so quite strong there. On the Cabinets side, I'm not sure. We were thrilled with the growth that we saw on the Cabinet side of the market, sales up 34%, 18% without WoodCrafters there. And that was very high-quality growth. Obviously tripling profits in the quarter, strong margins coming through, great mix. So we're seeing some pretty strong mix in bigger packages, bigger remodel programs coming through especially on the dealer side. So we thought that was both strong fourth quarter growth, as well as a good indicator of what we could expect in 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the question of the capacity additions. Can you give us a sense, Chris or Lee, what you think the cost associated with any of these capacity additions might be that we might see in 2014? And sort of like when we might see some of those show up?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, Stephen, the -- when you look at the capacity investments, they come in 2 flavors really. There's a P&L impact and then there's a capital expenditure. So we called out capital expenditures of $130 million to $140 million in the year. And those will happen throughout the year, candidly. If you look at the capital expenditures in 2013, gross was around $97 million. So we're up $30 million to $40 million. And as we look to the long term on CapEx, I'd say DNA is about $90 million to $100 million. So we've been below that. We caught up in '13 at $97 million. I think you could see for us a couple of years be over through the $130 million to $140 million, and I think then we'll settle back in long-term at kind of that DNA level. So you'll get a little bit of an acceleration for 2 years, but it's not that significant. In terms of the P&L impact embedded in our '14 guidance for earnings per share, we think it's probably at least $0.08 of incremental investment on the P&L side on this. Again, the biggest piece of those in Cabinets and Moen, as Chris said. And you'll see those start in the first quarter. So they'll be spread as a couple of cents a quarter spread throughout the year. Moen's got -- we have a disciplined analytical process of doing this, so we review and we approve each project and we have very high returns on the projects we accrue.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, great, that's helpful. And then with respect to deploying capital. Obviously, one of the things that you've been talking about for quite a while has been the opportunity in M&A. And yet, we all have seen that the overall deal activity on the public markets have been pretty strong. And I was wondering if maybe, Chris or Lee, you could comment on how the conversations may have changed here or how they've been changing over the last 3 to -- let's say, 3 to 6 months. As you talk to potential candidates to -- for acquisition. Are they finding that, because we had a little bit of a pullback in the housing start environment, that maybe now is not the right time, they want to -- they're waiting for a stronger market or is the decision-making process completely unrelated to that? I mean, is it completely related to sort of personal issues and things like that? Can you just help us understand how the situation maybe changing there?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure, it's all of the above. So, I think that you're going to have situations where some owners, investors, will want to take advantage of the public market, situations where they would prefer a private sale. There are some family-owned businesses that this is a longer-term discussion over a long period of time, it's not a moment in time. And so their deliberations are going to be longer. And so this discussion will be, is this a better time now than it would have been 4 or 5 years ago, not, is it a better time now relative to a quarter ago. So that's why I say it's all of the above. We view it kind of over the next couple of years. And so things unfold as they unfold and we'll be deliberate about it. The important thing is we're active. We've got a strong team there. We're involved. And I think things will unfold. We're delighted to have the opportunity to acquire WoodCrafters. We're hopeful that over the next 12, 24 months there'll be other opportunities similar to that. And so we're active in discussions on that. So I'd say it's not a knee-jerk relative to a changing market, but these things are often fairly complex.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In the past, during your third year, you did talk about trying to manage your portfolio to certain metrics. And I believe Windows was one of the businesses that did not jump out as being a top performer. Can you update us on your thinking about your willingness to swing your portfolio given the industry structure in Windows, as you're entering your third public year?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. Yes, what was described in the past is that the Window market has evolved a bit slower than some of the other markets going back to the energy tax credit, 2009, 2010. We still do think it pulled some demand into those periods, but it also delayed some of the rationalization in the industry. Every other building product industry was going through some dramatic restructuring, but there was volume that was keeping that industry, that part of the industry, from going through that restructuring. So it's lagged, and I'd say continues to lag. But in the second half of the year, we did see improvements. We saw revenue growth coming on. We saw a little bit better mix coming through. So we're obviously watching it very carefully. It's not performing as strongly as our other R&R businesses, but it is performing well -- better. So we'll see how it unfolds. And if it continues to build momentum, it'll be in a very good spot. If it's not building the kind of momentum that we'd like, then we'll evaluate things.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","All right. It's a little late. I guess in Cabinets, Lee, you talked about disciplined growth relative to capital expenditures in margins. Could you talk about different growth rates you might be seeing by channel, what that means for utilization rates as it relates to how you deal with each of the 3 broad demand areas? And did you guys really kind of pass up a lot of business, because you didn't want to move towards lower margin business? If you could you could give us a sense of how capital spending is affecting those different demand rates?","E. Lee Wyatt","We basically look at our businesses and we are the leaders in our industry. And we don't -- we're going to grow, we have strategic advantages that we can use to drive sales and we don't have the chase kind of low margin sales. And we've been very disciplined. You saw that on the Cabinet business with the promotions that were out there for a couple of years. And same thing on the Plumbing side. Moen is the leader in the industry, and we don't need to chase those things. So I would say, we do that without thinking initially about the capital investments. We think those are very good businesses. They're both growing significantly. They're taking share in a significant way and they're growing their operating margins. As we think of capital, we put capital into those 2 ahead of everything, but we invest in all of our businesses. So we're not really having to make what I would call restricted capital investments. Those businesses are growing very well. They're very strong and they're just -- we're starting to see over the first 2 years you're seeing the benefits of those leadership positions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question I had was on the guidance. And just trying to understand a little bit better in terms of the timing of things and the components. Is it fair to say that when you think about the underlying -- kind of more than 2 questions in here, so apologies. But in terms of the 10%, 11% U.S. home products market, I assume that's being driven more by repair and remodel, perhaps an outlook for up high single digits? And as you think about the complexion of the year and you said that you expect things to be a little slower in the first quarter and accelerate. I would have actually thought the opposite given that the comps get tougher throughout, the year ago comps get tougher as you work through the year, particularly as they picked up in 2Q and 3Q. So just, a, about the end market growth composition; and, b, just any thoughts around why you're thinking that things will be slower in the first half, given that the comps actually just get tougher in the back half?","Christopher J. Klein","So a couple of questions in there. First on market assumption. 10% to 11% would imply new construction up high teens, R&R roughly in the 7% range. And so -- and I'd say that new construction really, for us, kicking in the second quarter and then accelerating even more so in the second half. So that's the first point I think you're looking for in terms of guidance on. The second piece is on comps. We actually had a very strong first quarter last year. So across the business if you look at our first quarter Moen is outstanding, across and other parts of the business. So they're -- I wouldn't say necessarily that kind of weaker comps in the earlier part of the year. Obviously, it performed well, but as we look at growth with a 10% to 11% market growth and we look at share gains on top of that, I think you just roll that through the different businesses, I think you're going to see some pretty strong growth numbers and profit conversion really kind of for the second quarter through the balance of the year.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. I guess just, second, just turning to the margins in a couple of the segments. Plumbing had -- whereas in the first 3 quarters of the year, Plumbing was working on an incremental margin of 30% to 35%, roughly. Really kicked up well above 50% in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering about any particular drivers in 4Q that may have been responsible for that? And similarly in Windows & Doors, not much of an incremental margin at all in Windows & Doors for the 4Q, whereas it was maybe a little stronger earlier in the year.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. You look at Moen first, they had a very high incremental margin in the fourth quarter. I think some of that is just timing. For the full year, they were 32% incremental margin. That's a much better rate for them. So I think I wouldn't project that same 50-plus percent incremental margin going forward. They finished the year really with total operating margin up 250 basis points to 17.8% on 17% growth. So a very strong year with 32% incremental margin. That's -- I think that's the way to think about the business more. In terms of Windows & Doors, we saw -- we did see a low incremental operating margin in the quarter. We see higher in Doors and as the volumes coming in, in Windows, it's about how do you leverage that, the labor component of that and efficiencies. For the full year, we saw Doors up 21%, their incremental margin was 21% and 16% for the full year. So Doors doing really well, Windows a little more constrained.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask on free cash flow guidance. In light of the earnings guidance and even accounting for the increased CapEx here, it seems a bit conservative to think that you'll only be, I guess it's $250-plus million. But could you kind of walk through what are some of the puts and takes in there?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, when you kind of compare it to say 2012 when we had $326 million of free cash flow and we're at $254 million, there are issues around between the 2 years. We have less option proceeds. For example, in 2012, we had $104 million of option proceeds. In 2013, we had about $51 million. And in 2014, we'll have, we think about $20 million. So that's declining somewhat. CapEx, for example, in 2012 net was about $62 million, in 2013, was about $95 million, and it'll be $130 million to $140 million. So the other piece of that is the CapEx because we report free cash flow after CapEx. And we're always -- we always start the year on our free cash flow guidance to be $250 million-plus or so and then we will modify it as we see during the year. But $250 million plus feels pretty good right now and we're continuing to invest in the business.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then second question, if we look at the Storage side of the business, can you talk about how -- you had a pull forward or timing issues in 3Q than 4Q. Can you talk about how the sell-through was in 4Q and I guess where the inventories stand in that business today?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, so we talked a little bit in the third quarter about them pulling forward some demands, some orders into the third quarter. We then look at the fourth quarter and they altered some of their promotional activities, so moved some of that, actually into the first quarter this year. So, the inventories are getting absorbed into the market. I think we're going to end up looking at it kind of almost on a rolling 6-month basis. If you look at the prior 6 months, they're down a couple of percent, which is about what we would expect, with strong profit and cash generation I think if we look at the next rolling 6 months, we'll likely see a similar kind of story. So, it's what we would expect as we've described. It's a business that we're managing to modest growth expectation, but we're trying to continue to invigorate the product line. It's a profitable business for us, generates strong cash flow. So, it's kind of - as expected is the way I describe it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","It's about pricing in Cabinets in the quarter. I didn't see it called out specifically. How is the promotional environment? Did you get pricing? Or was pricing needed in the fourth quarter? And how are you thinking about pricing in 2014 plus promotional activity in the context of still a pretty challenging raw material environment?","Christopher J. Klein","So a couple of things in there. First, overall we'd say the mix continues to improve so we're getting a combination of price, which we take through the whole product line every year, as well as our mix, kind of average dollar per box within product lines continues to improve. And that's really demand driven; that's consumers selecting higher quality product, buying our new product, our new finishes coming through. In terms of price versus inflation, we're seeing a little bit of inflation on hardwoods and on particleboard and plywood, but we can recover that through some pricing. So it feels pretty healthy. On the promotional side of the market, that's been really a home center phenomena. I'd say that it is really much, much, much improved relative to where we've been over the last couple of years. We've been particularly disciplined there, really emphasizing our products, our service side of the business and working closely with associates to really match consumer demand to the best product within our portfolio. So all that has paid off. And I think we've continued to grow and gain share without having to discount. But I think that the industry in general, now that capacity is coming -- is being utilized and real demand is coming into the industry, the need for that promotional activity has abated. So, I'd say it's a healthy pricing environment, and it feels like it's really the byproduct of demand and capacity being better matched.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And just one more question on -- clarification on the deep sense of incremental investment in 2014. Is that embedded in your EPS guidance?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, it is. It's in the 2014 guidance already.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","It's probably [indiscernible] to discuss some credit issues with distributors in China not having access to financing. Curious if that, at all, is impacting your retail operations there? And could you give us some update on the store count?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. Starting with the store count, we're up over 900, we're about 910 as we closed the year. That was a combination of adding stores and we also pared back some lower performing locations. We're really focused on driving more incremental volume -- incremental margin through some of those stores. So it's a combination of both those things. On the credit side, we haven't. I'd say we're -- a lot of the relationships we've had, we've had for a long time we're close to a lot of the wholesalers. So I'd like to think we're very much on top of that and really haven't seen any of that issue coming through.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Great. And also, is there any substantial or material margin differential between Plumbing Products that you sell into remodeling versus new construction? And how that may have impacted fourth quarter?","Christopher J. Klein","It can be -- it's a complicated answer. So on the repair and remodel side, the answer is it depends. We certainly sell some lower price, lower margin product through some channels that consumers will buy at. As they move up into dealer showrooms into some of our wholesale showrooms, they're buying some pretty high margin products. So that's why it kind of depends on that mix. We're certainly seeing that mix improve, consumers are opting for a richer mix in our spending. On the new construction side, same phenomena. I mean, you've got a base grade product that's going into new construction and that was really your bread-and-butter 2010, 2011. But that mix has continued to improve in 2012 and 2013. So the general trend is toward improving mix into improving price points really across both repair, remodel and across new construction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","So I'm wondering if you can make any comments on the cadence of sales in the new construction throughout the quarter and to date. And I'm really trying to understand when things start to get a bit slower and whether or not there's been any incremental improvement?","Christopher J. Klein","So we kind of lagged at least a quarter relative to new construction if you think about our products, faucets, showers, sinks, entry doors, cabinets coming into a home, they're coming in within the closing phase of the construction build. So we still had a lot of volumes flowing through in the third quarter really completing homes that had been started earlier in the year. We started to see some slowdown really it was in the last 6 weeks or so and some of that might have been as well inventory coming out and fulfilling demand against inventory that was in the channel. We'd expect that will still be the same phenomena in the first quarter, and even as then new construction picks up and they start to see starts pickup in the late first quarter, we'll lag some of that unless our channels get out ahead and feel like they don't have enough volume and at which point they'll start ordering in anticipation of that. So that's a little bit of the dynamic, it was as expected. So I'd say it's we can kind of see it coming if we look out a quarter or 2. But the positive is obviously on the repair, remodel side of the market. That has been very strong and very consistent. We don't have that kind of a pattern. So that's kind of an offset to what we see on the new construction side.","Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Sure, that's helpful. And then kind of as a follow-up to that, what does give you more confidence that things are going to be picking back up in the second half?","Christopher J. Klein","I think it's a number of things. So I think if you look at the builder activity, going back over the last 9 months, they've certainly been more active in acquiring land in community development in their traffic. And so all of those things point for them, I think, toward a strong year and that season really is just starting to kick off. And so I think we'll have harder data on that obviously a quarter from now when we're talking again. But it's also the macro. We're still well under constructing what we need to actually house all the household formations and we demolish a couple of hundred thousand houses in the country every year due to storm damage or just dilapidation. So you just roll the macro numbers together and we're still well under the volume of housing that we need to build over the next 3 years. So we look at the year-end factors and we look at the macro factors and we roll that together and we probably rerun all those calculations at least once a week, especially in this planning period. So I'd say we're very comfortable with our outlook as we put it forward today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Chan from Baird.","Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm just wondering about what you're seeing out there in the price versus commodity cost environment, as well as what's assumed in the guidance for 2014?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, when we look at fourth quarter of '13 and really for the year, I'd characterize our inflation as kind of low-single digits. The only thing that was really above that was wood, plywood, particleboard was in the mid-single-digit range. But in total, kind of low-single digits. And then with our normal pricing increases it basically was. So there was a nominal effect net of price. But you we also saw mix improve so much, in both new construction and R&R that, that really dwarfs the entire pricing. As you think about '14 guidance, it's a little similar. We see slightly higher inflation, call it low-single digits again, but slightly higher than '13. And then we'll have price increases that will offset that. And it will continue through our innovation, we get indirect pricing through our innovation in our mix as it continues to improve.","Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I can ask about the Security business. You talk about expansion to the commercial access market. Is there a way for you to sort of size what kind of opportunity you see, as you continue to expand that business forward?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. We had a strong quarter in Security, up 8% across within that. Commercial was up mid-single digits. We see opportunities there to leverage our distribution. That market for us with Master Lock, 1\/2 of that market is commercial and the other half is retail. Obviously, a very well-known brand in retail. But the commercial side is, I'd describe it as quietly strong. And so we see opportunities on the electronics side. We're investing in our own organic capabilities and we're also looking at opportunities to supplement that product line potentially with some acquisitions there as well. So strong on the commercial side and Safety as a subset of that, so we've got a line of products that help secure manufacturing sites, mining sites. And that was also up strong in the quarter. So it's a little bit of a dynamic rolling through the commercial side of the market.","Operator","This concludes our Q&A session.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks everyone for joining us today. In the first quarter, our teams delivered profit growth that was right on plan despite home products market that is, as we expected, off to a slow start. Importantly, our mix continues to improve, our core businesses are performing well and we\u2019re building momentum in the market.","In the second quarter, our plan anticipates some marketing improvement and we are watching closely as the quarter unfolds in this important spring selling season. We also continue to anticipate improving new construction activity in the second half of the year. Therefore, based on that market assumption and solid execution of our plan in the first quarter, we are maintaining our full year outlook for existing business.","We also recently announced an agreement to acquire Norcraft, a leading cabinet producer. This should contribute additional growth this year and into the future as we expect our markets to continue to improve well beyond 2015.","Let me first spend some time on our outlook for the home products market, then, I\u2019ll provide my perspective on our underlying business performance, and last, I\u2019ll update you on our strategy to drive incremental growth with our cash and balance sheet.","Starting with our view on the US home products market. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to see signs of accelerating strength across many aspects of the market that pointed to a stronger 2015. From a facing [ph] perspective, it was clear that due primarily to the timing of housing starts, the market for our products would likely build momentum through the year, particularly in the second half as our products go into homes in the later stages of the construction.","Importantly, the first quarter market for our home products grew as we expected it would. We estimate total growth was around 5.5%, with repair and remodel growing approximately 5%, and new construction growing 6% to 7%. In April, we have started to see more positive signs in order patterns and we enter the second quarter with modest channel inventory levels. This profile supports our view of the gradual acceleration in the second quarter, which should lead us to a stronger second half.","Our 2015 annual outlook continues to rebuild under the assumption that the US home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 8% rate. Within that overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at a 4% to 5% rate. New home construction, where our products are installed in the later stages of the building cycle, is assumed to grow low-double digits over 2014.","Based on that US home products market projection, the assumptions we make for our other markets, continued share gains, plus the SentrySafe acquisition, we continue to expect solid topline growth for 2015 with our full year sales increasing 9% to 10.5% over 2014 and our home products businesses again outperforming the market for our products.","Additionally, given that our products are in later stage in new construction, we expect that this growth will skew much more to the second half, with some improvement in the second quarter. With this market and sales growth, our teams achieved our first quarter plan and are focused on delivering full year EPS of $2 to $2.10.","Now, let me provide some perspective on our business performance, starting with our cabinet segment. We continue to follow the same disciplined strategy for cabinets with a goal being the best cabinet supplier in North America. At the center of this strategy is our dedication to the designer as the key customer and are focused on the most attractive segments of the market.","The largest segment on the cabinet market is the dealer channel, which services more than half of the semi-custom cabinet market. We have built long-term structural competitive advantages that allows to grow together with our dealer partners, including a regional supply chain for optimal service, multiple brands to avoid channel conflict, the industry\u2019s best sale and service team, and a consistent flow of consumer-focused innovation.","We recently announced agreement to acquire Norcraft cabinets, which fits perfectly into our strategy. Norcraft can help us build on our structural competitive advantages with their prudent capabilities, great relationships in the dealer channel, and strong operating management throughout their business. Combination will strengthen our overall product offering, round out our regional market penetration, and enhance our frameless capabilities.","With long overlap in our dealer channel customer bases, we see tremendous opportunity for accelerated growth by bringing these businesses together. Over the past several years, our cabinet team has had substantial success selling multiple product lines into our dealers. We intend to replicate that success with the Norcraft unit base by adding our product lines to their portfolio. Likewise, we also have the opportunity to leverage Norcraft products into our dealer network. We believe that in a few years, this business could add more than $450 million in revenue and $0.20 of EPS annually.","Regarding the status of the transaction, our tender offer is open, we have received antitrust clearance and we expect to close by the end of the second quarter.","In the first quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 1% over the prior year quarter, excluding the impact of currency. Importantly, sales on our largest channel, dealers, grew 8%. Our share gains in this key channel are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers as well as new dealerships. Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanity were down 9% due to the impact of a timing shift in shipments into the second quarter as customers drew down inventory and preparation for a second quarter launch of updated product. We expect the first quarter impact will be more than offset with greater growth in the coming quarters.","Our home center semi-custom cabinet sales were relatively flat in the quarter. In 2014, we made investments in this part of our business and have seen success. As we enter 2015, we continued working with our customers to reshape the category and simplify the consumer shopping experience. The first quarter was impacted by competitive promotion activity, but we remain disciplined and focused on our strategy to partner with our customers to help them reshape the category long-term through investments that help drive consumer behavior.","Our builder direct business, where we are appropriately disciplined, was up slightly in the quarter, reflecting the pace of new construction. Overall for cabinets, our teams continue to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our structural competitive advantages have been built over a long period of time and are tough to replicate. The impact at this consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix, and our improving margins.","For our plumbing segment, excluding the impact of currency, sales were up 9% for the quarter, led by growth in US wholesale and retail as well as in Canada. In the first quarter of 2015, our sales grew broadly, mix was solid, and margins were strong. Importantly, wholesale sales increased 9% even as wholesalers order slightly below POS and channel inventories contracted somewhat.","We\u2019re encouraged to see consumers continue to select our innovative new faucet products for their new homes and repair and remodel projects, including new pull-out and pull-down faucets with reflex self-retraction in our Brookshire, Hensley, and Etch lines, our Align modern suite, and our Oxby and Rizen bath faucets. Excluding the impact of currency, international sales increased low-double digits, driven by growth in Canada, partially offset by softer sales in China.","China sales declined slightly versus the prior year due to slower direct-to-builder activity. However, our nearly 1,000 Moen stores generated solid high-single digit growth as we continue to focus our marketing efforts at the local city level and increased store network productivity. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential.","Doors reported sales were up 5% for the quarter. Door products saw sales growth driven by gains in both new construction and retail. Mix continue to improve with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and responding to our new styles like our recently launched Pulse line of modern entry doors. The furniture brand continues to perform strongly across all channels.","In the security segment, sales increased 41% from the prior year quarter, excluding the impact of currency. Sales from the SentrySafe acquisition drove the growth. The teams are working hard to integrate the operation and we\u2019re excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years.","So, to sum up the quarter, the US home products market started the year slow as we expected. Not surprisingly, our teams executed well, and our profit results were on plan.","Finally, I\u2019d like to comment on our efforts to use our cash flow and balance sheet to drive incremental long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions and purchase our shares and increase our dividend. We have begun to build significant momentum and we are laying the foundation for incremental value creation at an accelerated base.","During the first three years of the housing recovery through 2014, we deployed over $1.1 billion. We have made $450 million in acquisitions, repurchased $500 million of our shares and declared approximately $200 million in dividends, laying the ground work for incremental long-term shareholder value. Importantly, looking forward over the next three to four years, we believe we have the potential to deploy an additional $2 billion to $2.5 billion to drive even more growth and shareholder value. The potential $600 million Norcraft acquisition is just the first step in this next phase.","I'm also excited that Nick Fink is joining Fortune Brands in our newly created role of Senior Vice President of Global Growth and Development. Nick is a results oriented leader with strengths in international markets, industry leading consumer brands and successful M&A transactions. He\u2019s also very familiar with our businesses and I worked closely with him for several years when Bean and Fortune Brands were one company. I have confidence in his abilities and approach to business. Nick is a great fit to help us accelerate our global growth strategy and enhance our ability to complete value creating mergers and acquisitions.","So to sum up, 2015 is developing as we expected. We remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the recurring home products market, our core businesses are strong and we remain well-positioned to deliver solid growth in 2015. More importantly, we have laid the foundation for even more growth beyond 2015 as the housing market continues its recovery. We also continue to believe that our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our strong free cash flow.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Lee who will review our financial performance.","Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, a majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our first quarter results. Sales were $951 million, up 7% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 8%. As we discussed in February, when providing 2015 annual guidance, the first quarter was expected to have modest growth with increasing growth in the second quarter and the highest growth in the second half of 2015.","Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $73.2 million, up 4% or $3 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.28 for the quarter versus $0.27 the same quarter last year. Our EPS was on plan and supports the full year guidance provided in February.","Now, let me provide more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $411 million, flat to the prior year quarter. Dealer sales were $168 million, an increase of 8% from the prior year. Home center in-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $104 million declined 9%, due to the timing shift of shipments to support incremental product placements as Chris described.","Home center semi-custom sales were $79 million, builder-direct shipments of $22 million and Canadian sales of $37 million were relatively flat in the quarter. Currency reduced Canadian sales by $4 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the shift in timing of in-stock cabinets and vanities from the first quarter to the second quarter and currency, cabinet sales increased 4%.","Operating income for the cabinet segment decreased 6% or $6 million over the prior year quarter, due primarily to inefficiencies related to 2014 capacity expansion actions. As we discussed on our February call, these inefficiencies should now be behind us. We expect operating income to accelerate throughout the year and add approximately 100 basis points to the prior year operating margin.","Turning to plumbing, sales for the first quarter were $334 million, up $24 million or 8% led by US wholesale of 9% and Canada of 8%. Excluding the negative impact of currency, total sales increased 9%. Operating income increased $10 million to $65 million, up 17%. Operating margin for the segment was 19.5%, up 160 basis points from the prior year quarter. Door sales were $83 million, up $3 million or 5% from the prior year quarter. Operating loss for this segment was $1 million, reflecting investments to support business growth.","Additionally, the first quarter of 2014 included a $1 million benefit from a bad debt reserve adjustment. Operating profit for this segment should accelerate throughout the year and significantly exceed prior year. Security sales, which now includes SentrySafe were $123 million in the first quarter, up 39% to the prior year quarter. Excluding the negative impact of currency, sales increased 41%. Segment operating income increased 8% to $10 million.","To sum up consolidated first quarter performance, sales increased 7% and EPS were on plan at $0.28. Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening US dollar reduced our total first quarter sales by approximately 1.5%, with Canada being the primary source. The EPS impact was approximately $0.01.","Turning to the balance sheet, our March 31 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $179 million, debt of 760 million and our net debt to EBITDA leverage is 1.1 times. We have $235 million drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility, as the first quarter is seasonally the highest cash usage quarter.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2015, as Chris mentioned, based on our projected 6% to 8% US home products market growth, the assumptions we make for our other markets and continued share gains, plus the SentrySafe acquisition, we expect full-year 2015 sales to increase 9% to 10.5% compared to 2014. We expect that this growth will skew much more to the second half, with some improvement in the second quarter. We reduced our previous guidance of 9% to 11% full-year growth due to the expected impact of currency movements.","We are maintaining our outlook for 2015 EPS, which calls for EPS in the range of $2 to $2.10. We expect 2015 free cash flow to be around $250 million after expected CapEx of 130 million. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions. Interest expense of $15 million, a tax rate of 32.5% and average fully diluted shares of approximately 163 million. Our updated outlook does not include any benefit from the Norcraft acquisition. Depending on the closing date, Norcraft could generate sales of $210 million to $230 million and EPS of $0.03 to $0.05 in 2015, net of amortization, interest expense and taxes.","For the full-year 2016, sales could be $400 million to $425 million with EPS of $0.10 to $0.15. Longer term, sales could go to over $450 million with EPS of at least $0.20. We are excited about the value that can be created through the Norcraft west acquisition. The purchase price is $25.50 per share with a purchase price multiple of approximately 11.5 times 2014 reported EBITDA, which should effectively decline to under eight times with synergies in the next few years. The transaction will be initially financed under our existing credit facility.","In summary, the first quarter of 2015 was on plan in a market experiencing modest growth. The solid performance of our core business, the recent investments made to increase capacity and steps taken to reposition our portfolio for stronger growth as well as the expected continuing market recovery give us confidence in continued solid growth in the coming years. As demonstrated by the Norcraft acquisition, we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. We are well positioned as we focus on maximizing shareholder value.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks on the first quarter 2015. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. As there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then re-enter the queue to ask if there are no questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question, gentlemen, comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Mike Dahl, your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Hi and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dig in on cabinets a bit more because I think, from a top line perspective, that seems to be the one thing that's still missing from hitting the type of high single-digit growth that you guys continue to expect. So just if you think about the timing of some of the in-stock shipments, can you help us understand maybe what April has looked like or over what period of time should we expect that business to recover? And maybe any snapshot you can give on overall cabinets and then the in-stock specifically post-quarter?","Chris Klein","Sure. I think if you start and deconstruct the category a little bit for us, today, we've got about 40% of that business in the dealer market, which by the way will increase to over 50% after we complete Norcraft. So dealer business grew high single digits and we expect will continue to perform quite well. ","The in-stock business, which is now 20%, 25% of the business is a very attractive category for us. We won some significant business in fourth quarter of last year to transition that business in the first quarter. Our retail partner brought down inventory which they typically do ahead of the shipments that\u2019s sort of rolling in early part of April and that's rolling hard right now, the guys are working to ship all that in.","It will come in primarily in the second quarter and then into the third and then we will have repeat business off the back of that. So it\u2019s a very positive thing but obviously it makes the first quarter look a little soft.","On the semi-custom special order side of the business which is really kind of high teens for us, we talked a little bit about promotional activity, really as a result of some significant wins we've had over the last 18 plus months there, we've made some pretty good moves in the home centers and we\u2019ve see this happen before, we take share and our competitors seem to rely upon promotions, kind of promoting same old stuff as we are rolling new stuff in. ","And so we are in a good place there, if you look year-over-year, we gained share in the home centers. If you looked at it versus the fourth quarter, we gave up a little in the first quarter on some promo activity. But that's really not sustainable for them to continue to just promote the old stuff. We are bringing in new stuff that's getting the consumer excited.","So if you look at the overall category, obviously first quarter is the softest quarter for the whole industry. But we are pretty excited about where we are going and that's even without Norcraft. You bring Norcraft in on top of this, it's now over half of our business. On the dealer side, you look at the vanity and in-stock business, another 20% plus, you've got over 70% of our business that's in very attractive sustainable parts of that market, which we like a lot. So I think you will see, back to your original question, you will see that high-single-digit growth, that's some very strong margins which frankly is insulated against whatever competitors want to do on the promotional side and get knock themselves out and we are going to stand tall.","Mark Dahl","Thank you. That's very helpful. And then, my second question is then on the profit side. How much did those timing issues impact the profits in cabinets this quarter?","Lee Wyatt","That was a few million dollars. The other thing, though, that -- and we have talked about this in February was when we made the investments in capacity in the second half of '14, we created some inefficiencies around material usage, labor and efficiencies and those things and we have said in our February call there would be $5 million to $6 million of those inefficiencies flowing through in the first quarter. And that's exactly what happened.","And as we also said in February, those should be behind us at the end of the first quarter and we think that's what's happening now. So about $6 million was inefficiency carryover that we've estimated and discussed. There are a few million just on the kind of the timing of the in-stock business and then the first quarter is always very seasonally very low sales. So you don't get very much leverage on your fixed cost and we actually added a little fixed cost in the quarter just ahead of what we think is going be the market growing in the second quarter and even more in the second half.","So we didn't get much leverage there. So we are fine with our cabinet profitability. This is a business that we think by -- if you look at the mid-point of our guidance, we think that the operating margin will grow at least 100 basis points this year. It will leverage incremental sales by around 25%, which is our target. And again, I think it's just skewed a little in the first quarter because that's just a little sales and leverage period for us. So we feel fine about our cabinet profitability.","Mark Dahl","Okay. So that implies that then your -- if it's 25% for the full year still, then you are going to get up above 30% on the flow-through potentially starting in 2Q?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah, it could be above 25% for sure for the year. ","Mark Dahl","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Tim Wise with Baird. Tim, your line is open.","Tim Wise","Hey, good morning, everybody or good afternoon, actually.","Chris Klein","It's a long day. ","Tim Wise","Yeah, it's been a long week. So just maybe touching on the last question with the cabinet\u2019s profitability, how should we think of the year-over-year margin expansion? Should it be modest in the second quarter and then bigger in the second half? Just a little bit of clarity around that would be helpful.","Chris Klein","Yeah. When you look at our business, cabinets and other pieces of our business, you really have to look at the market growth. You start with the market growth assumption that we have. And as we said in February, we thought the first quarter would be the lowest. It would improve some in the second quarter, but most of the -- the largest improvement would be the second half. And I think that's how you will see the profitability as well, because we will start leveraging. I think you will see better leverage in the second quarter than in the first obviously, especially as we make up the sales on that in-stock cabinets and vanity business. But we will also just leverage higher sales. So I think it will be higher in the second, but I think the second half will be much higher. ","Tim Wise","Okay, perfect. Thanks. And then, I guess just looking -- with Norcraft, could you maybe talk a little bit about just how you guys think about just the internal capacity for incremental acquisitions? And then maybe just describe a little bit of the process how the Norcraft deal came together and kind of how you guys agreed on that.","Chris Klein","Sure. Norcraft is a terrific company first off, very high quality, very strong in the dealer side of the market, great reputation. And we've known them for a long time. Actually Mark Bullard, who is the CEO and his father ran a business that we bought as a company back in the early 2000s. And so as typical, in our categories, we know kind of what our quality business is and we are always impressed with them and just reached out to Mark and started a dialog. And these things take time. But they kind of unfolded in a way that made sense for both of us and we came together and it made sense for them, and it made sense for us.","We are excited because I think what we can do is very much what we\u2019ve done already with our cabinet business. We've got this master partner program where we've taken single product dealer relationships and turned them into multiproduct relationships. It's really been over the last five, six year, a lot of hard work, but we know exactly how to do that. We are going to take that same approach to their roughly 2,000 dealer network. There is only about 25% overlap on those accounts today. So we've got a lot of room to take our products into those relationships and by the same token, they have some absolute terrific products, Mid Con, StarMark, UltraCraft, that we can take into our existing relationship.","So it will unfold where there will be cost synergies early on as there always are. And then the revenue synergies will come over time as we bring all that together, but it is a great example of kind of harder the market, terrific integration into existing business, good degree of synergies and some strong accretion.","In terms of further capacity and things looking at -- cabinet guys are going to be busy with Norcraft a while, so we've continued to focus in the plumbing sector, we continue to focus in the security sector and Nick Fink is joining us who has been a long time -- somebody I've known for quite a while and he is a strong operator as well as strategy M&A guy. So that combination is just terrific. So he is going to be able to help us and we will have capacity to do something. So we will be focused on the cabinet side, but we have plenty of room to go ahead and do some other things as well.","Lee Wyatt","Let me put some numbers around what Chris is talking about and actually what he said in his remarks. So you assume the housing market recovers over the next three to four years to a 1.4 million, 1.5 million starts and we have 5% to 6% R&R during that period, free cash flow cumulatively could be in the $1 billion range that we could generate in that, say, four-year period. Depending on the level of debt, if we wanted to go 2 times or 2.5 times, you create another $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So cumulatively, during that roughly, say, four-year period, you would have $2 billion to $2.5 billion to spend. We just committed 600 of it, so we substantial amount left. So we feel very good about the opportunities and we've got some really good momentum and just a lot of flexibility to drive that incremental value with that spending.","Tim Wise","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Stephen, your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys. Wanted to ask about the Cabinet business. I think you mentioned dealer was up 8%. I wanted to know if you felt like that was a pretty good underlying demand run rate. Is that kind of where you think the market overall is looking for cabinet growth? And do you think that, therefore, we might think that that's what you might have gotten in your home centers or in your in-stock and vanities business that it just got pushed out into 2Q?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah, I would say it\u2019s high single digits, feel like it\u2019s probably about where it is right now. If you deconstruct that a little bit on the dealer side, interestingly the higher price point more custom middle market was stronger than that. And kind of the value part of the market was stronger, the middle part, kind of the mid-price points were a little bit weaker. So if you blend it altogether, we kind of get up to that kind of high-single-digits.","And I think that's probably that the market overall is probably running more like 6-ish percent, then we are picking up some share. I think that's kind of where the market is sitting right now. I think you could see some stronger performance on the R&R side of that market, especially if we see some existing housing stock turn. You could see that pickup into the second half of the year and certainly new construction helps cabinet business. It won't impact the in-stock business that much, but it will help the overall numbers on that side as well. So yeah, probably a reasonable proxy.","Stephen Kim","Great. And, Lee, I think you mentioned that the home center, semi-custom, build-to-direct in Canada sort of combined were flat. What was the home center, semi-custom and the build-to-direct sort of individually in terms of year-over-year change?","Lee Wyatt","They were all in that flat to 1% either side. ","Stephen Kim","Got it. Okay, perfect. And then lastly, on the cabinets, when you talk about the inefficiencies, I think you mentioned $6 million was directly related to the expansion investments. And then I think you mentioned a few million more for some other things and you mentioned fixed costs also for future growth. Was the fixed-cost sort of comment -- was that the few extra million or just I just wanted to be really precise about what the incremental spend was this quarter related to expansion investments and inefficiencies and that kind of thing.","Lee Wyatt","Yes, we end the year 2014, we look at our growth prospects for '15 in the space and we decide how much investment of fixed cost that we can support. So what we saw in the first quarter and so we make those and it could go in in the second half of '14, so you have an annualized until you get through the first half of '15. So from a fixed cost in the quarter which could be people and other things, probably saw between $1 million and $2 million increase and you notice it in the first quarter, because it's the lowest seasonal sales period, so you don't get to leverage on it. So it kind of stands out.","As we go into the second quarter on, it gets totally absorbed to the sales as a sales increase seasonally. So that was $1 million to $2 million. We had a few just little bit higher costs, $1 million or so just in some one-time items that will now wash out through the year and you won't have that same impact. So probably about $3 million there. ","Stephen Kim","Got it. Okay, great. Thanks very much guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Stephen your line is open. ","Stephen East","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.","Chris Klein","Good afternoon.","Stephen East","Chris, if you look at your plumbing, tremendous results there, both top line and your op margin, of course, pushing 20%. I guess the question there is, one, what do you think was driving it? Are you seeing some raw material benefits, et cetera? And what do you think the sustainability is as you move forward and sort of what do you think is driving the top line as well?","Lee Wyatt","The business is very healthy. The strongest parts, the wholesale side of that market where we're serving the new construction side actually that we think is going to build momentum throughout the year. We like the growth we saw there, high high-single digits. Inventory also is down in the wholesale channel. So there's some pretty significant upside for that business from the sales side throughout the year. I think you will see a stronger second half as some new construction comes in there.","When we sell product into new construction, on the plumbing, that's actually a more attractive product mix there. It's a stronger product set and the consumers are buying up. They are trading up, so they are buying the more expensive product going into their new homes. ","Retail side, results were good, but again the inventories are down at the retail. So POS was actually stronger than what our results were. So I would say, strong POS, new products coming in, selling through strong and we think inventory will probably tick up through the balance of the year. So that should continue momentum.","Commodity is pretty stable, so that\u2019s helping on the profitability side. And I commented a little about China, the direct-to-builder side of that market as you would expect is down a bit, but our retail stores are growing high-single digits and we think there is some pretty good remodel activity flowing through there. And we\u2019ve also worked hard to increase those stores productivity, call out the bottom performers and really focused on the stronger ones. ","So there is a lot of good things moving through and helping on the Moen side.","Stephen East","Okay. All right. So if I hear you, then, it sounds like this type of op margin is probably sustainable as we go through the year?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah, Stephen, this is Lee. If you look back to 2014, we were in the 19% plus range then. This is just to carryover of what we really did last year. ","Stephen East","All right. And then, Chris, if you look at Norcraft, and I'm going to also drag in SentrySafe here, just sort of your acquisitions, are these primarily, when you look at the synergy that you're getting, are they primarily driven by the topline or would you expect a lot of cost synergy coming through Norcraft? It sounded like when you were talking it was primarily topline.","Chris Klein","You know, on the Norcraft side, there is a lot of topline. There is some cost that will come out because you\u2019re taking a public company and taking the public company costs out it. So there is \u2013 that infrastructure in any public company that you don\u2019t need to replicate, because you\u2019re going to take them kind of within our systems. ","There will be some purchasing synergies on the cost side as well, so we are buying \u2013 we are a pretty big cabinet company and we are buying a lot of those components and we are going to have more leverage. And of course we have got some manufacturing capability down in Mexico now on the component side. So we have got some good cost savings through that. That step will come earlier, and that should be balance of \u201915 and into \u201916. ","Sales side, that is significant. It will just come kind of \u201916, \u201917 and keep going and that\u2019s been our experience as we looked at our core business and our ability to sell multiple lines into dealers. It\u2019s just a continuing process that helps you continue that pace of growth.","I don\u2019t know if you had a specific question on Sentry.","Stephen East","Yeah, just sort of, is that fully integrated now? And I assume that was all topline driven? And also, any update on Waterloo, if you have it?","Chris Klein","Sure. Sentry side, there is actually quite a bit cost synergies and that\u2019s still ongoing and that\u2019s what we expected. It\u2019s running ahead of schedule, but that will continue. We will get the Sentry operating margins up to the Master Lock margins, which have been pretty good kind of at low-teen, mid-teen type margins, and we will get Sentry to that level. So that will be quite significant. And then there will be some revenue synergies there as well. ","On the Waterloo side, we announced that was in discontinued operations as of the end of the year. We have done work to consolidate operations there and we are exploring kind of what the right ownership should be long-term there, and anybody else is interested in that. But it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got it to kind of a tighter operation to really reflect the revenue side of that business, which as we discussed before heavily dependent Sears and so it is what it is.","Stephen East","All right. Thank you.","Chris Klein","But that\u2019s moving along as we had hoped and probably even ahead of where we thought we would be right now on that process.","Stephen East","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Dennis, your line is open.","Dennis McGill","Hi, thank you guys. ","Chris Klein","Hey, Dennis.","Dennis McGill","Chris, I imagine this is kind of a blend when you formed your outlook using resources from the Street and macro-wise and so forth. But when you\u2019re forecasting the acceleration of businesses through the year, and I imagine 4Q is sort of the best of the year, what do you focus on most within your business? What do you focus on most today to give you confidence in that ramp?","Chris Klein","I guess, it\u2019s \u2013 you kind of break it down between new construction and repair and remodel market and our assumption this year was R&R little bit softer in the first quarter and then picked up a little bit, but kind of reasonable -- kind of maybe 4, 4.5 first quarter, rolling through to 5, maybe 5.5 in the better part of the year. So nothing dramatic there. ","On the new construction side, we lag a quarter to almost two quarters depending on the products. So the products that we build to inventory, so especially on the faucet side, our channels anticipate a little bit, so there is about a quarter lag. Cabinets will be built more closer to when they are actually installed, so that may lag a quarter and a half, even more so. ","So we are looking at new construction numbers and starts. Any activity that you would see -- fourth quarter, which show up in our business, late first quarter, second quarter, any activity we are seeing right now is going to show up on our business over the summer and into the fall.","If you look at 2013, it\u2019s a great example. So 2013\u2019s strong first half, everything kind of stopped in the summer, but there are plenty of houses they were still building on a lot of activity. We had some really big quarters, third and fourth quarter, both in plumbing and in cabinets. And everybody is looking at us like, what are you doing. And the rest of the markets kind of contracting while we are just finishing up what was started in the first half. So that kind of a lag flows through the business. ","So when we look at 2015 and we say, okay, we think building activity pick up late March, into April through the second quarter into the summer that will drive the second half of the year. So that\u2019s kind of the macro factor driving the market overall that we just kind of look at based on what happened last year and then we model our businesses after that. And we have picked up share gains throughout and so that keeps rolling through and you layer that on top.","Dennis McGill","So, Chris, is it fair to say then if you've got a visibility that what's happening now is going to be end of the year, that you're seeing sort of 15%, 20% growth among your new construction customers on the start side?","Chris Klein","No, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing and hearing and talking to. I mean, there is a lot of \u2013 there is lot of positive discussion that we are having with the people that we are selling to, both on the builders\u2019 side as well as the dealers and the showrooms. And some of that\u2019s translating into orders that we are starting to see right now, flowing through in April. Too soon to call the order flow for the whole spring, because it\u2019s kind of a funny first quarter, January was okay, February was soft, early March was soft and then all of a sudden, kind of later in the March, things picked up, again in April, things picked up, so it\u2019s just starting to build momentum, and our channels are positive. ","So I would say, yeah, I mean, I think that would support the kind of growth that we are looking for in the second half of the year. Nothing that happened in the first quarter scared us, it was a bit to plan and our EPS was right on plan, we came in right where we thought would be. ","Dennis McGill","Okay. Great. If I could sneak another one in just on the Norcraft side, you mentioned, I think, that of their dealers -- I don't know how this would look on your side, but 75% of their dealers you don't do business with? ","Can you just maybe educate us a little bit on why there would be that much of a gap in your overlap with your breadth in the market and the different price points and brands that you have and maybe that kind of leads into the opportunities as you see it?","Chris Klein","Yeah, I mean, that was, frankly, what made it too attractive, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re right, I mean, we are bigger of any [ph] dealer. But what they brought first on the product side, you\u2019ve got Mid Continent, which is very strong in that $150 to $300 cabinet category, where we\u2019ve got a presence, but we are not as big as we are in kind of full-on semi-customer. And so that product is a great addition to kind of from a price point where we are. ","As well as UltraCraft, which is on the frameless side. I mean, we\u2019ve got some frameless products, but we don\u2019t have as much frameless product as where the market is. So you\u2019ve got that product set that kind of would lend itself to set of dealers. And then geographically they are stronger in the west, really west of the Mississippi, so kind of through the Middle West, all the way out to West Coast, they have got a better representation. ","So it was kind of a product and price point on the one hand, and then geographic expansion. And so in kind of one fell swoop, it helped us expand in some places that we weren\u2019t. And we feel really good about where this sets us up and then the ability to kind of cross-pollinate with some product that we've got, be it kind of a stock builder product with Aristokraft into some of these dealers, or might be an Omega Dynasty type product launch. So there is a lot of places we think we can take it into their dealers. ","And then we are excited about their product, bringing Mid Cont at that price point into some of our dealers, as well as UltraCraft, StarMark, two terrific brands and products at kind of the right price points into our dealers. ","So if you\u2019re going to sketch one out, this one kind of checked a lot of those boxes, which is why we try to get it done.","Dennis McGill","All right. Good luck with it.","Chris Klein","Thank you.","Operator","Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael, your line is open. ","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","Chris Klein","Hi.","Michael Rehaut","First question I had was on plumbing. You had some nice improvement there and I think \u2013 but if you can kind of look at the margins, last year, you thought that excluding some of the harsh impacts from weather could have been closer to like a 19% margin. So here you have 19.5% off of a 7.5% topline growth. So just curious, actually, despite the good -- some improvement, what were the factors that perhaps prevented maybe a more normalized, let's say, dropdown in margin expansion that you would get from the solid topline growth?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah, this is Lee. When we look at 2014 margins for plumbing, we were at \u2013 we averaged 19.5% for the year last year, so I think we got there last year and I think that\u2019s pretty set at this point that we are pretty comfortable with it and that is a run rate that should be fairly sustainable unless we do something significantly on the sales line. ","So having a first quarter margin of 19.5% was pretty reasonable to us. There were a couple of quarters, in the middle of two quarters, last year in \u201914 for Moen, where they had a 20% operating margin. So 19.5% in the first quarter feels pretty reasonable. And if we maintain something in the 19% range for this year, we will be very happy. Our strategic issue with Moen is how do you drive more volume through with those kind of margins because it\u2019s very profitable, very successful.","Chris Klein","And that\u2019s really where our focus is, we are continuing to invest in the brand, we are investing in new products, we invest in showrooms and continue to invest in showrooms and displays. So all of that, we would rather be driving growth at these margins than slowing that investing down to just take the margins up high, so -- even higher than that. And a lot of those things are what's on the docket for the year is to try to drive that growth at those margins, and I expect that's what will happen.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. So, in other words, I think you are kind of referencing some of the incremental investment that you're doing in that business today?","Lee Wyatt","Yes, these are just ongoing normal investments that we'll make. Now we've said, that we will make more investments in the second half of this year around our supply chain, as you recall, last year we talked about $0.12 EPS in investments, mostly skewed to the cabinet business. This year, we've talked about on our guidance, previous guidance in February; we talked about around $0.08 with more of that skewed to Moen and a little more in the second half than the first half.","So we will continue to make investments to drive that business and we're still hopeful that we could have 19% operating margins even with those investments. So, it's a great brand, it is strong, it has great structural advantages that just don't go away and it just keeps performing, so we'll invest all day in that business.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. Fair enough. And then, just on the cabinet margins, you referenced some of the inefficiencies from 4Q continuing into 1Q and that was something that you highlighted in the last call. Is that behind you at this point? Or would there be any marginal lingering into the second quarter?","Chris Klein ","We think that's behind us, and really it's a byproduct of putting the capacity in and in the cabinet industry, putting capacity in is -- it comes in in chunks and there is no avoiding it, you put capital in and then you create the room in the plants and then you reorient the workflow and it screws up the workflow for a period of time, there is no other way do it and so, we did at a time in 2014, ahead of what we think is going to be a very strong next three years, because we saw the share gains that we've gotten.","So, yes, we feel good that's it behind us, it's something that you got to tackle from time to time. Every major cabinet company has got to take on, if you're going to put capacity in and you're going to do inside of an existing facility and not build a new plant, you're going to create some inefficiencies. It's not inefficiencies that are created because now the workforce somehow loses its way or we somehow stop being as efficient as we were before, it's really reorienting around, putting in new lines, manufacturing lines, finishing lines, docking and everything gets rearranged in a plant.","So, yes, we've got that; we worked hard at that last year, it kind of carried over just on the flow that's coming through right now but we're in a very good place to take on the demand that we see coming in the balance of this year and as well as going into the following year. Norcraft is in a pretty good place as well, they've got capacity that should take us through kind of 2018 and beyond, or maybe some things we add to those plants on the margin, but we're buying a pretty healthy operating system, strong management team, everything else there. So we think we're going to be in a very good place to take the volume that's coming out over the next few years.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie. Mike, your line is open.","Mike Wood","Hi. Thanks for providing all the color and taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the kind of 5% to 6% compounded growth that you are forecasting for Norcraft in the numbers you provided. Can I just confirm that -- are any sale synergies actually in those numbers in that horizon? It seems relatively consistent with what you\u2019re reporting in your legacy cabinets business already?","Chris Klein","I think we made reference to the fact that it could grow 450 [ph] beyond, I don't think, we're not pegging it at that number, so it was more of a parameter that it could grow. We would expect it would grow greater than that, beyond 450 [ph], so I won't do a linear calculation around that.","It should grow as well as its growing today Norcraft and then add to it the revenue synergies to take it up beyond that. So I think if it was going to grow high-single digits then, you could assume it should be growing in the low teens.","Mike Wood","Okay. And then you also gave the capacity in your pipeline, just in terms of the dollar amount you could spend. I'm curious if you can comment on whether or not you have larger deals in that pipeline and if you think there's any reasonable chance, near-term or over the next several years, you could actually bridge those valuation expectations and bring them over the finish line?","Chris Klein","Yes, it's hard to predict, there are a number of things in the pipeline, there is number of things we're actively working right now. I can never predict the probability of us successfully completing. I would say Norcraft is a great example, something that we were working on for a while and in parallel with a number of other things and that's one that came together in the right way and so, we got it done.","I'd say the same is true with other things we're working on, if you're working on enough things simultaneously, your chances of having something come through or a couple of those things, it doesn't have to be one big thing, it could be a couple of mid-sized things if they're the right fit. And so, we've got a number of those things in the flow, we've got a great team that's working hard on all this, and it's the combination of our -- at our business unit level as well as our corporate teams here.","And so, I think probabilities are pretty good over the few years that we'll be doing some more things. We'll stay disciplined and that will be governor around kind of our ability to get things done or not get the things done.","Mike Wood","Great, thank you.","Operator","Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Ken, your line is open.","Ken Zener","Thank you, good afternoon. Your comment around in-stock cabinets seems to be -- or I am assuming it refers specifically to WoodCrafters. Could you give us a sense, because that was a higher margin business when you -- a very high-margin business when you acquired it. Could you comment on kind of what your experience having owned that company, should appear you have relates to how inventory at the core channels were and what impact that had, so what percent, first-quarter sales, it tends to be light or heavy?","And then the impact that it actually had on your cabinet business? Because I assume if you missed sales there, that was actually somewhat of a margin drag as well? Thank you very much.","Chris Klein","The in-stock cabinets and vanities business is actually composed of a number of pieces, so we had a pretty healthy business already providing in-stock kitchen cabinets into retail, into retail, into the home centers, quite a sizable business and we did some vanities. We bought WoodCrafters and that brought some additional capabilities and then together through our distributor assembly network plus North America, we've been able to extend that out.","I referred earlier we've had some significant wins within the home center channel and so this year, in the first quarter, the issue was managing through taking inventory down as we\u2019re preparing to bring the new products in, and so there are multiple products and I wouldn't reference it directly to WoodCrafters.","Our experience with WoodCrafters has actually been quite good and it's both on the front-end side of the market as well as the back-end of the market in terms of manufacturing. We talked about last year, we've actually expanded a major facility, built a second plant right next door to one we had down in Mexico and that's going to feed a number of parts of our business both cabinetry, vanities, across all North America and that's -- instead of expanding our supply chain through China, we'll maintain China as part of supply chain but having a low cost manufacturing capability on components down in Mexico, with the lead times that we've got and the cost proportion is pretty exciting.","So it's really at this point pretty well integrated, and so the acquisitions played out as we thought it would but it's kind of integrated now into kind of the overall stock side of the business. I don't know if there's any more color you want to give.","Lee Wyatt","Just, Ken, on the operating margin, you're correct in we acquired WoodCrafters, it was 13% to 14% operating margin but -- and that's a business that is, the manufacturing process can be much more straightforward than say semi-custom cabinets. So what we've done here is, when we talk about in-stock as Chris said, its vanities and that's in home centers, its in-stock cabinets where we have exclusivity in one of the large home centers. So we brought all together, because it has similar manufacturing structure, it has similar product structure, and its in-stock versus make to order.","So we bring that together and right now it's 25% of our business and that's the place where we have advantages. So we're going to run all that together, and as we put it all together and as we integrate the manufacturing as Chris talked about for example WoodCrafters, we will have very strong margins, that's why we like that channel and that's why we're going to call all that out together.","And then coupled with dealer, which obviously you\u2019ve seen Norcraft's kind of margin potential. Now, when you got -- with them out there, when you've got 70% of your cabinet business in those two channels, which both have not only unique strengths and profitability profile, but very defendable leadership positions that's why we'll focus on that. So very good margin structures over time as we get it all integrated together.","Ken Zener","Thank you.","Operator","Gentlemen, your last question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Garik, your line is open.","Garik Shmois","Thank you. Just a quick follow-up to the last question. I just wondered if you could maybe provide a little bit more color, just as the install business ramps here in the second quarter, it sounds like it could potentially be mix positive to margins? Just wondering if you could confirm that thought and maybe just provide a little bit more color on how you would expect the margins in the cabinet business to progress.","Chris Klein","You start with the long-term prospective for cabinets, where we talk about getting, we were little under 8% last year, getting back to 14% plus as the housing market returns. So we like 100 basis points to 150 basis points on an annual basis to kind of get us on that run rate by three or four years to get back to that 14% plus. What you'll see in in-stock over time, it will have high margins and it will lead us there and it will be in that range.","I think what you find this time when we're ramping up new product line wins, it will drive volume, it will help margins, but there is still other cost of getting in and other cost of ramping up in the short run that will probably depress it, although it will favorable versus the first quarter. So it's a good investment, it's a good thing, and you'll see as the year progresses, just as the market improves, I think you'll see our profile in that in-stock category improve as well. So we feel very good about it, that's why we're focused on it.","Garik Shmois","Okay, great thank you so much.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer period.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams drove strong sales and profit gains in the first quarter as the home products market continued to grow at the pace that we expected. Our core businesses performed well across all segments and we remain focused on driving profitable growth. Based on the solid first quarter performance, the momentum we have inside of our businesses and our recent share repurchases, we are increasing our full-year EPS outlook.","Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the first quarter. Lee will then provide more details on our first quarter performance and 2016 outlook.","Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the first quarter, the market for our home products continued to grow at the pace that we expected it would. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew over 5% and new construction grew low double-digits. Repair and remodel activity remained steady with consumers continuing to demonstrate an appetite for more on-trend styling, product differentiation, and project complexity. We see the impact of these trends in the improving mix across our categories.","As anticipated, new construction demand is growing at a low double-digit rate and we expect single-family to grow faster than multifamily, as single-family entry-level activity is beginning to accelerate.","Additionally, we saw added strength for more days of good weather in the first quarter. And more broadly, our basket of near-term indicators point to stronger underlying demand and continued market momentum as we head into the busier seasons of the year for home products.","In fact, we think there could be some upside to market growth assumptions. As R&R and new construction demand look strong, financing at affordable rates is more accessible, and builders and contractors seem to be making progress on attracting more labor into the industry. In spite of these positive indicators, we think it's too early to revise our full year market outlook higher. So our overall assumption remains that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2016.","However, we are closely monitoring market activity as we move through the spring season and we will determine any further upside to our market assumptions as the year unfolds. Within that overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at around 5% rate and new home construction is assumed to grow around 10%.","Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the first quarter, sales increased 16% in total and 20% for our U.S. home products businesses. Importantly, total company operating margin increased 180 basis points to 9.5% with solid performance across all operating segments.","Starting with our Cabinet segment, we continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continue to drive strong performance. In the first quarter, our overall Cabinet sales were up 34% over the prior year, and increased 12% excluding the Norcraft acquisition with broad growth across all channels. Specifically, sales in our largest channel, dealers, grew 62% and 16% excluding the Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains are coming from our new construction product lines in this channel and deeper multi-line relationships with existing customers. We're beginning to cross-sell more of our product lines across our recently expanded dealer network.","Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanity sales grew mid-single-digits due largely to sell-through of new programs and product upgrades that we launched last year. Our Cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to consistently balance inventory levels with production to further enhance service and manufacturing efficiency.","The remaining 25% of our Cabinets business, which includes home center semi-custom, builder direct in select markets, and Canada, grew strong double-digits. We're disciplined in our approach to these segments as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth.","With our focused approach, we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We are especially pleased with our home center special order business where our partnership approach is working well and driving nice growth.","The Norcraft acquisition is on track. Cost savings are running ahead of initial projections. We're adding capabilities, and we're beginning to see some sales benefits as well. It's a wonderful combination and the teams are working well together.","Overall for Cabinets, we continue to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plants are increasingly more efficient and we are pleased we added capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized.","On the front end of the business, we're performing particularly well as we build share in the most attractive segments of the market by deepening our partnerships with dealers, home centers, and builders. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix, and our improving margins.","For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 2% for the quarter with solid mix and strong operating margin. Sales increased 6%, excluding the negative impact of currency and some channel inventory reductions by select wholesale and retail customers who drew down inventory in the quarter as we expected. We remain on track for our Plumbing sales to increase mid to high single-digits for the full year.","In the first quarter, POS growth ran at mid-single-digits across U.S. wholesale and retail. So far in the second quarter, customer orders are running ahead of POS levels and we have a number of product introductions that are flowing into the market coupled with investments we have made in showroom displays and marketing programs.","Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve as innovation and design, finish and function attract consumers who trust our brand. In the coming quarters, we have a strong lineup of new products which include additional Magnetix, easy-docking, easy-releasing showerheads, pull-down and pull-out faucets with Reflex center, Kendall, Glenshire and [indiscernible] Dartmoor bath suites targeting builders and wholesale showrooms.","Sales in Canada were down low single-digits to the prior year, but were up high single-digits excluding the negative impact of currency. China sales increased low single-digits versus prior year, but were up mid-single-digits in local currency, driven primarily by our retail stores and e-commerce. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential and are encouraged by their R&R activity that we are seeing.","Doors reported sales were up 13% for the quarter, Door products again saw sales growth driven by gains in both new construction and retail. Mix continued to improve. The consumer is more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and premium upgrades. Like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors that capitalize on the growing trend toward taller doors and wider openings.","In addition to innovative new products, furniture is benefiting from last year's rollout of our refreshed retail strategy. That includes an enhanced product lineup, simpler more intuitive displays, and better sales support for our customers' associates. And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the Western United States.","In Security segment, sales increased 1% from the prior-year quarter and were up approximately 3.5% excluding the negative impact of currency and exited Sentry product lines. The growth was driven by mid-single-digit increases in both Master Lock U.S. retail and U.S. commercial. These increases were somewhat offset by the planned exit of some less profitable Sentry Safe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. We continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years. And the integration of Sentry into Master Lock is on track to be completed this summer.","So to recap the quarter, results were strong. We again executed well in the U.S. home products market that is continuing to grow as we expected. Our teams are delivering profitable growth on that momentum.","Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now, we're busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions. We're assessing a number of opportunities. And while we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, I'm encouraged with the number of things we're looking at and the quality of these businesses.","Meanwhile in the first quarter, we were again successful at repurchasing some of our shares at very attractive prices. It's important to note that we repurchased our shares as part of a process, which highlights when a significant disconnect is occurring between the equity markets valuation and our expected long-term business performance. Over the next three years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value.","To sum up, the demand for our home products remained strong as we expected, and we continue to grow faster than our market. Our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth, and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our increased EPS outlook for 2016.","Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.","Let me start with our first quarter results. Sales were $1.1 billion, up 16% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 20% for our U.S. home products businesses. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $105 million, up 43%, or $32 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.39 for the quarter versus $0.28 the same quarter last year, increasing nearly 40% and were ahead of plan due to more days of good weather, timing of expenses and recent share repurchases.","And now let me provide more color on the segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $550 million, up $139 million, or 34% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $89 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $273 million, and increased 62% from the prior year. In-stock Cabinets and vanity sales of $110 million increased 6%. The remaining sales for home center, semi-custom, builder-direct and Canada increased 23%, excluding the negative impact of approximately $4 million from Canadian currency.","Operating income for the Cabinet segment nearly tripled, increasing $24 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $5 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter doubled to 6.8%. Operating leverage excluding Norcraft was 37%, as our recently added capacity continues to become more efficient. For the full year, we continue to expect an operating margin approaching 11% compared to 9% in 2015.","Turning to Plumbing, sales for the first quarter were $339 million, up $5 million or 2% led by U.S. retail and wholesale, and China. Excluding the negative impact of currency of $6 million, and U.S. channel inventory reductions, total Plumbing sales increased approximately 6%, Canadian sales increased 8%, and China sales increased 6%.","Operating income increased $7 million to $72 million, up 11%. Operating margin for the segment was 21.2%, up 180 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the full year 2016, operating margin could be above 20%.","Door sales were $94 million, up $11 million or 13% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased $5 million, and operating margin for this segment was 4.5%. Full year operating margin for this segment could be at least 11%.","Security sales were $124 million in the first quarter, up 1% to the prior year, and up approximately 3.5% excluding the negative impact of currency of $1 million and the planned exit of less profitable SentrySafe product lines as part of the broader Sentry integration. Segment operating income increased to $12 million, and the segment operating margin was 9.3%, up 120 basis points from the prior year.","To sum up consolidated first quarter performance, sales increased 16%, and EPS was ahead of plan at $0.39. Our total company operating margin was 9.5%, up 180 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin excluding acquisitions of 40%. We're squarely on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady-state.","Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total first quarter sales by approximately $11 million with Canada being the primary source. The EPS impact was around $0.01. We expect to continue to experience headwinds from currency until the second half of the year.","Now turning to the balance sheet. On March 31, balance sheet remained solid with cash of $254 million, debt of $1.6 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is two times. By year end, we expect leverage to be about 1.4 times. We currently have $450 million drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility as a result of recent share repurchases.","In the first quarter, we repurchased more than 7.6 million shares for approximately $363 million. The share repurchases positively impacted first quarter EPS by $0.01 and could provide an incremental $0.06 of EPS for the full year 2016 and $0.02 in the first quarter of 2017. At an average purchase price of $47.43, we already see a significant return on the first quarter share repurchases, and we have $285 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. While our basket of market indicators is biased to the upside, we continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. home products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6% with share gains and additional second quarter sales from the Norcraft acquisition. We continue to expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015.","However, we've increased our full year EPS outlook based on our recent share repurchases and our strong first quarter performance. Our outlook for 2016 EPS is now in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 with the midpoint reflecting a 23% increase over the prior year. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to be $350 million to $375 million with a conversion rate of over 90%.","The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions. Interest expense of around $50 million, a tax rate of 33%, average fully diluted shares of approximately 157 million, a positive impact from commodity cost that will partially offset both a negative impact from currency in the first half of 2016 and a double-digit increase in healthcare cost.","In summary, we're off to a strong start to 2016. First quarter market growth was as expected, and we delivered strong sales and profit growth. We were also able to again opportunistically repurchase our shares at attractive prices, and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.","I'll now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks on the first quarter of 2016. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I will ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall","Thank you. Congratulations on a fantastic quarter.","Christopher Klein","Thank you, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall","Just wanted to ask you, Chris, what's the theme for 2016 based on what you've seen so far? The 180 basis points of operating margin expansion was a lot more than we were anticipating. I know you've invested heavily the last couple of years in Cabinet capacity, in Doors and Plumbing. Is what we're seeing in today's results kind of the fruition of the past investments, how much more upside is left?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. I think it really is the cumulative impact of a number of things. So on the operational side, we put some capacity in and we're seeing the efficiency come through both on the Cabinets side as well as things we've done with Doors, and we're doing with faucets. Mix is improving, so we're just seeing a richer mix come through a lot of that's being driven by new products that we've introduced into the market. And so that's strong.","Channel mix looks good. So I think we're on track as we've said to about a 15% operating margin at steady state, making good progress against that. And kind of I'd say the other theme for the year is keeping up with the growth. We see good indicators for the balance of the year, potentially some upside to what we've put out there as our forecast for the total year. We'll see after the spring season where we come in, but things look good. I mean, the market looks very healthy. There's a lot of demand out there both R&R and new construction. So, yeah, I guess, kind of keeping up with demand.","Robert Wetenhall","Okay. And for my second question, I wanted to ask you in your thought process and maybe Lee can jump in here. In making your capital allocation decision, you went on offense, your timing on the buyback was fantastic. How do we think about what you're seeing in the pipeline and the value you can create versus M&A versus what you're looking to do on buybacks and how should we be thinking about share count as we move through the year and when you would step back in the market and buy the stock versus what you have in the pipeline? Thanks and great quarter. Good luck.","Christopher Klein","First off, to the extent we see good M&A, we're going to be active there. We've got a lot of things that we're working on. I never predict the timing of those things or success rates, but I'd say we're very busy. And so we foresee deploying some capital this year in M&A. And I think that I can't predict kind of how many of those or how much.","On the repurchase side, we look at this continuously running internal returns against our plan and our plan isn't just kind of a static plan. It's our plan in light of where we see the underlying demand on the market. And when there is a significant misalignment, it's an opportunistic situation and that's exactly what we saw in January and February was a misalignment there between the underlying demand driving our R&R market, driving new construction, the orders that we were seeing come in and then where the equity values were. So, it was a very good time.","Not that different from summer of 2014. We did the same thing. And in 2014, we bought back 400 million plus in shares in a similar circumstance where we left out versus demand and saw similar disconnect. So that's \u2013 in a nutshell that's kind of what drove that. Lee, you can comment on the share count for the year.","Lee Wyatt","Yes. So, right now, we're using a fully diluted share count of 157 million. That assumes no other purchases this year, but we'll play that by year. I think the other just comment would be that, if you look at what we've done through the end of 2015, and we've spent about $1.8 billion prior to this year, about $1.1 billion in acquisitions and about $550 million in share repurchases on an opportunistic basis as Chris defined, that's a nice mix.","If we could do that going forward, that would be great. If we have different opportunities on share repurchase, we can do that. So I think the key here is its flexibility. We have a lot of capital and it's just being opportunistic. I think Chris is always very clear our major goal is just driving incremental value and maximizing that. So it's pretty flexible with us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Scott Rednor","Hey, good afternoon. Nice quarter.","Christopher Klein","Thanks, Scott.","Scott Rednor","Chris, I wanted to ask, I think a couple years of age when weather was a headwind, you had mentioned that about half of the sales of the portfolio were in the Northeast and Midwest. And I was curious with given how favorable weather was this year, what the trends were in that region and how that factors into the planning assumptions?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. So we definitely had better weather and more building days than we've had over the last couple of years. And I think we saw that impact in our cabinets group as well as in Therma-Tru our door group, less so with Moen I don't think it was impacted that negatively or positively one way or the other. So I think that was positive. And I think it was running consistent with the rest of the country. So we saw strong demand, in R&R, strong demand new construction, nationally. But in the past we had, as you pointed out, we have seen big differences between the activity in Northeast, Midwest and what we're seeing in the rest of the country. This time around the whole country was looking consistently good, so on a comp basis, those markets look better.","Scott Rednor","Okay. Great. And then Lee, how should we think about the progression of incremental margins this year given the comment that there was some timing of expenses in 1Q?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah. So we recall our operating margin in total last year, total company was 11.8%. Our guidance this year is built around an operating margin and it's that's about 100 basis points higher. So we said about 12.8%. So I think you'll see kind of normal progression for the balance of the three quarters of the year versus last year. I think the other thing that the takeaway here is that if we \u2013 and we are on track obviously with the first quarter up 180 basis points, but we're clearly on track on the 15% when the market gets to steady-state. We only need about 100 basis points a year to get there. So we're on track so far this year.","Scott Rednor","So just to clarify, there's no variability we should think about 2Q through 4Q relative to what you saw in 1Q?","Lee Wyatt","Not a lot because the performance was fairly consistent. Second half had a little bit stronger performance last year than the first half, but I don't think that's a material difference.","Scott Rednor","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Hey, guys, nice job.","Christopher Klein","Thanks, Tim.","Tim Wojs","I guess, just kind of going back to your comments on the environment, maybe a little bit of bias to the assumptions that you have embedded in guidance. Just I mean, where in some of the near-term indicators that you're looking at, I mean, is it broad-based possible upside or are there certain pockets where you're seeing better mix, more volume strength, just maybe a little bit more color on \u2013 just some of the areas where there could possibly be some upside as we go through the year?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. I think the consistency looks like in R&R, I mean, it's running ahead of where we saw it last year, but I think it's kind of as we look at it, probably 5% to 6% consistent running throughout the year. I think where we'll see a little bit more upside is in single family new constructions.","So if you look at kind of overall activity there, flow from orders, which looked like they were up kind of, I don't know. 12% 13% first quarter, permits for the whole quarter in single-family up probably 14%, starts for the quarter up 22%. There's a little bit longer construction cycle, but total units under construction up for the quarter in like 19%, purchase finance applications up 18%.","So those are big numbers, I mean relative to where we've been. And so, if we're lagging a quarter or two, that should turn into some more significant demand coming into late second quarter and into the second half. So that's where I'd see that variability. It's got to play through yet and the reason we haven't factored that into everything we're talking about with the guidance yet is let's see it keep flowing. If building gets backed up, not just new construction but R&R gets backed up on labor, then it won't flow as good, but if they're keeping pace with it, there really could be some additional tailwinds behind us coming into the second half of the year.","I'd say builders and R&R contractors are doing better job on getting labor. If you look at the latest employment reports, construction jobs up 7%, 8% in residential construction labor. So that's running ahead of overall employment, which is only up 2% plus. So they're doing a nice job of finding labor there that's out there. But with this kind of demand coming through the system, they've got to keep that up. So I'd say let's see how it unfolds, but boy, those look like big pretty good numbers relative to what we've seen over the last few years.","Tim Wojs","Couldn't agree more. I guess just turning to the Cabinets business, the comp in the first quarter was a little easier than it is the rest of the year, so just for modeling purposes, how should we think about how that growth kind of filters in the remainder of the year? I mean, should we still continue to see maybe high single-digit growth in Cabinets through the balance of 2016?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah. I think you could. I think we'll anniversary in the second quarter the Norcraft acquisition. But I think you could see embedded throughout the year high single-digits organically there.","Tim Wojs","Right. Well, good luck on the rest of the year. Thanks.","Christopher Klein","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zener","Afternoon.","Christopher Klein","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth Zener","The 16% growth in Cabinets that you cited, the dealer organic, could you talk about the demand you're seeing there, and if it's outpacing what you think is the overall Cabinet market as well as try to talk about, you keep talking about favorable mix, so are we to assume half of that is volume and half is mix on your new product introductions? Thank you.","Christopher Klein","Yeah. It's probably more volume, but there's a good mix, so that's the latter part of your question. I'd say really dealer is firing across all segments. So we sell to midsize smaller builders through dealer. That business looks good so our Aristocrat product line saw some pretty good growth overall as well as the semi-custom and premium lines that go into that builder business. The remodel business looks strong.","As I said earlier, kind of North, Northeast, Midwest was a bit better than it had been over the last couple of winters. But it was a lot of things that was pretty widespread. And it really reflected a lot of, we saw a lot of activity in the fourth quarter coming into the first quarter. A lot of showroom activity coming through our dealer base. We got a big dealer base. So we got 5,500 dealer customers. So when we say, hey, we see some pretty good activity coming through, we tend to believe it.","And so that was happening in the fourth quarter and I think that activity started to flow through in the first quarter and should continue second quarter and through the balance of the year. So it was pretty widespread. The mix, as I said, driven by continuous pace of new product. Consumers are trading up. So they are buying our new products because it's attractive product and it's on trend. And I just think it's a trend we've seen flow through the business, but that definitely helps as you look at kind of total growth for the year.","Kenneth Zener","Thank you. And the next question is a bit more macro. It's related to both your regional exposure as well as the near-term drivers that you've talked about. I think you've talked in the past about your concentration in the Northeast. If you could kind of update that numerically for us as well as Texas and maybe West. And the second component is with near-term drivers, one of which obviously being existing sales, which we think is set to slow growth year-over-year, can you talk about some of the other factors you talked about, you talked about refinancing, so I assume HELOCs? Thank you.","Christopher Klein","Yeah. In terms of balance \u2013 well, we certainly have considerable business up Northeast, Midwest, and if you look across, look at Cabinets with Norcraft, we've expanded our overall penetration. And I'd say we're strong across all North America, both the whole U.S. as well as Canada. Certainly, our Moen business has always been a solid North American as well as, obviously, China business. And Therma-Tru have strong Northeast historically, but we did a lot to expand out West in terms of distribution. And so that business is really a national U.S. business across.","So I think where we had opportunities to expand West, we have. And I like the balance of the business and I don't see any part of the market that we're not capturing if it's growing, it's coming on the R&R side. Where new construction's growing in certain parts of the market, we'll be there and we'll grow.","In terms of Texas, we talked a little bit last time about kind of the oil patch, more than 5%. Interestingly, our Door business we've actually seen some growth down there because we expanded some distribution, so the Door business is actually up in Texas, so we're growing faster there than we are in some of the parts of the country. I don't think we've seen anything really extraordinary. I'm sure it's growing faster than our other businesses and Cabinets or faucets in Texas relative to the rest of the country, but we haven't seen it. In the first quarter, we didn't see it fall off to any extraordinary extent.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Mr. Bosshard, your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","Thank you. I wanted to dig into the Plumbing business if you could. It sounded like POS low single-digits in the quarter expected revenue for the segment up 5% to 9% for the year. Can you just talk about a little bit of what you're seeing in that business in terms of demand, the first thing I'd love to understand?","Christopher Klein","Sure. Yes, demand was strong for the quarter, mid-single-digit growth for the year that will be more like mid to high. We're rolling new product in and that's coming into the market now. And so we'll get some lift from that as well as overall demand. If we look just over the last five weeks, orders are running ahead of POS. So you're sitting up strong. There was some inventory, a couple of our larger customers had both retail and wholesale, coming into the year we knew that they'd be taking that down throughout the quarter, which they did. And then started bringing back up margin and we'll see that come back in April.","In terms of overall demand, it's kind of the same \u2013 seeing some of the same dynamics in mix, as I talked about in Cabinets. We are getting the advantage and we're bringing out richer mix products, new products, higher price points. We're seeing consumers trade up both on new construction and R&R. And a lot of our product we're bringing in is targeting take advantage of that. So, pretty healthy market overall. Most of this is talking about North America. China actually pretty good quarter. POS running well. R&R there looks solid. The new construction direct to builder is flat, not down. It's probably a little bit better than we might have thought, doing well, retail e-commerce there. POS kind of high single-digits on the retail e-commerce side. It's actually pretty healthy relative to what everybody talks about what we might have expected. So...","Eric Bosshard","That's helpful. And then secondly in Cabinets, the magnitude of your market share gains, in either the dealer or the home center channel, it sounds like the dealer channel, the share is better. Could you just frame what that looks like now and what you're expecting relative to what you accomplished in 2015?","Christopher Klein","Yes. It is strong. I think it's \u2013 we are gaining share there. Let me start with dealer. We're gaining share across accounts, we're going deeper into accounts, we brought new product in. Kind of we're cross-pollinating between Norcraft product line and BCI product line. And it's really a cumulative effect of a number of things we've done over the years that's really positioning us well.","On the home center side, we've got a very good position there on special order and we think we've picked up some share there. We've been very consistent. We've talked in the past about promotions and we've been disciplined and consistent and that's really resonating. So we bring new product in. We're really focused on service. And we are consistent in whatever we're doing on the promotional side. And that combination and working with the designers really seems to be resonating. So that's going well.","And on the builder side, we talked about exiting in the West some direct to builder business, but we didn't get out of the direct to builder business, we just focused on some good relationships East and Southeast. And those are going well. So in that part of that market, we're picking up share there.","So it's pretty deep across a lot and it's a really complicated business as a lot of the Cabinet guys talk about and as we talk about all the time and we focus on getting all the complicated stuff right. And we got a great team. And I'd say the people are really what are responsible for executing every day and getting this stuff right. So I know it kind of sounds like, it's not easy one thing to point to, but really is it's like the conductor of an orchestra, kind of getting everything to work right. And that's what Dave Randich and our Cabinets guys do every day is get all that right. And that's resulting in share gain.","And I'd say, part of your question was 2015 versus 2016, I think we're going to continue to pick up share throughout the year. We're executing really well across all these channels. And it's a good environment and we see underlying demand across the whole thing. So we're going to have a pretty good year in Cabinets.","Eric Bosshard","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll allow some time to address questions that you may have. I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Brian. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we expected the rate of growth for the home products market accelerated in the third quarter and our teams again delivered sales and profit growth that was right on plan. Importantly, our core businesses are performing well across segments and we are building momentum for 2016. Our outlook anticipates expect market conditions in the fourth quarter remain similar to the third quarter driven by like levels of new construction activity and consistent growth in repair and remodel market. Based on that market assumption, solid execution of our plans for the third quarter and the momentum we have inside of our businesses, we are confirming our full year outlook. ","Let me first spend some time on our view of the US home products market and then I will provide my perspective on our underlying business performance. Starting our view of US home products market, the third quarter the growth rate in the market for our home products improved at an increasing rate as we expected they would. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at around 5% and new construction grew low double digit. We continue to see positive signs and look for similar market conditions in the fourth quarter and are building our momentum heading into 2016. Repair and remodel activity remain steady growing around 5%. We are encouraged by the richer mix we see coming through new model projects at all pricing tiers, some recent consumer research we completed this summer, reinforces that home owners are focused on creating unique and on trend style and when they engage in remodel project, they are looking to create authentic looks and more open spaces. This is translating into an appetite for stronger styling, product differentiation and project complicity. We see the impact of these trends and the improving mix across our categories. ","New construction activity and demand continues to build in an accelerated pace in the second half of 2015. We also note that the pace of start to completion continues to be governed by constrain labor supply which seems to be lengthening the normal lag we see between housing starts and when our products go into new homes. We are watching closely to see how the more robust starts and new construction activity we are seeing in the second half of 2015 positively impacts our sales outlook heading into the first half of 2016. ","So our overall assumption is that the U.S. home products market which impacts 70% of our sales grows at a combined 6% to 7% rate for the full year 2015. Within that overall assumption the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at around 5% rate. New home construction is assumed to grow around 10% over 2014. ","Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the third quarter, sales increased 22% for the U.S. businesses. Importantly, operating margin increased to 110 basis points to 13.5% with solid performance across all operating segments. Starting with our Cabinet segment, as I discussed many times we are following a disciplined strategy for Cabinet focused on profitable growth. At the center of this strategy is our dedication to the designer as the key customer and our focus on the most attractive segments of the market. A consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to channel partners drive growth. Importantly, our Cabinet business is now solidly positioned in the most attractive segments in the market. Nearly 75% of our annual Cabinet sales should be generated from the dealer channel and home seller in start cabinet and vanities. These are not only the most consistent and profitable segments of the business, but are also where we have our strongest structural competitive advantages. ","Turning to the third quarter for Cabinet. Our overall Cabinet sales were up 33% over the prior year quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 38%, up 14% excluding the Norcraft acquisition. U.S. sales per dealer and in stock cabinets and vanities which account for approximately 75% of our annual sales increased 52%, up 21% excluding Norcraft acquisition. Specifically sales in our largest channel, dealers grew 60% and 11% excluding Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains in this key channel are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers as well as new dealerships.","Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanity sales increased strong double digit due largely to the impact of new programs and product upgrades that continue to ship in the third quarter. We now have fully launched these new programs and expect continued growth in the coming quarters from strong sell-through and share gains. Remaining 25% of our Cabinet's business focused on home center semi-custom, builder direct in select markets in our Canadian sales.","We are disciplined in our approach to the segments of the cabinet market as we focus on where we can partner with customers to capture profitable growth. Together these segments, we are up slightly in the quarter, but up mid-single digits when adjusted for Canadian currency.","Overall, for cabinets, our teams continuing to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plants with recently expanded capacity are increasingly more efficient. And we are pleased we have added this capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized. ","On the front end of the business, we\u2019re performing particularly well as we build share on the most attractive segments of the market. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins.","For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 5% for the quarter. Sales increased 8% in U.S. led by growth in both wholesale and retail. Again, in the third quarter, our mix was solid and margins were strong. Wholesale sales increased mid single digit as channel inventories remain lean. Retail also grew mid single digits driven by new product performances and strong POS.","We are encouraged to see consumers trade up and continue to select our innovative new faucet shower products for their new homes and repair and remodel projects, including new pullout and pull down faucets with reflex self-retraction in our Essie and Benton lines and our Magnetix easy docking, easy releasing shower heads. And we will continue our pace of innovation in the coming quarters as we introduce new products which include additional pull down and pull up faucets with reflex our Kendall, Glenshire and Kinzel lines, and additional styles with our motion sense hands-free technology. ","Sales in Canada were down low double digits to the prior year, but were up high single digit in local currency. China sales increased mid single digit versus the prior year due to increase direct-to-builder activity in retail. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential and are encouraged by the R&R activity that we\u2019re beginning to see.","Doors reported sales were up 8% for the quarter. Door products saw sales growth driven by gains in both new construction and retail. Mix continued to improve with consumers more frequently, choosing our decorative glass designs and premium upgrades like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors in the American style and Rustic collection that capitalize on growing trends towards taller doors and wider openings. The Therma-Tru brand continues to perform strongly across all channels and we\u2019re benefiting from our expanded distribution.","In the Security segment, sales increased 2% from the prior year quarter with U.S. sales up 6%. Sales from the SentrySafe acquisition and a 5% increase in Master Lock U.S. retail sales drove the growth. Currency and international softness offset the U.S. growth. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities we see in our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years and the teams are working hard to complete the operation integration by the middle of 2016.","So to recap the quarter, our performance improved in the US home products market while growth accelerated as we expected due to new construction activity. Our teams are executing well in delivering profit result on plan. ","Before I wrap up, I\u2019d like to comment on our efforts drive incremental long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. The integration of the recent Norcraft acquisition remains right on track. The integration is very straightforward, our new employees are terrific and the opportunities are as good as we thought they would be. ","Looking forward our acquisition pipeline remains robust. We are assessing a number of opportunities both inbound and outbound and now we cannot guarantee success in any one situation. I am encouraged with the number things we are looking at, and the potential we have to create incremental shareholder value over time. Our track record and capabilities in M&A are strong. Over the past two and half years, we've spent $1.1 billion on four acquisitions and repositioned ourselves for strong growth by selling Simonton Windows and tool storage business. ","Over the next three years, we believe we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value. ","So to sum up, 2015 continues to progress as we expected. We remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the home products market, our core businesses are strong and we are building momentum as we head into 2016. Our strong brands, management teams, and capital structure provides flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. ","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our guidance.","Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our third quarter results which were on plan. Sales were $1.24 billion, up 17% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 22% for our U.S. businesses. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $168 million, up 28% or $36 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.64 for the quarter, versus $0.52 the same quarter last year, increasing 23% and were on plan.","Now let me now provide more color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $603 million, up $151 million or 33% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $105 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $299 million, and increased 60% from the prior year and 11% excluding Norcraft. In-stock cabinets and vanities sales of $139 million, increased grown double digit, reflecting load in shipments to support new product wins. The remaining sales for home center, semi-custom, builder direct in Canada increased 5% excluding the negative impact of approximately $7 million from Canadian currency.","Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased 75% or $27 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $15 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased 250 basis points to 10.6%. As expected, operating leverage excluding Norcraft was 33%, as our recently added capacity is becoming more efficient. For the full year, we continue to expect an operating margin of around 9% compared to 7.7% in 2014.","Turning to Plumbing. Sales for the third quarter were $364 million, up $19 million or 5%, led by U.S. retail, U.S wholesale and China, all of mid single digit. Excluding the $9 million negative impact of currency, total plumbing sales increased 8%. Canadian sales increased 7% and China sales increased 8%.","Operating income increased $6 million to $82 million, up 7%. Operating margin for the segment was 22.4%, up 40 basis points from the prior-year quarter. For the full-year 2015, operating margin should be around 20%. ","Door sales were $124 million, up $9 million or 8% from the prior-year quarter. Operating income increased $5 million to $17 million, up 39%. Operating margin for the segment was 13.6%, up 290 basis points from the prior-year quarter. Full-year operating margin for this segment should approach 9.5%, a significant improvement over 7.1% the prior year.","Security sales were $147 million in the third quarter, up 2% to the prior year and up 6% in US. The impact of foreign currency reduces sales by $4 million in the quarter. Segment operating income increased to $21 million and the segment operating margin was 14.2% with Master Lock operating margin at 16.3%. To sum up consolidated third quarter performance, sales increased 17% and EPS were on plan at $0.64.","Our total company operating margin was 13.5% with an incremental margin of 35% excluding acquisitions. We are on track to reach our long-term goal approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state levels. Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total third quarter sales by approximately $21 million with Canada being the primary source, the EPS impact was approximately $0.02.","Turning to the balance sheet, Our September 30 balance sheet remain solid with cash of $351 million, debt of $1.3 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.7x. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.5x. We currently have nothing drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility. From July 1 until today, we have repurchased around $50 million of our shares. In the quarter, we also closed on sale of our tool storage business. Through working capital reductions, tax benefits and the sales proceeds, we generate approximately $70 million of cash. ","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2015. Based on our projected 6% to 7%, U.S. home products market growth, the assumptions we make for our other markets, and continued share gains, plus the Norcraft acquisition, we expect full year 2015 sales to increase 14% to 15% compared to 2014. We narrowed the outlook for 2015 EPS but maintain the midpoint of the range resulting in EPS of $2.05 to $2.07. ","We expect 2015 free cash flow to be around $300 million after CapEx of $135 million. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions. Interest expense of $32 million, a tax rate of 32.7%, average fully diluted shares of approximately $163 million.","In summary, the third quarter EPS were on plan with market growth accelerating as expected. The solid performance of core business, the recent investments made to increase capacity, and steps taken to reposition our portfolio for stronger growth, as well as the expected continuing market recovery gives us confidence in continued solid growth in the coming years.","As demonstrated by the Norcraft acquisition and recent share repurchases, we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value with our new debt structure providing significant flexibility.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks on the third quarter of 2015. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions since the maybe a number of you would like to ask question, I ask that you limit your initial questions two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions. I'd now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the Q&A answer session. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from Bob Wetenhall with RBC. Your line is open.","Bob Wetenhall","Hey, good afternoon. Hey, Chris. Just wanted to ask, you guys came in exactly kind of very consistent with your guidance. I think there have been a lot of questions about the guidance and its achievability. Just for my question I was hoping could you give us a little bit color on the market? And really what are you seeing on the demand side? You guys obviously outpace the market but how strong is demand on underlying basis, what kind of volume growth are you expecting across the portfolio? ","Chris Klein","Yes, Bob, it really came of, we expected it would so as we said here in the second quarter looking at all the figure that we compare and then talk to our channels and looked like we are setting up for a stronger second half. Our number pretty consistent around 5% but a good mix coming through. I think you saw that coming through on our margins. New construction moving it was low teen new construction and if you roll together probably 7% and 7.5% overall between R&R and new construction and that compares to our growth if you take Norcraft out in the US market about 10% so we outpace that growth, really I think it's the result of the activities, the demand that we see coming in spring to the summer orders translating into starts and then the construction activity picking up. And what we have observed is there is a little longer lag between starts and when demand is coming for our products in the home becoming towards the end of the home construction with cabinets, entry doors and plumbing and so we are seeing probably a month to two months additional lag in the system, it is not hurting our current results because we are going living off what was happened in the first half. But we think it's probably setting up a reasonably strong start to 2016, we are just trying to gauge how much of that's going to fall in 2016 so we took bit of our second half in this year and we are getting encouraged about how we are going to start off next year. ","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. That's really helpful. I wanted to focus on profitability in the Cabinet segment. What's driving that? And how sustainable are these levels? And I was also hoping you could just give us a little color, the 35% incremental really robust and maybe Lee could just talk about the sustainability of that. Thanks a lot and good luck.","Chris Klein","Yes, I'll talk a little bit then Lee can dive in here but it really is the result of some efficiencies coming through our manufacturing operations. We added capacity last year and when we added that we said as you bring capacity into our complex category like Cabinet, you create inefficiencies and we work through that and you could see results for that now and that is sustainable but kind of moving through the flow of production within those facilities. That's first part of it. The second part of it is mix. We continue to see a good mix coming through channels specially on the Cabinet on the dealer side of cabinet that mix continues to be strong, new products are rolling through there so those things are combining to create what we think is a pathway to mid-teens, which is what we talked about over the next couple of years. We are participating in strongest parts of the cabinet category and that's reflective of our organic business as well as the Norcraft acquisition. But if you look at our business today, 75% of the revenues are coming from the dealer channel plus the in-stock vanities and in-stock kitchen category at the home centers. So those are consistent categories where we got real structure competitive advantages so we are just leveraging that, bringing volume in across it. We are having a lot of success in the category. And I think that's translating into the volumes that you are seeing and we are executing really well on the plan so those things together create a lot of momentum. That team had a good quarter but they are having a good year and they are going to roll into 2016 really strong. Lee, maybe you can touch on just the margin and the leverage. ","Lee Wyatt","Yes, Bob. As we talked about since this spin, we moved from the beginning of the recovery to steady state which we define as roughly I mean as housing starts. We said we plan our business with incremental margins on that sales growth of about 25% to 30% would be the normal range. We are actually plan around 25%. So we've stayed on that path since the recovery started. We are still on that path. That gives us back to that steady state operating margin of 14% to 15%. So we've been on the path, we are still on the path, we think it is very sustainable when you look at the company wide in the third quarter we were incrementally run 35% for the total company. And for the year I think we will be at the high end of that 25% to 30% range. So we feel very good about that. It has been very consistent and that's how we plan and manage business. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Josh Chan with Baird. Your line is open.","Josh Chan ","Hi, good afternoon. I am wondering with the uptick in new construction whether you expect to see kind of this restocking in the plumbing wholesale channel any time in next couple of quarters. ","Chris Klein","I think we will. We haven't seen it yet. They kind of ordering to POS, so they are not destocking they are kind of running at where market is. And so we think they will probably continue that as long as until they see stronger income and I think it will be in the next quarter or two. And then we will be there to support them, we are in close contact with them and I know that with our supply chain we need just little bit of heads up to bringing in and get it assembled to shipped out for them but haven't happened yet, that's upside to us, probably the first half of 2016.","Josh Chan ","Okay, great. And my other question is about raw materials. Just basically focusing on plumbing and maybe little bit on cabinet too. How much of the margin improvement this quarter it could be attributed to maybe lower raw materials and how do you expect that variance versus price to play out over next year or so? Thanks. ","Lee Wyatt ","Yes. So our commodity inflation in the third quarter, so at the first quarter where we actually saw a net benefit versus the prior year. So in the third quarter commodity helped us somewhere over $3 million and our operating income from those commodities helped to offset some of the FX. We see similar benefit; it is built into our guidance for the full year so it is included for the fourth quarter. We haven't done our planning yet for the 2016 plan. So we will do that and when we get that done we make those assumptions, we will outline that for you when we give guidance for next year but again about $3 million this quarter should be similar to next quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim of Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Yes, thanks very much. Good quarter, guys. I wanted to ask you about your comment about the pipeline for M&A. Obviously, this has been something that we all have been watching very closely and your commentary suggest that the activity is really heating up. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for -- there maybe certain hotspots sort of particularly on the outbound, the searches that you are kind of initiating. Is there any kind of common thread to that maybe certain regions or I know product categories are probably be something. If you could just sort of talk elaborate a little bit more on what are you seeing in terms of your pipeline? ","Chris Klein","Sure. Thanks for question. I think it is really the byproduct of multiyear effort to focus on categories that are attractive. We've talked about expanding in plumbing and we've got a number of different efforts underway there, expanding both categories as well as geography. Security is another area that obviously we look at SentrySafe acquisition but we are looking at some other things there. Cabinet even, I don\u2019t expect anything soon in cabinet but multiyear efforts just across the categories that we are in. And then we look at new categories that should be for similar profile that we are in today which is not commodity building products or rather consumer home products where consumers are involved, where innovation play a key role in growth in the category where we can focus on our insights around consumer trends, consumer shopping pattern so those kind of categories are things we are looking at as well. I would just say there is just receptivity out there. I think we are into this recovery now at a sufficient pace. There is enough time that passed since the downturn that folks are open and I think it kind of sets up what could be some productive discussion. My overall metric is just level of activity because I can never predict whether any one situation is going to come to fruition. And I don't push too hard to make any one situation come to fruition. We are pretty disciplined when we look at, you can look at the things we have done already, we've been disciplined at things we have done already. What we apply that to it and I just do want us to be involved in a lot of different discussions and then for involvement right set of discussion we were disciplined, the things happen after back half so team is busy, I am busy, it's good, I think it's productive and I see good opportunities ahead of us. And we've obviously got the balance sheet capacity to able to some of these. So I think that's about all I can say right now other than the activity is strong. ","Stephen Kim","Okay. That's helpful. I guess just a follow up on that. If you could give us a sense for maybe certain things you've looked that you decided you definitely are not interested in. Are there certain kinds of characteristics of things in your pipeline or things that are out there they are not in your pipeline that you are not interested in? ","Chris Klein","Yes. I'd say things are more commodities in nature. There are some really good companies out there, private and public that is very good at managing in commodity environment which means they really are just focused on lowest cost manufacturing. And level of innovation isn't that high but they are really good at operationally driving the cost structure down. I'd say that's different from us and that we are very good operators but we also invest in innovation and we expect to get paid for that investment in innovation and we have over time that's allowed us to grow little faster than our categories. So I just say those are different mindsets and so I wouldn't have us go into commodity category where you say, wow, I can only differentiate myself and my cost structure, I can't really differentiate the product itself. There is not only strong brand there where consumers or the pro is going to differentiate based on brand. So I think there are a number of things that fall on our side and there are number of things that's fall on the other side. And I think when I say we are focused and we know we are good at, that helps us wean through those things so-","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Mike Dahl","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question I had was around the guidance and it looks like the top end of the home products growth came down a little bit to the low end of your overall sales guide came up little so organically or some combination of organic plus Norcraft increased to this. So I guess first part would be how much of that is organic versus better trends in Norcraft? And then to the extent this is organic. Where are you seeing the incremental share gains to get you to those levels? ","Lee Wyatt","Yes. So we move from 13% to 15% range to 14% to 15%. We kept Norcraft exactly where it was, we actually tight a little bit Norcraft, and we had originally said $250 million to $270 million this year. We've kind tightened that to $260 million to $270 million. So really the increase was really organically spread across much of our business units. ","Mike Dahl","Okay, great, thanks. And then the second question specifically on cabinet. I think you mentioned there was some load in helping the in-stock business, so I was just wondering if you can quantify that and how we should be thinking about it? Was it just in 3Q? Is there some of that's going to occur in 4Q and any magnitude there? Thanks.","Chris Klein","Sure. Maybe just back up on little bit when we've invested in some very strong innovation in vanities and in-stock kitchen cabinet for home centers and we were successful in getting some new placements, talked a bit about that last quarter and that we were engaged in setting the aisle with this new product. That was a tremendous amount of activity late second quarter into third quarter, that business set and rolling through, we will now be talking to POS so we will see the incremental benefit around POS as our product sale through, it's doing well in the storage. So that set up, plus there are share gains in those categories really reflecting of our competitive advantages in a way we manufacture as long as the innovation will bring into those categories. Some pretty new stuff, we are all through there in and we are fortunate that customer appreciate that and took advantage, so that really a lot of activity but we've got that and it should roll through at POS.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis McGill","Hi, thank you. Chris, I was hoping to -- I guess as you look at performance so far this year, at least on our numbers, it seems like there's pretty clear share gains across the building products business as a whole. I know that's always been a hallmark for you. I was hoping you could maybe just talk about now where you're seeing the most share gains. Maybe put a little bit more behind -- you've touched on cabinets, but whether that's channel or product categories across the portfolio and then where you're most optimistic as you look into 2016 in the same regard?","Chris Klein","Yes. I think if I look at the three businesses I start with cabinet I think we are clearly seeing growth above the market in the dealer channel. And so that part of the market very strong organic growth. And I think that's just stepped up relationship selling more product into exiting relationships continuing to take share and bringing in new dealership. So that's pretty consistent but it is picking up I think Norcraft products will continue to help us on that front. This in-stock kitchen and vanities part, we are going faster than the market there. So those are really that 75% of the cabinet business where we are seeing the most momentum in share gain. On the Moen side, within plumbing we are seeing good growth in retail. We have put in some new product placements and those are selling through quite well. Wholesale continues to grow slightly above where market is so that's good especially in the mix side; we are selling richer mix through on the wholesale and the plumbing side in general. So that picks some and then our entry towards, we expanding some distribution on last couple of years especially out west and there is quite a bit of activity out there and as we brought in new products, new glass style, again our mix is improving so our new accounts improving out there so all sets up strong and then comes to back kind of as the market grows, we should continue that momentum coming through the system. So I am really happy with where the business sit here, I think we've done a lot specially over the last year and half and we are seeing that flow through second half of 2015 and really into 2016.","Dennis McGill","And with respect to cabinet and dealer channel, now you have Norcraft for five moths or so, are you seeing anything along the lines of either cannibalization or opportunity on the cross sale side and the dealer side?","Chris Klein","Yes. Its multiyear effort on the sale side so when we talk about the acquisition we said on the cross side we get off to real quick we have and that looks good. And on the sale side, it is a multiyear effort to bring some of their products into our existing dealers and bring some of our products into that dealership network. That has started but it is really a ramp up in 2016 and 2017. So tend to a lot of work together so no cannibalization I think just the early stuff is going to be dealers who frankly want the products that's out there and like the product and they take them into the market right now around frameless, and now we've got multiple lines, multiple brand, lot of innovation going on there across both the Norcraft portfolio and our organic portfolio. So we are taking kind of proper low hanging fruit first where there is real demand and we are doing lot planning to figure out where we are going to drive the hard in 2016 and so it is all going according to plan I did probably going better just because collaboration is really terrific, great culture, great people on both sides and coming together well, so that's kind of easy to say but you are just going to see working well together, we get pretty excited about that everything we thought would have just going to happen in early returns of it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Ken Zener","Good afternoon, gentlemen. Cabinet, very good at 10% organic and not to take away from the success you had there. But I was looking back at Norcraft sales last year and if I take I think 23% acquisition growth that you had. This quarter it kind of implied a 4% growth rate for Norcraft, Lee and if you could help me with those numbers, that's how I calculated it. Is there some reason that if that's accurate there was slower growth there, was there -- was there something going on there because you obviously grew nicely overall.","Chris Klein","Yes, I know. The calculation is different because we changed the number of weeks in months from what they had so there is a math problem. So they actually grew the same as the cabinet business organically so they were good. But it's just when we put them into our system, we use a different number of months in a quarter so in any given number weeks in a months so it's just the math difference but they grew well. ","Ken Zener","Okay, just wanted to clarify that. Plumbing, commodity costs are down. Can you talk about beyond the incremental volume leverage? What we are seeing in terms of lower input costs; give us some context for that if you would and how that can be tailwind above and beyond the volume?","Lee Wyatt ","Yes. So commodity cost and commodity inflation for us, first half of the year was generally flat and in places like cabinets the kind of wood we use we actually saw little inflation in the first half. There is other place we've seen inflation like glass, so third quarter was the first quarter where we actually saw a benefit net versus prior year and that was between $3 million and $4 million. We think that -- and we have planned in our guidance as we gave guidance last quarter. We assumed there is going to be similar benefits in the fourth quarter. So we build that in to our guidance. As we think about 2016, we will go through those calculations, we will see where the market is for commodities at that point and we will build that into our guidance for 2016, we will give you that, to you that in early February when we give our full year guidance but it has been positive this quarter. ","Ken Zener","And does this focus -- I mean obviously if you are facing inflation on cabinet, I assume you are facing a lot of cost input deflation in plumbing given the commodity inputs there the metals. Could you -- when you look forward I mean it seem like it is disproportionately benefiting plumbing, would that be an accurate? And how is that impacting perhaps in the overall market? Thank you very much. ","Lee Wyatt","Yes. So when you look at plumbing operating margin 19.5% last year, we think it will be around 20% this year. It is getting marginal benefit, it is a few million dollars in the quarter from Moen, it is a few million dollars for the second half of Moen, and Moen's operating margins are so strong that's not driven by commodity benefit. It is a small piece of it. It is just they are positioning the market in their competitive advantages that are driving those kind of operating margin so -- ","Chris Klein","And the mix is frankly a bigger part of that. We started improving that mix over the last two years. And we have seen an increasing pace of mix improvement which is consumer trading up within the category to higher price points which had better margin so that's specially prevalent in wholesale where we are trading up and we can see it just in every sales price per unit. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie Security Group. Your line is open.","Mike Wood ","Hi, thanks for take my question. You talked about richer mix in plumbing. Are you giving any higher ASP in cabinets from your new products and is the cabinets industry seeing any like to like price increases given how the demand has been strengthening?","Chris Klein","Yes. We are. On the mix side seeing good mix coming through on the dealer side, semi-custom to the higher end custom, I talked a little bit about frameless, and how strong that's been selling through, the new products that we bring in are selling strong so mix overall is continue to improve in cabinets especially in the dealer side of the business. And to certain extent on special order and home services as well. So it is all positive. In terms of pricing, there is actually a reasonably healthy pricing environment and has been for last couple of years on the cabinet side and expect that could likely continue.","Mike Wood ","Thanks. And then just an administrative question, I may have missed this, the one time charges from the capacity expansion and plumbing in the quarter, can you remind me what that was and if you're expecting the same thing for fourth quarter?","Lee Wyatt ","Yes. So just to recap the year, we basically said we have about $0.06 to $0.07 of EPS cost this year for investments in that. We said Moen would be about $0.04 of the $0.06 to $0.07. We got a couple of cents in the first half; we get a couple of cents in the second half from Moen. I think we had a penny or so in the third quarter, so that's built into our guidance. It has been consistent all year and really hasn't changed. So it is built-in.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over the presenters.","Brian Lantz","Thank you very much. We would like to thank everyone for attending our quarterly call today.

Following our prepared remarks, we will allow some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our results for the second quarter and feel confident in delivering the strong performance we have targeted for the year. Our teams delivered solid results overall, which was again on plan and met our overall expectations. The momentum inside of our Plumbing and Doors businesses continues to be very strong. Our Cabinet transition is going well and we took concrete actions to accelerate the repositioning of the business.","Across the company, price increases continue to roll through all segments and are countering the increased material and labor costs we saw in the first half. Our progress in these areas positions us well for stronger operating leverage in the second half of 2018 and into 2019. In addition to our financial results, we successfully executed a number of important actions to set up the business for a stronger second half and longer-term growth. I'll have more to say on these strategic steps in a moment.","Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next, I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the second quarter. Pat will then provide more details on our second quarter performance and 2018 outlook.","Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market; in the second quarter, the market for our home products grew at about the pace we planned. Market growth was better than the prior quarter despite a slower start to the second quarter due to wet and cold weather coming out of the first quarter.","We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew close to 5% and that new construction grew high-single digits, roughly in line with our full year expectation. New construction and R&R activity picked up throughout the second quarter. And the second half is setting up to be stronger than the first half with demand remaining strong and builders and contractors working against solid backlogs.","Now, let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the second quarter, sales increased 5% in total. Total company operating margin was solid at 14.6%, but lower year-over-year as inflationary pressures were a headwind in all segments as we expected. Operating margin is expected to improve as we move through the year as our prices actions typically lag inflation by six to nine months and we've now rolled through price increases in all segments.","Turning to the segments beginning with Plumbing; the Global Plumbing Group continues to perform as envisioned with low-double digit sales growth at our target 21% operating margin. For the last five quarters in a row, we have delivered above-market organic sales growth while maintaining industry-leading margins, a clear sign that the strategy is working. Results in both our core businesses and new platforms continue to be outstanding, and we're actively investing in new routes to market, digital capabilities and the product portfolio.","For example, we recently formed a new dedicated hospitality and project sales team, bringing together sales professionals from our acquired and legacy plumbing businesses with a full suite of products and brands across price points. This team has already won incremental business that is shipping this year and has developed a significant pipeline into 2019 of double-digit millions in sales. It is an example of true synergy created by the GPG platform, as our more recently acquired brands like ROHL and Riobel are paving the way for access to the whole portfolio.","Additionally, we've been leveraging our enhanced digital and analytic capabilities and are using those insights to bring new growth opportunities to our customers. This data has been informing our product, pricing and channel decisions, primarily in retail and e-commerce.","Lastly, we're accelerating the pace of our innovation. We've rolled out new product categories, including disposals and water filtration in select markets, introduced matte black, gold and other new finishes, and integrated some of our smart products with virtual voice commanded assistance.","Sales from new products launched in the last three years now total about 25% of overall sales and we continue to pursue engineering, design, and productivity improvements to push this number to 30% over the next three years.","So, in Plumbing, we're off to a very strong start to the year and are carrying good momentum into the second half. POS was strong in the quarter, and some channel partners exited the quarter with lower inventory which could be a slight tailwind for us moving forward. We will continue to position our Plumbing business for accelerated growth consistent with our strategy.","Our $1.7 billion Plumbing business is very much on track to grow sales organically and through acquisitions to our targeted $3 billion by 2021. With industry-leading operating margins at around 21%, the platform should drive about 60% of our total company operating profit growth over the next three-plus years.","In Doors, our performance accelerated as we continued to take share in the door market. Our growth strategy and focused approach drove strong double digit growth through both the wholesale and retail channels. In wholesale, we continued to convert new builders, particularly in geographies with strong new construction activity in the South and West. We're pressing our advantage in fiberglass with new product launches and leveraging our national fabricator network.","In retail, our high service levels, leading product quality and strong multi-year performance has compounded our growth in the channel. Special order sales continued to strong and in-stock sales tied to our remerchandising efforts in the aisle have exceeded our initial expectations. Across our channels, innovation is driving a stronger cadence of new product introductions. Increased focus on regional styling and a more contemporary lineup has helped grow our sales.","In the Security business, our core U.S. retail sales grew 5% in total and we lapped the last quarter of a commercial business line we exited in the prior year. Price lagged metal inflation in the quarter, but is expected to reverse in the second half as shipments now reflect the full impact of our pricing actions.","Turning to the combination of Doors and Security, on the last call, we stated our intent to grow the Doors business more aggressively, both through acquisition opportunities and new internal initiatives. At the end of the quarter, we internally announced our plan to combine the leadership of our Doors and Security units into a single segment under our Doors leader, Brett Finley. Starting in the third quarter, this will be a division with roughly $1.2 billion in annual sales and operating margin approaching 16%, with the potential to grow organically to over $1.4 billion in sales and a margin approaching 18% over the next 3.5 years.","As we make progress towards these targets, this new structure will give us additional operating leverage across the businesses. We should also see greater capacity for growth through accelerated product development and enhanced acquisition integration capabilities, similar to what we've created with a common back office inside of the Global Plumbing Group.","Brett is an outstanding leader, who's driven strong results across the Door segment over the last 2.5 years. He'll create a common platform with newly enhanced scale that can more effectively leverage investments, talent, and innovation across a larger business unit. I am confident in Brett's ability to grow and create value through the new structure, and we'll begin reporting results for the combined segment next quarter.","Turning to Cabinets; early in the year, we provided more clarity on our plan to strategically pivot our Cabinet business. Throughout the year, we've been executing against our plan with a number of impactful steps still to come. To give you some context around our actions, we began the year with 27 cabinet manufacturing facilities across North America. Four that manufactured premium cabinets, eight producing mid-tier semi-custom cabinets, and the remaining 15 supporting our value semi-custom, stock and in-stock cabinets and vanity businesses.","In the quarter, we took actions to further align our supply chain against our strategy. Specifically, we responded to some softness in the segments of the cabinet market and consolidated our footprint of plants that manufacturer mid-tier semi-custom cabinets, closing two of the eight plants that produced these products. We redirected the volume at these price points over the strongest of our remaining six plants to generate greater operating leverage going forward.","At the same time, we undertook a set of actions to increase capacity and launch new products in areas where we are experiencing growth including in-stock cabinets and vanities, decorative laminate veneer products for builders, and value semi-custom cabinetry at affordable price points. These actions included expanding our in-stock cabinets and vanities footprint in Mexico and Texas by ramping up a new manufacturing facility and expanding several existing facilities, expanding capacity of our existing builder stock and DLV facilities in the Midwest and Carolinas, and adding to our automated paint capacity in value semi-custom.","We will continue to take aggressive actions over the next four quarters as we execute on our pivot strategy, which will add tangible value to the business in the second half of this year and into 2019. These actions will position us to resume margin expansion beginning next year and provide the setup for continued expansion over the next three to four years as we drive a healthier, more predictable mix of business through our industry-leading dealer network, our large homecenter partners, and key builder relationships.","With the significant capabilities and ability we have to flex our supply chains and the improvements to our cost structure and margin from the actions we took in the second quarter, we're making solid progress down the path we laid out in May to achieve 14% operating margin by 2021 with consistent mid-single digit sales growth.","So, to recap the second quarter, it was solid overall with mid-single digit sales growth and nearly double digit EPS growth even as inflation continued to run ahead of price in the quarter. Despite these headwinds, the pricing and other actions we've taken to offset inflation are on track and we're well positioned to see the benefit of margin expansion as the year unfolds.","We also took important strategic steps to position us well for the second half and longer term, especially in our Cabinets business. I'm very encouraged with the progress we have made in the quarter in our Cabinets pivot plan. And regarding the combination of our Doors and Security businesses, this change will position us to deliver a new level of innovation, acquisition capabilities and profitability to this part of our portfolio for years to come.","Before I wrap up, let me review our capital deployment in the quarter and our broader plan to create long-term incremental value. Year-to-date through July, we've spent over $600 million on share repurchases for about 10 million shares so far in 2018. As we announced in a press release last week, we have remaining authorization for another $500 million in repurchases. So, we feel good about our 2018 outlook and are comfortable with our plans to drive value over the next three years. We're maintaining our current sales outlook and increasing our EPS outlook based on share repurchase activity.","While we see significant value in FBHS shares, we also remain very active in exploring potential acquisitions. We are currently engaged in discussions with potential acquisition targets and are working on a robust pipeline of opportunities that we see coming to market in the next 12 months. While we do not have anything to announce today, we'll provide further commentary as the second half of the year unfolds.","As a reminder, over the next three years, we continue to believe that we have the power to deploy an additional $3 billion to $4 billion to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase additional shares and increase our dividend to create meaningful incremental shareholder value.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Pat, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our EPS outlook for 2018.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Starting with our second quarter results, sales were $1.4 billion, up 5% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $209 million, down 2% or $3 million compared to the same quarter last year as inflation was a headwind as expected.","Total company operating margin of 14.6% was in line with Q2 expectations. We remain well-positioned to deliver our 2018 outlook as operating margin and leverage accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by pricing and continued progress in our Cabinets pivot.","EPS were $1 in the quarter versus $0.92 the same quarter last year, an increase of 9% and in line with our Q2 expectations. Our progress through the first half of the year has been solid and consistent with our plan. We continue to expect our results to be back half weighted with significant year-over-year EPS growth in the third quarter and especially into four quarter.","Now, let me provide more color on segment results beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $484 million, up $49 million or 11%. Our GPG strategy is driving solid growth across channels, and we saw especially strong growth in U.S. wholesale, China and the acquired businesses in the quarter. Our organic sales continue to outpace the market as sales excluding acquisitions were up 9%. This demonstrates our strategy for the new Plumbing platform, continues to produce strong results even in a quarter where some channel partners pulled down inventory.","Plumbing operating income was flat at $101 million with an operating margin of 20.9%, in line with our strategy for this business. Year-to-date Plumbing operating margin is also about 21% and consistent with the first half of 2017 despite significant inflation.","Doors sales were $160 million, up $27 million or 20% from the prior-year quarter, driven by strong sales growth with big builders and share gains at retail. Operating income increased $5 million and was up 24%. Operating margin for the segment was 17.5%, a 60-basis-point increase from the prior year as strong sales leverage and pricing offset inflation in this business.","Security sales were $147 million in the second quarter, up 3% versus the prior year. Sales were solid in our core U.S. retail locks and safes businesses. Segment operating income was down $2 million, due to metals inflation and the time lag associated with pricing actions taken in the retail channel. Heading into the third quarter, we have been successful in implementing price across all channels and are on track for second half and full year margin improvement.","In Cabinets, sales for the second quarter were $638 million, down $16 million or 2% versus the prior-year quarter. Excluding the select homecenter and low margin Canadian business exits, Cabinet sales were up 1%. Excluding business exits, sales of in-stock cabinets and vanities grew mid-single digits on continued solid demand for these products.","Builder sales were up low-single digits and were impacted by a slow start to the quarter due to weather in the Midwest and East where we have a significant portion of our business. Dealer sales increased 1% and saw a modest uptick in premium from the prior year. Homecenter special order sales were down, reflecting the impact of our planned pullback on promotions. Sales in Canada were up 6% as the changes we made in the business last year began to deliver benefits.","In Cabinets, we anticipated a year of transition as we executed the structural changes outlined in our pivot plan. These significant improvement initiatives executed during the second quarter have improved our cost structure and began having a margin impact. Operating income in the quarter was $81 million, down 8% and operating margin was 12.7%. While lower on a year-over-year basis, these results represent substantial improvement from Q1 and are in line with the plan to get the business to 14% operating margin by 2021. Our pivot execution is off to a good start. We expect further improvement in the second half as additional operational improvements and pricing drive margin improvement.","To sum up consolidated second quarter performance, sales increased 5% and EPS were in line with our expectation at $1. We are positioned well for a strong second half and full year. Our Plumbing and Doors businesses continue to outperform the industry and we have taken the pricing and strategic steps necessary to accelerate our performance through the balance of the year and into 2019.","Turning to the balance sheet, our June 30th balance sheet remains solid with cash of $345 million, debt of $2.1 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 2.1 times. We currently have $350 million remaining on our $1.25 billion revolver and we continue to have substantial capacity and flexibility to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases.","Year-to-date, we have repurchased over 10 million shares for approximately $600 million. Our approach to share repurchase continues to be opportunistic and focused on where we can generate significant returns. We have approximately $500 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2018; as Chris mentioned, we are increasing our 2018 EPS outlook to the range of $3.62 to $3.72 versus $3.08 last year. Due to first half business performance in line with our expectation, pricing actions taken, progress in our Cabinet pivot, and our share repurchase activity, we are encouraged by the positive demand signals we continue to see in the U.S. housing market and our business performance.","We expect 2018 free cash flow of $500 million to $525 million with a conversion rate of over 90%. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $68 million; a tax rate of approximately 25%; and average fully diluted shares of approximately 147 million.","In summary, our teams did an excellent job navigating the inflationary environment and have positioned us well for a strong second half. Demand indicators remain strong and we delivered solid sales and earnings despite inflation headwinds and a weather-slowed start to the year. We also remain well positioned to use our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian C. Lantz - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks, Pat. That concludes our prepared remarks for the second quarter of 2018. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions. Since there may be a number of you that would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Macquarie.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to start, could you give us some more color on what you're seeing in your end markets and some of the actions you've taken that gives you confidence that second half sales growth will pick up and margins will improve?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Sure. I'd start with taking care of our own house. We did a tremendous amount of work first half of the year, second quarter, talked through the actions we've taken in Cabinets, pricing action really across every part of our business, and we're seeing that impact now and we're going to see more of that coming into the second half.","We see good demand flowing through the channels. You saw results in terms of growth; Plumbing very strong, Doors strong, and markets look good. I'd say coming out of the first quarter into the second quarter things were a little slow in the Northeast, Midwest, but they started picking up late-April and the whole country is progressing nicely. The West and South continue to be strong.","And then, just we look out in terms of overall drivers across the markets. We come in a little later in the building process and there's quite a bit of backlog out there both on new construction as well as R&R contractors, and kitchen and bath designers. They're full and they've got a lot of activity that's going to come through here. So, it's going to be a busy second half. We're well positioned. We did a lot of work in the first six, seven months of the year. So we're feeling pretty good right now just based on the progress and the impact of all the things that we've done.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then just switching to Cabinets, can you give some numbers around the annual savings you expect from the restructuring you've done year-to-date?","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","What I would say, Adam, is we expect operating margins for the back half of the year to be about 12% on average across the back half of the year and we expect once we get through this year to be making progress at about 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year from now through 2021. Through the second quarter, specifically, there have been a number of puts and takes. We weren't just taking costs out, we were investing in portions of the business that were growing. So I put the second quarter more in context of some sequential seasonal growth.","If you look at the last five years in the Cabinets business, you've tended to see about a 550-basis-point margin step up from Q1 to Q2 based on seasonality and, this year, you're seeing about 850 basis points. And that among the actions we can see in terms of hitting and over-delivering OI forecast on a monthly basis give us the confidence we're on the right track in that business, we'll deliver a strong back half of the year, and we've put ourselves on track for the 14% margin.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to focus the first one on plumbing and there's clearly a lot of moving pieces on the cost dynamics, both in terms of the inflation that you've incurred versus pricing dynamics, then looking at what could potentially come down the pipe in terms of tariffs, then also seeing things like copper rollover. Could you just help us kind of walk through how you expect all of this to unfold from a price, cost and margin standpoint in Plumbing over the next few quarters?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Sure. I'd go all the way back to third quarter, late third quarter, fourth quarter last year, copper metals rising in the Plumbing business. We saw that coming at us and started taking pricing action in the first half of the year, and that really kind of matched up against what we saw in terms of input cost inflation. And there's a bit of a lag there. So, we've got components coming in, we assemble here in the U.S., and so we were adding value here in the U.S. as well. So there's a piece of it that's tied directly to component inflation and there's a piece of it that's under our own control.","And so, we've matched that up. We were aggressive coming out. And I think \u2013 and as you can see, our target's 21%, we hit 21%, and that's inclusive of the investments we're making in the business to drive innovation, marketing, branding, data analytics. So there's a lot behind that. So we're in a good cadence.","In terms of looking out into the future, metals have backed off a bit. We'll get the benefit of that as we kind of come in, but we're still working through, obviously, inventory that we've got in the system. And in terms of future tariffs, I can't speculate on what those tariffs are going to be and how they're going to unfold. We'll manage it. We'll manage it through a combination of supply chain, as I said, we add content here in the U.S., and through pricing actions.","And so, we've been able to address those increased costs through a combination of all those actions to this point. That 21% margin's pretty solid. That's where we expect the balance of the year. So it's right on strategy. So, we're feeling like we have the ability to handle what comes at us and move pieces both in terms of pricing as well as supply chain to address it. So, we're kind of dealing in this uncertainty for a little while already and I think we've navigated it quite successfully.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, certainly. Great. And shifting gears to the combination of Doors and Security. It seems like there's a couple things going on here that you're trying to set up this business for, and one of them seems akin to when you set up GPG and have started to roll in some acquisitions and kind of build out some multi-brand strategies and such underneath that umbrella and, clearly, that's driven some tremendous results.","So I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on kind of what you see. I know you laid out some of the long-term financials there, but just what you see as the opportunities both from an organic product development standpoint, a little more detail there. And just seems like maybe there's going to be some increased focus on M&A in that combined segment. And what type of assets are you looking for there?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, terrific observation. I think the parallel is quite strong. First of all, we're taking kind of our two smaller businesses, bringing it under a terrific leader in Brett Finley. You've seen the results in Doors. I don't have to explain kind of how strong he is given his leadership of what was already a great business, and you look at what we've done in the last 2.5 years in terms of share and margin expansion.","There is some scale benefit. So we took our two smaller groups, bringing it together, there'll be some scale benefits in a stronger common back office team. That will help accelerate some of the organic product development and really drive some more revenue momentum there. But it also, as you point out, will set up our ability to take on acquisitions and really bring them in house in a more efficient way.","We could do it under the old structure, but it's just we've got a bit more leverage. We found that in GPG having kind of that stronger common group has allowed us to bring in a series of those acquisitions and they kind of hit the ground running and now we've combined some capabilities.","We are looking at some things in that segment, so some combination of things in that door exterior product and security. There is some crossover in terms of we literally had separate engineering teams working on connected security products through both the door platform as well as portable security, safe security. And so combining that horsepower, that engineering capability is going to bring us some benefit and just allow us to accelerate some of those things, form some partnerships and do some things.","So, those worlds were coming together. This should enable what was coming at us in any way. But it'll set up some good future organic and acquisition growth. So, we think it's going to come together nicely. Terrific leadership team, across both those businesses, we've got a lot of talented people. So, we're going to be really bringing together some strong capabilities, and you'll get some scale leverage just by bringing that together. It will be a $1.2 billion segment that compares to Cabinets, which is about $2.5 billion, Plumbing, which is moving toward $2 billion, so you'll have kind of three big healthy, scalable business segments.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's really helpful color. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","Hey, guys. Appreciate you taking the time.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Sure.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","Just a follow-up on the combination of the two segments. Can you articulate what kind of maybe revenue and cost synergies you're planning? I know you're mapping towards an intermediate term goal, but in the near term, any kind of synergy that you're going to call out for that combination?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","I'd just say it's going to \u2013 as we look at kind of how it's going to evolve, putting them together, you'll see running it will be roughly 16% margin business. They have similar margin profiles to start. And it'll get us, on a combined basis, to about 18% operating margin over the next two, three years.","So, I'm not going to break out kind of specific leverage within there, but it'll allow us to get to those kind of margin expansion numbers with probably a little bit more certainty and a little bit more speed. And then it'll allow us to bring acquisitions underneath that and leverage that set of capabilities, so you're going to get some synergy in terms of cost leverage on acquisitions, which is exactly what we see in Plumbing, which is you've got a stronger common back platform you can bring things in, in terms of brands and products and ride off of that, and you get some good cost synergies right out of the gate. So it's a combination of all those things.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","Thank you. And I wanted to turn my attention or turn everyone's attention to the Plumbing business. You put up a very large first half comp, well above market demand at 12%, double digits, and when you see a 15% comp in the first quarter, it begs the question is there channel fill, is there going to be a pull-ahead risk, but then you put up a 9% in the second quarter and then you characterized it. I think you said channel partners have lower inventories in the quarter. Just help maybe provide context of how you get into the channel, and I understand the inventory situation, but also what's going on with this great growth that you're putting up.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","I guess step back and I'll take the first part of it which is just a lot of investment in capabilities. We've got the acquisitions that are working and coming together. That team was significantly enhanced in the first nine, 12 months of forming the GPG back in 2016; and so a lot of that product innovation, branding work, marketing, data analytics. There were investments going on that you're starting to see that impact flowing through.","The acquisitions have worked well and they've worked well not just individually but in concert, bringing out the concept of the House of Rohl, which is a combination of those luxury brands. But we're also paving the way into hospitality and project work.","And I'd say, you think about the old Moen business, terrific business, big work house of the company, strong profit generator, but it was really at the heart of the market and that was where the brand lived, and you couldn't as significantly penetrate a lot of that project work and hospitality work. Now, we've got greater entr\u00e9e into those designers and architects and we're starting the conversation to open up the whole suite. So you're seeing a lot of that play through and you continue to see that growing.","We're investing. As I've talked about the 21% margin, you could see some margin expansion except for the fact that we're investing for the growth. And so that's a very conscious investment dynamic and margin management so that you're kind of feeding that growth and we've got to make sure we're getting it back or you might see a little bit of that margin expansion.","Your second point around inventory, Pat, maybe you can just handle kind of how \u2013 you're right and my comment was that there was a little bit of leaning out. So, it didn't go the other way, it went toward a little bit of leaning out and Pat maybe you can talk...","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Justin, on the U.S. and Canada, while we can't see POS and inventory from all of our customers, we can see POS and inventory from our biggest customers with regular frequency and so we can see our POS running at or above sales. And we can see inventory levels on a weeks' basis being very healthy and, in some cases, down below where they would traditionally be.","So we feel good that this is underlying POS driven growth. And then we've seen in China very strong growth both from share gains and from product portfolio expansion and the businesses that we've owned for over a year, in particular, Riobel is raging ahead very successfully. So, it's all those things combined that allow us to feel good that this is just strong underlying growth, and it continues beyond the second quarter and it's really part of the third quarter. So we feel good about the second half of the year.","Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman Partners LLC","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. First question I had is, across the earnings season, so far cost inflation and price recovery continues to be one of the central themes. And I believe you said in your prepared remarks that both of these items remain on track with your earlier expectations. And I just wanted to confirm that and kind of, by component, what we've seen predominately with most of the companies is higher-than-expected cost inflation as the years progressed so far, and as a result incremental price increases and price recovery actions.","I was curious if you saw that as well in your business in the different raw mats that impact your different segments or if, by contrast, cost inflation kind of remains where you thought it would be a quarter ago and you haven't had to take any incremental pricing actions against that.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Sure. And I'd just say that's something that hit us to start \u2013 really started to come at us in the fourth quarter of last year. So, if you think about plywood tariffs and kind of the core brass and some of the Plumbing cost inflations came at us maybe a little sooner than other parts of the building products segment. So we kind of got off on this stuff hard, fast, early, and so we started taking pricing action later in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter, and then, yes, there was some continued acceleration, and so we've had to take incremental. But, I'd say, we worked our way through a chunk of it already and then took some incremental.","And it wasn't just pricing, we're also working supply chain and pulling some other levers. So, I don't know specifically what's driving other categories that we're not in, but I'd say, for us, we took it seriously, took it hard, took it early, and worked it and continue to do that, but that's kind I think what's allowed us to, let's say, keep pace. We are going to get more levers in the second half and maybe, Pat, you can give a little bit of the color on that.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yes. Mike, what we're trying to convey throughout our release and our script in terms of expectations is we knew going into the year, even before some of the inflation came in, additional inflation that came in in the first quarter, that our first half inflation would exceed price and the back half price would exceed inflation. That was in our plan. And while we don't give quarterly guidance, we even signaled at the end of the first quarter call that that would be the circumstance in the second quarter, that inflation would exceed price, and that is certainly what happened.","I would give you the context and we usually talk about inflation in terms of EPS. Our plan would have called for inflation in the area of $0.25 to $0.30 for the full year and, most certainly, there's been more inflation, both commodities and logistics, than we expected. It's probably more like $0.45 to $0.50 for the year, and that's in our guidance, but we've taken incremental price. You'll see about 70% of our price come in the back half of the year; our net realized price will come in the back half of the year. And for the back half of the year, we will cover \u2013 our run rate will cover inflation and, even for the full year, we still expect to cover inflation with price so the margin by which we cover it will be much tighter.","And all this is in our guidance. I think our teams have done a great job monitoring the situation very closely, working with channel partners, and working inside their organizations and, as Chris said, not just to take price, but to pull other levers, whether it's material substitution or other cost savings. But this has been an area where we've been working since the latter part of last year and pretty much on a continual basis through present day with some of the last increases kind of going in at the end of the second quarter and really part of third quarter.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","And it's not a \u2013 part of what the dialog was back in January and in April on the calls and with investors is we saw this coming; it was in our early numbers, it was in all of our activities, we were working it. And so we maybe just have benefited that some of this stuff hit us in our sectors a little earlier, so we were forced to get on it. But we continue to press all the levers we've got.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate that and very helpful some incremental color there. I guess, secondly, it seems like most of your businesses, as you've kind of said \u2013 stated, are on track, your expectations for the quarter are on track and it feels like that's kind of by segment, you can apply that statement.","Just perhaps slightly more granular, but you increased your EPS guidance by a few pennies. You actually lowered your operating cash flow guidance by about $5 million. So just wanted to get a sense of what was driving both of those. I don't know if the EPS was from a share count perspective, if operating it's either \u2013 because it would seem like most of your margin expectations are in place by segment. So just trying to get a sense of those two full year guidance changes, albeit slight, what's driving each of them.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. For the most part, you're correct in understanding the EPS raise is driven by the incremental share repurchase activity. So the incremental share repurchase activity that we've had since the first quarter call would \u2013 net of interest expense, would give you about $0.03, maybe $0.04, and so that's what we've put into the guidance. And the midpoint of the guidance went from $3.64 to $3.67, that's the primary driver. The change in the cash flow outlook of roughly about $25 million mostly a tax timing item that has become somewhat uncertain just around some of the new behavior in the treasury; modest change to other operating dynamics, but it's mostly timing of around a tax item.","And what I would say on our full year outlook is we still see the market being strong. We still see U.S. housing 5% to 7%, global markets 5% to 6%. We still see our sales growth 6% to 7% as we stated our EPS growth in the range of $3.62 to $3.72. And our OI margin improvement, our initial guidance was roughly 50 basis points, we're probably in the 30 basis points to 50 basis points range just based on some of the inflation with the benefit from the share gains. But that, I would say, should tighten up the guidance for you, Mike.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. The restructuring effort in Cabinets seems to have progressed quite well. If there were any big hurdles on the operational front, is that pretty much behind you and can you now pivot to focus more on the commercial front so you track more in line with the broader market on Cabinets?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yes. It's a combination of things. I think we have been growing in those segments of the market that we're targeting, so in-stock cabinets, vanities, some parts of the builder business, the value part of the business, the West and the South have been quite strong, so all that is underlying, at the same time, kind of pulling back from some of this mid-tier business, which hasn't been as strong. So, we're down that road. You will see better revenue performance in the second half out of the Cabinet group, and so that is part of what the plan is and is flowing through as we're looking at orders in the first part of the quarter. July orders look strong.","So I think you will start to see that flow through very much consistent with what we laid out in May as the overall pivot, which is focusing on those parts of the marketplace that we see growing. Lining up ourselves against that, we've already got a good portion of that business. We're expanding some capacity there and we're expanding some capacity in Mexico in some value parts of our supply chain so that's got very strong leverage. And there's good profitability in those segments of the market. There's more automation, more kind of a cost supply chain or standardization. So we get great leverage in that part of the market.","So, yes, you'll see good commercial progress on that side, and then we'll be rolling some additional product out against those growing segments, and that'll be not just back half of this year, but into next year. So we're focused on driving that mid-single digit growth as well as moving the margin up to 14% over the next three years, and we're on track. I'm comfortable. That team has done a tremendous amount of work.","When we were shutting plants down back in 2008, 2009, you weren't as concerned about keeping customer service levels high, doing that work and maintaining that front-end of the business. When we're in the kind of market we're in today where there's still a lot of demand out there. We've been fairly methodical in making sure that we keep that service level high. And as we're progressing and moving capacity around that were gently handing off a lot of that service to other parts of our network. So they've done an outstanding job in doing that and we're set up for a good second half, we're set up for a good 2019, but there's a lot more things that they're still moving against, both on supply chain as well as on the front end with product.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","That's great and, Chris, you touched upon this a little bit already, but with the potential tariffs, can you talk about the potential impact you could see on your different businesses, whether it's Plumbing or Cabinets and how can you manage that? And does that potentially make your product a bit more competitive relative to imports, particularly on the Cabinet side of things? Thanks.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. I guess things will unfold as they'll unfold. We've dealt with what's come at us already and we've already had some hits in terms of plywood and some steel and other things that have been input costs to us. And we've dealt with that through a combination of pricing and supply chain. And I'd say, in general, from a \u2013 we're a big U.S. manufacturer. We're a big North American manufacturer. And so we've got a good North American set of capabilities. We add value in North America, we add value in the U.S., we're a big assembler; we do fully integrated manufacturing in parts of our business. So that works to our advantage across big chunks of the portfolio, especially in Cabinets.","I'd say other parts where you've got components coming in, there is a China element to our supply chain and we'll see how that unfolds and we'll react to it as it unfolds. So, beyond that, we've been able to deal with what's come at us in a pretty significant way already and we'll see how this plays out throughout the fall. But I think, relative to those who are making a lot of finished goods in China and shipping them in, we're in a better place because we can move some componentry around and continue to add a lot of value in the U.S. as part of that supply chain. There's also a bit of a lag in terms of how this plays through the businesses. Supply chains coming out of Asia are longer, so you've got a bit of time to react to how they're flowing through.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hello.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","My first question is \u2013 yeah, can you hear me?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, I can hear you. Hi.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Perfect. My first question is around there's been a lot of talk around the elasticity of demand in building products and, certainly, your results this quarter show that you can continue to get price while keeping the top line pretty healthy. But it'd be great to get your perspective on that. How do you think about your \u2013 looking out, your pricing power and ability to continue to cover some of the inflation that could come through?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","I think it depends on the parts of our business. I'd start by saying we're leaders in our category, we've got strong brands, we've got strong positions in our markets, and so we're already in that strong leadership position. I think then you can move through the categories. I think, in Plumbing, you've got really strong brand position, a lot of innovation coming through, and so we can take price and we have taken price.","It isn't unlimited. I think there is a point where you'll get pushback to the channels, which is why you've got to be also working supply chain in concert with that and you've got to be deliberate and take a little bit along the way as opposed to just taking big bites all at once. And so that's what we've been trying to do across that business.","I think in the Door market, there's an interesting dynamic between steel and fiberglass and we're much bigger in fiberglass. We do have a steel product line as well, but there there's a crossover point when steel rises and you have to price that up to the bottom end of fiberglass. Given a choice between the bottom end of fiberglass and the high end of steel, both builders, contractors and consumers would prefer the fiberglass' better performance. If you close that gap a little tighter then it carries over and you're seeing more growth in the fiberglass side of the portfolio. So that's an elasticity phenomenon that actually works to our advantage.","Across cabinetry, you've seen kind of the middle part of the market and we talked about the pivot, and that's really kind of some elasticity in the middle part of the market with some demand growing in the value semi-custom and more of the stock part of that market. At the high end of the market, there's still a good premium part of that market, and we're taking price across that continuum, but I'd say the consumer behavior is disfavoring that middle part. But, on the other two parts of the portfolio, we've taken price across cabinets all the way from the in-stock product all the way up through premium, but again, you take it kind of in increment across that.","And then in our Security part of the market, again, strong brand, Master Lock. We've taken it both on the retail and commercial side. And so it's not unlimited what you can take there, but we've taken what we need to take to offset those input costs. So I'd say, if you've got strong brand, strong market positions, you're in good place to take it, I think you've got to be deliberate about it and you've got to work it on all sides, and that's what we've been doing up to this point. And then we'll keep taking what comes at us and deal with it in a very similar way.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, obviously, you've been pretty aggressive on the share repurchase side in the first half of this year. You also mentioned that there's a pretty healthy M&A pipeline that you have. How are you thinking about the uses of cash as we think about the back half of this year and then maybe even into early next year?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","I think they both are good uses of cash and capital. I'm happy with our repurchases up to this point this year. I think if we continue to see opportunity, we have capacity for another $500 million there. So that is still a possibility on that side. We're looking at acquisitions and, in the midst of looking at things, want to make sure that its good value. So we're looking at high-quality businesses and making sure that we can buy them at what are reasonable prices and we're looking at a number of different things. So I'm hopeful that that equation works.","And so I'd kind of be looking at both simultaneously and looking for us to continue to use capital in the second half of the year and into 2019. We've got good strong cash coming out of the businesses that we've got. We're moving aggressively in terms of repositioning actions when we've got to take them. And so, we've got a good operating set of folks leading that side of the business. So I'm comfortable with our cash flow and our ability to take on the levers that we need to create incremental value.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. Okay. Thank you.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Klein","Thank you, Brian and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams delivered solid sales growth in the third quarter despite powerful storms that impacted each of our businesses.","Labor constraints continued to be an issue and seem to be exacerbated by the hurricane cleanup effort. Despite these challenges, we were still able to grow EPS against a strong prior year comp and included about $0.10 of one-time benefit. I'm proud of our team's performance on both sales and profit.","Importantly, the home products market continued to grow at a consistent pace with strong new construction demand and continued growth from R&R. Even with the storm disruption, which began late in the third quarter and will likely linger in some areas to the fourth quarter, we remain on track for another year of solid sales and profit growth.","First, let me spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market, then I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the third quarter, last, I will discuss our capital deployment. Pat will then provide more details on our third quarter performance and our 2017 outlook.","Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the third quarter, the market for our home products grew at pace similar to what we've seen earlier in the year. We estimate that new construction grew in the high single-digits, while repair and remodel activity grew at around 5%, both were in line with our expectations.","Demand started strong early in the quarter, but was affected by hurricanes later this quarter and will have an impact on the fourth quarter as well. Notably, fundamental demand trends are solid. The direct impact of the storms on orders and shipments and the related impact on labor availability in Florida and Texas is important to acknowledge.","Florida, in particular, is a big market for us across the company. In large parts of the state, were essentially shut down for three weeks, as fuel and electricity were in limited supply and many people evacuated.","While there was not as much flooding as in Texas, wind and water damage were still widespread and crews will be busy with repair activity from some time before they're able to focus more on kitchen and bath remodel projects.","The normal shop, design, order and install cycle in remodeling was thrown off a bit, and we're only now starting to see orders pick back up. Incremental additional kitchen and bath repair and remodel activity as a result of storm damage will likely come in 2018 and even early 2019, with the lag similar to what we saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.","The Houston market is a little different. Although not as large in terms of sales for some of our categories as Florida, it is still the fifth largest construction market in the country, and the amount of damage is considerable.","Our past experience would suggest that federal and insurance dollars could start flowing in to help fund rebuilding efforts, and it's possible we could see incremental demand across our categories next year as well as into 2019.","So, these two storms are significant and are impacting the last four months of the year. We started to see some signs of orders returning to pre-storm levels, but the pace and timing of recovery in these markets through the quarter remains uncertain.","Despite the disruption, the overall market continued to grow, and demand for home products remained solid. Our market assumption remains unchanged and we estimate that the U.S. home products market, which impacts over 70% of our sales, grows at a 6% to 7% rate for the full year.","Looking forward, our basket of near-term indicators show the home products market remains pointed to strong underlying demand, with continued constraints in skilled labor impacting both new construction and repair and remodel.","Now, let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the third quarter, our teams delivered solid performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 5%, and total company operating margin increased to 14.9%. Our EPS performance was particularly strong, given the challenging comp to last year's results that included one-time benefits worth about $0.10 that did not repeat this year.","Beginning with our Plumbing segment. Plumbing had another quarter of strong growth, and our Global Plumbing Group strategy is working. Sales were up 12% for the quarter with solid mix, and operating margin was strong at over 22%. Organic sales were ahead of market and up high single-digits, with growth in all channels. And our acquisitions from last year are performing as expected, with solid growth year-on-year.","Given another quarter of solid GPG performance, I wanted to reiterate our strategy for the Global Plumbing Group. A little over a year ago, we outlined the strategy, which was to take a business with market growth in the mid-single-digits and accelerate its growth into the low double-digits for the next several years while maintaining roughly 20% to 21% operating margin.","We took steps to upgrade our execution in a number of areas, including strengthening our leadership team, growing sales channels by finding new paths for organic growth, accelerating our product development pipeline, upgrading our digital marketing efforts, leveraging our leading supply chain and distribution capabilities, realizing the potential from well-integrated acquisitions and deepening our pool of talent and focusing them on higher-impact areas.","Looking back, our strategy is working well, with each key element of our plan meeting or exceeding our initial expectations. And this is all reflected in the strong overall GPG performance.","Our acquisitions from last year, Riobel, ROHL and Perrin & Rowe, have performed well inside of GPG. The early success of the platform we have created demonstrates that we can leverage future acquisitions to deliver incremental growth. And we continue to fill up the GPG brand and product portfolio.","Recently, we added Victoria + Albert, a U.K. based premium brand of standalone bathtubs, sinks, tub fillers, faucets, and other accessories. Victoria + Albert provides a complementary brand in the portfolio and is known for its distinct quality, design and proprietary manufacturing techniques. We also acquired Shaws of England, a premium sink manufacturer also known for its quality and design, that will elevate our product, brand and price point offering.","Today, V + A and Shaws are expected to contribute approximately $45 million in combined annual revenue. However, we should be able to accelerate their growth under the GPG platform as we leverage our existing relationships with top builders and in wholesale and hospitality. Our marketing capabilities and investments in these businesses should enable growth above the market at attractive margins.","We continue to deliver organic growth ahead of the market and build on the GPG platform with additional brands and products. We are focused on other potential acquisitions that cover a range of price points, deal sizes and geographies. I'm very pleased with our team's progress thus far, and we remain solidly on track to our goal of $2.5 billion in Plumbing sales by 2020 with strong operating margins.","Now turning to our Cabinets segment. In the third quarter, we're very pleased as we reversed trends in the parts of the market that were lagging for the last four quarters. All channels reflected positive sales, while we continue to follow a strategy that remains focused on disciplined profitable growth in the most attractive segments of the market.","When adjusting for in-stock inventory swings, sales growth was roughly 3% and approaching mid-single-digits after further adjusting for the negative impact of the hurricanes later in the quarter. The hurricane impact was directly felt in suspended orders, sales and shipments and it indirectly magnified already present labor constraints for big R&R projects.","Despite this, I'm pleased we grew sales across channels, including premium, Canada, and home center special order, and we remain on track to grow operating margin to target levels for the year.","In the channels where we are most heavily focused, dealer and in-stock cabinets and vanities, sales increased low single digits. When adjusted for the inventory swings in the third quarter of last year, in-stock cabinets and vanities increased mid-single-digits.","We are planning for the launch of new additional programs in 2018 and are focused on partnering with our core customers to continue to capitalize on product trends and drive profitable growth.","For the remaining 25% to 30% of our Cabinets business, which includes home center special order, builder direct, and targeted markets in Canada, sales grew mid-single-digits. We remain focused on the most attractive regions and partners to drive profitable growth in these segments by being disciplined with pricing and promotional cadence of our market-leading brands, products and service levels.","We were particularly pleased with the initial results from the changes we made to our Canadian business, where our refine approach worked well in driving above-market growth with an improving mix and margin profile.","In summary, I feel good about our industry-leading Cabinet business. We continued to execute well and deliver solid results despite headwinds from storms, ongoing labor constraints, and home center sales promotions.","October sales got off to a slow start due to the storms, but orders have picked up recently. Given our current visibility into orders and the level of quoting activity in showrooms, we currently expect mid-single-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter and continue to expect solid operating margin improvement for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017 in Cabinets.","Doors' reported sales were up 7% for the quarter. Door products again saw sales growth in both wholesale, where sales were ahead of market in the high single-digits; and at retail, where sales increased mid-single-digits. Operating margin growth was strong and ahead of our expectation.","Strong new construction placements in our enhanced distribution in the southern and western U.S. drove the sales growth in wholesale, despite a clear hurricane impact on order patterns in Texas and Florida, which are big markets for us in the overall door market.","Retail sales were also solid even after comping against a large inventory load-in last year. Overall, performance and execution remain solid in the Door business, and we're gaining share while focusing on the most attractive parts of the market.","Therma-Tru continues to benefit from the shift toward fiberglass entry doors and away from steel, a trend which drives an improving product mix within our business. We remain well on track in Doors and continue to operate with increased efficiency in an attractive market that provides our team with lots of opportunity.","In the Security segment, sales increased 1%. As we have seen over the past two quarters, some sales continued their shift into the fourth quarter and we were also winding down a few select commercial product lines.","Growth in our core business was solid and was up mid-single-digits in the third quarter after excluding the product line exits, which were specific to a couple of commercial applications. International and Canadian sales were particularly strong. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect overall sales growth in the mid-single-digits, which will likely land us in the low to mid-single-digit range for the full year.","Operating margin continues to be very strong at 17.8%, driven by last year's integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock. While we will fully anniversary that transition by the end of the year, we continue to expect operating margin to be very strong going forward and should finish the full year with operating margin above 15% in Security.","Before I turn the call over to Pat, I wanted to give some perspective on our capital deployment and our broader plans to create incremental shareholder value going forward. Since we began as a public company six years ago, we remain committed to efficiently deploying capital to maximize shareholder value. Since our October 2011 spin-off, we have deployed more than $3 billion in capital, including $1.5 billion on acquisitions, $1.2 billion on share repurchase, and approximately $400 million on dividends.","Specific to our 2017 capital deployment year-to-date, as of October 20th, we spent approximately $210 million on repurchasing approximately 3.4 million shares. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to share repurchase as the ability to flex capital between buybacks and acquisitions should maximize the creation of incremental value.","Regarding acquisitions. We spent approximately $140 million on the additions to our Plumbing business. We remain active with a variety of potential acquisition opportunities within the GPG as well as for our other business segments.","Our success thus far gives us confidence that we can continue to create significant incremental value going forward through acquisitions and I'm pleased with our pipeline and activity.","Lastly, we'll likely spend approximately $110 million on dividends in 2017. We have raised the dividend each year since it was introduced and it remains an important part of our plan to create incremental shareholder value.","As a reminder, even after including the nearly $415 million deployed so far in 2017, with some additional deployment planed in the fourth quarter, we continue to believe, over the next three years, we still have the potential to deploy roughly $3 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value through the combination of strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends.","So, to recap the quarter, despite some headwinds and a tough comp against the one-time benefits in our EPS last year, our teams delivered solid sales growth and increased profit. We executed well in the U.S. home products market that is continuing to grow at a healthy rate despite continued labor constraints among installers and trades people. And we're gaining momentum in our Global Plumbing Group, with impressive organic and incremental growth. As we refine our plans for 2018, our current momentum and market outlook gives us confidence that we could continue to deliver strong results.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Pat, who will review our third quarter financial performance and provide detail on our outlook for 2017.","Patrick Hallinan","Thanks Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.","Let me start with third quarter results. Sales were $1.35 billion, up 5% from a year ago. We estimate storms cause the sales headwind approaching 100 basis points in the quarter and will impact the fourth quarter as well. Also, labor constraints continue to be a headwind.","Despite the hurricane disruption and labor constraints, sales grew across all of our business segments. Profit growth and margin were solid. We remain on track to deliver our near-term and long-term growth and margin targets.","Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $201 million, up 7% or $12 million compared to the same quarter last year. Excluding a non-repeating benefit from prior year healthcare costs, operating income increased 12%.","EPS were $0.83 for the quarter versus $0.80 for the same quarter last year, increasing $0.03. Earnings were strong and in line with expectations as we overcame $0.10 of one-time prior year favorability from healthcare expense and tax rate.","Now, let me provide more color on segment results, starting with Plumbing. The GPG generated strong sales growth in the third quarter. Sales were $438 million, up $47 million or 12%. Excluding acquisitions, sales grew high single-digits. Sales in Canada and China increased low double-digits. The GPG also delivered strong operating margin in the quarter as our operating margin rose 50 basis points to 22.2%.","Operating income increased $12 million to $97 million, up 15% from the prior year quarter. We increased brand investment in the third quarter. This investment was more than offset by productivity improvements and cost leverage elsewhere in the business.","Turning to Cabinets, our third quarter sales were solid, given some of the inventory movement, labor constraints, and hurricane headwinds described by Chris. Our operating margin was roughly flat, excluding a one-time benefit from healthcare expense in the prior year period.","Margin growth was limited in the quarter as expected commodity inflation was absorbed ahead as we fully instituted price increases. Importantly, we expect fourth quarter margin to be greater than 100 basis points above that of the prior year quarter.","Sales were $614 million, up 2% from the prior year. All channels contributed to growth, including premium in Canada. In-stock inventory comps, labor, and hurricane headwinds muted growth.","Dealer sales were up 1%. Sales of in-stock cabinets and vanities were up 2%; 5%, excluding the impact of hurricanes and inventory movement from last year. Remaining sales for home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 4%, with both home center semi-custom and Canada contributing to growth. We expect Cabinet sales to be mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter.","Operating income for the Cabinet segment declined 7% from the prior year, but was roughly flat after adjusting for the one-time healthcare benefit. The favorable prior year healthcare expense [Indiscernible] all segments, but had the most significant impact on Cabinets, as more Cabinet employees opted for the high deductible plan option and Cabinets account for 60% of our total employee base. As anticipated, operating margin for the quarter declined 110 basis points to 11.3%.","In the fourth quarter, we expect margin improvement of greater than 100 basis points over the prior year quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver operating margin improvement approaching 100 basis points.","Turning to Doors, Door sales were $139 million, up $9 million or 7% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 13%, with an operating margin of 18.2%, which benefited from improved product mix and leverage on higher sales. For the full year, we expect Door sales to grow mid-single-digits and margins to be well above 14%.","For Security, sales were $158 million in the third quarter, up 1% from the prior year. Segment operating income was $28 million and the segment operating margin was 17.8%, 80 basis points higher than last year.","We expect fourth quarter sales to grow mid-single-digits as our core continues to perform well globally and the factors limiting third quarter growth have less of an impact on fourth quarter sales. For the full year, we expect sales growth at or above 3% and operating margin to increase over 100 basis points to above 15%.","To sum up consolidated third quarter performance, sales increased 5% and EPS were solid at $0.83 versus the tough prior year comp. Our total company operating margin was 14.9%, up 10 basis points from the prior year.","Incremental margin, excluding acquisitions of 20%, reflected our investment spending and the non-repeat benefits from the prior year. We are squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state.","Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our September 30th balance sheet remains solid with cash of $277 million, debt of $1.5 billion, and our net debt to EBITDA leverage remains constant of 1.4 times despite strong capital deployment. We have over $300 million of share repurchase authorization remaining as of October 20th.","Turning last to the details of our 2017 outlook. Our market assumption for 2017 remains unchanged with the U.S. home products market expected to grow 6% to 7% versus the prior year. Our total global market assumption of 5% to 6% also remains unchanged, although we could be at the lower end of these ranges due to the hurricanes.","Due to the impact of the hurricanes on our third and fourth quarters, we now expect our full year 2017 sales to increase 6% to 7% compared to 2016, which represents a one percentage point reduction of the top end of our prior guidance.","With one quarter remaining, the range of our 2017 EPS outlook was narrowed to $3.05 to $3.10 from $3.04 to $3.12. The midpoint reflects a 12% increase over prior year EPS of $2.75.","We continue to expect 2017 free cash flow to be around $450 million, with a conversion rate of over 90%. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions; interest expense of around $50 million, a full year tax rate of approximately 30.5%, and the average fully diluted shares of approximately 156 million.","In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date performance and are setting up for a strong 2018. New construction growth continues to be very strong and R&R continues to grow at a healthy pace despite labor constraints.","Recent trends and long-term fundamentals continue to point to solid demand and an elongated housing recovery and our disciplined focus on profitable growth is producing the results we expect.","While hurricanes negatively impacted the third and fourth quarters, we expect the impact to be transitory with 2018 benefiting from the recovery. We are on track to hit our long-term operating margin goal of 15% as the housing market reaches its long-term average. We remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks Pat. That concludes our prepared remarks on the third quarter of 2017. We will now begin taking questions. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Scott Rednor","Hi good afternoon. Chris, there's a lot of mixed data points out there in Cabinets from Wall Street. And I was just curious, through all the puts and takes and the various channels that you guys see it, what do you estimate the markets growing in both units and dollars?","Christopher Klein","Yes, I think in a steady state type environment, take out the hurricane and if you take out some of the noise, you're probably in the kind of 3% to 5% range, a little stronger on new construction, a little weaker on R&R, primarily because of the sequencing of projects. There's a lot of demand out there or there's a lot of quoting activity going on.","After kind of the effect of the hurricane rolling through the markets that it impacted, we're seeing the orders starting to flow back in again. I think as I look out into 2018, I'd say mid-single-digits is reasonable, a little stronger than that on new construction and R&R, maybe in that kind of 4% range. So, that's probably the world we're in right now today. A little bit of variance in terms of parts of the market and the margin profile is a little different, a little stronger on the dealer side right now. But that's kind of how we're looking at it.","Actually, we started the third quarter pretty strong and kind of came through, and it was really too bad September hit and the way the weather impacted in those parts of the market. I think we reflected the strength overall in our Cabinet business as the parts of the market that had been weaker, especially the premium side of the market in Canada, turn positive again. And our strategy is to look across the market and look for those segments of the market that give us strong margin improvement and then target the growth in those parts of the market.","Scott Rednor","And then one on the Plumbing acquisitions. For the three deals that you've done to-date, just curious what you've learned on both kind of the cost and revenue side of the equation that can be used for kind of the new deals and how we should think about that in applying it to the new announcements today?","Christopher Klein","Yes, we've really, over the last 15 months, been able to identify some very attractive Plumbing assets and make some acquisitions that extend out the product line, extend into some price points. And a lot of this is going to be revenue growth because they've already got pretty strong margin profiles.","We'll get some benefit in terms of supply chain over time, but the real benefit here is going to be growth, running it through the GPG platform, which really means expanding distribution, leveraging the strength that we've got today in showrooms and wholesale with builders, hospitality in particular, really attractive market for us.","So, these latest two, we're very excited about. The acquisitions that we've done over the last 15 months preceding them have gone extremely well. And the whole thing is coming together. The strategy we outlined last summer, as you start off on something, we felt very confident about our ability to expand the growth. But as we've made investments, as we brought new people in, as we have expanded our capabilities, it's playing out better than we thought and I think you can see that in the numbers.","Scott Rednor","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good afternoon. I just kind of wanted to expand a little bit on the recent acquisitions that you did. It sounds like these are two businesses that, perhaps, you're going to bring to the U.S.","And I guess, within that, as we sort of look out there and we think about some of the valuations and the way things are playing out, do you see an opportunity to, perhaps, pursue deals in other markets and other geographies and, perhaps, use that as a way of bringing new products or new brands into this market?","Christopher Klein","Yes, we're looking kind of across things that we can bring into the North American market because we're so strong and we have such this terrific distribution leverage and these fit into that category. But also going back the other way, so these offer an opportunity to expand some distribution into Europe. China is certainly an important market for us and we continue to expand our suite in China or, really selling the entire bathroom suite now and expanding the kitchen offering in China and some of that's just bringing product in that we're sourcing or partnering with. So, I see more activity that could be cross-border.","The Plumbing market really is a global market. It's the most global market that we play in. Our real strength historically has been in North America, and we're going to try to leverage that by taking things that we can bring it here and expand the growth. And certainly, the things we've done the last 15 months fall in that category. But I'm open to looking at other markets and there are things that we're working on right now that could expand this more internationally.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you. And then can you talk a little bit about, perhaps, the input costs that you're seeing? Has there been any inflation there? How are you thinking about that trending over the next few quarters?","Patrick Hallinan","Yes, this is Pat. I'd say, for the year, commodity inflation, as it impacts our P&L, has been within the bounds of our expectation. While there's been some acceleration in this latter third of the year, again, that was within the bounds of our expectation. We've had some very robust supply chain initiatives. And as we have done over our history, we keep our brands healthy and are able to price in inflation, have altered the timing of some pricing actions.","So, we think for 2017, despite the acceleration in the latter third of the year, no change. We're on target for fourth quarter, operating margin improvement approaching 100% and full year approaching 100%. Some of the metals inflation will be more of a 2018 impact for us. But again, we expect to cover it with price and keep our Plumbing margins intact.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall","Hey good morning. Good afternoon and congrats on a very strong quarter in a period with hurricane disruptions. I just want to ask Patrick, just for clarification, the step-down in gross margin isn't really an operational issue, but it's rather attributable to the fact that there was a tailwind in the prior year period which led to outsized margin performance. But on an apples-to-apples basis, you basically are flat margin year-over-year not down for the Cabinet segment. Is that the right way to think about it?","Patrick Hallinan","You're talking operating margin. If you take Cabinets and you adjust Cabinets for the one-time healthcare expense true-up, third quarter 2017 is roughly flat to third quarter 2016. And for the year, we're going to expect it to approach 100 basis points of improvement. We'll have over 100 basis points of improvement in the fourth quarter. So, we feel the Cabinets business very much on its margin trajectory and as you referenced, the third quarter dynamic is a year-over-year comp issue.","Robert Wetenhall","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for the clarification. Chris, I wanted to ask you, it's a little uncharacteristic. You talked about capital allocation in your prepared remarks. You've obviously put down two more acquisitions in Global Plumbing, which is great. Congratulations. Where is your head at? What's your outline for, like, 2018, 2019, 2020? Give me like a three-year bridge. You got a super clean balance sheet. You can leverage up. You got a lot of cash flow. What are you going to do? It looks like a lot of public assets now are trading at pretty healthy multiples. How are you going to find the growth and what do you want to do with all the liquidity from a capital allocation standpoint? Thanks and good luck.","Christopher Klein","Thanks. Yes, we're -- it's high-class problem. We've got strong cash flow and a clean balance sheet. So, we look out over the next three years and say, we've got roughly $3 billion to deploy. If you look back over the last six years, we deployed about $3 billion and allocated that a little bit more toward acquisitions, opportunistic share repurchases and continuing to increase the dividend and I'd look to do the same.","To the extent we could find value-creating acquisitions, that'd be a higher priority, but I'm happy to be reinvesting in the business by buying back shares and continuing the dividend.","I think in terms of public market valuations, you're right to highlight that there's a premium on a lot of the public assets. I think a lot of the things that we're looking at might offer better returns that are not currently public. That doesn't mean I wouldn't look at doing one. Obviously, we acquired Norcraft as a public company. So, for the right type of opportunity, I'd look at it and those are on the radar screen. But I'd rather be working in kind of the private market to the extent those are available.","It's a long pipeline. There are a lot of things we look at. The team is busier than they have ever been. We've got a couple of things done. We've got more that we're working on right now. Can't predict if they'll close this year or into next year. But there's just a lot going on right now.","You're right to call out the valuation, which ends up having us walk away from certain situations. But where we can find things where we can really add value, where we can add revenue opportunity as a part of the strategy, we can take up costs as we've done in the Cabinet side with the acquisitions because we have such strong leverage in our supply chains.","In our other parts of our business, we're looking at other things where we can have some combination revenue and cost takeout. Then you pay a fair price for things, knowing going in that I can identify very clearly where I'm going to create some value.","The Plumbing side, as I talked earlier, we're very excited about the revenue opportunities, and we know where they are, and we know where we can take this portfolio even farther, given the success we've had over the last 12, 15 months. So, it gives us confidence to pursue things, knowing exactly where they're going to fit in.","Robert Wetenhall","Could you just maybe give us a little color? When you're talk about the opportunities, are these big dollar spend opportunities or are these smaller tuck-in acquisitions just like the two most recent purchases? Thanks and good luck.","Christopher Klein","I think we've got -- we probably got, by count, more small mid-sized opportunities that you'd tuck into the business. But then there are a few larger things that we're looking at, both in our categories as well as potentially fifth leg. I wouldn't say that, that is where our priority is, but there are those things out there that could be attractive for us.","Again, if I look at where can we add value, I don't want to buy something just to add it to the portfolio to deploy the capital. It really has to be where can we create value because we uniquely own that asset versus anybody else owning it or it being standalone today. And so it's a pretty heavy screen for us in making sure that there's good reason for us to own it.","Robert Wetenhall","Appreciate the discipline. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng","Hey guys. Margin expansion have been really impressive in Security. How should we think about the operating leverage in this business going forward as you kind of lap some of these synergies from SentrySafe?","Patrick Hallinan","Yes, we'll -- Philip, this is Pat. We'll anniversary that by the end of this year. I would tell you that the kind of go-forward operating leverage of that business should span between the 25% to 30% you see in many of our businesses. We would expect that type of leverage to drive the OI margin up. It could be towards 17% over time. And as we start hitting that, we'll start making trade-offs of, do we want to invest different things back in the business to keep the topline going. But we firmly expect the business to deliver over 15% in full year margin this year and we expect it to continue to lever in that 25% to 30% range.","Philip Ng","Got you. That's helpful. And with some of the hurricane impact and labor constraints you called out potentially lingering into the fourth quarter, how confident are you being able to achieve that mid-single-digit growth target for Cabinet? And as we look out to 2018, do you expect some of these bottlenecks to kind of vane off just because demand in Cabinets have generally been pretty choppy the last year or two? Thanks.","Christopher Klein","Yes, I think we're pretty comfortable with the fourth quarter in Cabinets. We're already seeing the pipeline build, the backlog build and we're seeing some of the impacts, especially in Florida, dissipate. So, [Indiscernible] flow.","For perspective, Florida and Texas, combined, are about 12% of our total revenue as a company. So, it wasn't inconsequential further down Florida and to the extent it sucked in labor from the southeast. I was down in Florida two weeks after the storm and the crews running around were coming out of Georgia and Florida and surrounding areas, out of Carolina. So, it sucked in some labor that will then get pushed back out again. So, I'm comfortable. It's flowing well. The recovery is going well. It was just a shock given just the size of the business importance to us overall.","As I go into 2018, I'd say, demand is strong. Demand is strong in Cabinets. It really is about the ability to start the project and move through the design and then the installation. And early in the year, there was a lot better clarity around kind of where the labor is deployed. Things got backed up. New construction is taking a lot of the skilled trades. And so the R&R part of the market, especially for more complex R&R projects, is just stretching out. Projects are stretching out. Where you might have gotten a project done in six months, they can now stretch out nine, 12 months. They can be done in segments. So, you're taking on part of the projects just given more of the availability.","So, if I look out over the next couple of years, I'd say demand is quite strong for kitchen and bath remodeling. The cabinetry is the foundation of those remodel projects. We're a leader in cabinets, and we're going to participate as those rooms get remodeled.","Consumer research, which we're doing on a continuous basis, continues to emphasize the top desire of consumers to remodel is their kitchen, only followed by the bathroom. And so kind of being in these markets with our Cabinets and our Plumbing business really positions us well to participate there.","So, it's hard to -- it does look choppy. It does feel choppy as we talk to our partners out there in the market, both the home centers and the dealers and they reflect frustration that there are a lot of people out shopping, there's a lot of polling going on. But when they try to sequence it up for when the project's going to get taken on, a little bit of frustration out there. So, we'll work through it. And I'd rather be dealing with that kind of problem versus uncertain demand, which is where we were a few years back given economic considerations.","Today, I think, affordability is very strong. Consumers have an interest in doing R&R in their homes. Existing housing stock is turning over at really strong rates, and I expect that to continue. And as people buy an existing home, the kitchen and bathroom are primarily remodel targets for them. So, all that, I think, backs up then the strong demand for the next couple of years.","Philip Ng","Okay. Thanks a lot for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my call as well. Maybe if I could just press a little bit more on that last question from Phil. I think if you take out the calendar shift from the fourth quarter of last year, I think your Cabinet comp is somewhere around 7%, which is pretty healthy. Maybe are there any areas of the Cabinet business that you think are going to drive this fourth quarter kind of mid-single-digits off of that comp?","Christopher Klein","Yes. I mean, I'd look at the home portfolio and say, we're driving toward mid-single-digits for the fourth quarter in Cabinets. The strength of the business where the last four quarters, you saw -- we saw weakness on the premium and some weakness in Canada that has now stabilized and reversed. So, we've got positive momentum moving through each segment of the business.","So if I look at dealers tracking toward mid-single-digits in-stock cabinets and vanities. If you play through the adjustments on inventory was at mid-singles in the third quarter and will remain mid-singles in the fourth quarter. Canada has reversed and is now running mid-single-digit positive with good mix coming through there. Builder direct will move mid-single, could go high single as they can ramp up completion. So, we're in a lot of projects. It's just a question of getting completions done.","And then home center semi-custom, with our core partners, we're doing well. We're holding share there. It's really promotional cadence and where does that go and we've followed others. We've kind of been behind in terms of aggressiveness of some of our competitors, but we're holding our own in terms of share in the home center special order part of the market.","So, I look across and I say, mid-single-digits looks good across the portfolio. Home center special order, probably a little more question mark just given that promotional cadence, but that's only 14% of our total portfolio. So, -- and we've got some really good programs going with our biggest two customers there. So, that's the finish up of 2017. As I look into 2018, again, the demand indicators all point toward some pretty strong growth. So, I'm feeling good about that demand.","John Lovallo","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe on the Plumbing side. The 22.2% margin was certainly higher than we had expected. And I think that you guys had anticipated about $8 million of planned incremental spend in the quarter. Did that get pushed into the fourth quarter by any chance?","Christopher Klein","I'd encourage you to -- and just we said in the first quarter when we came in at 19%, and everybody said, oh, no, your margins are falling apart. We're targeting 21% for the year. And there are spending differences quarter-to-quarter. I'd say 21% is a terrific thing to model our business around in Plumbing.","The spending will ebb and flow a little bit in terms of accelerating in some quarters, depending upon as programs are set up and we're trying to drive through new product launches, we're trying to drive through some marketing spend. So, it'll ebb and flow. I'd just say, 21% is good for the year. I don't know if you can give any more color, Pat.","Patrick Hallinan","John, what I would also say is for the third quarter, no -- there were no delays or holdbacks to the investments in our brand and innovation and digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities. We're continuing to invest heavily in those the back half of this year, against what was pretty heavy investment the back half of last year.","What drove some of the favorability in the third quarter versus the 21% was just the timing and net result of productivity improvement savings in our operations. That team is doing a great job. They had an aggressive plan for the year and they're delivering against it.","But to Chris's starting point, right, we would suggest you model this business around 21%. We're trying to drive it to that level and invest in the business and there will be ups and downs from quarters.","Christopher Klein","To the extent we free-up, commodity starts coming out of the productivity, we're going to drive them into growth, which is our overall objective is let's hold it at 21%. Let's grow in the low teens in that business. And the success we're having so far gives us comfort that we've got a good team in place that will deploy those dollars in a very thoughtful way.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Timothy Wojs","Hey guys good morning or good afternoon. Sorry, it feels like morning. Can -- is there a way to think about what the pricing increase in Cabinets might look like in the fourth quarter, maybe in 2018? I'm just trying to kind of think about what [Indiscernible] might have cost you in Q3 and kind of how that maybe normalizes in the fourth quarter on the EBIT line in Cabinets.","Christopher Klein","A general answer, pricing tends to lag commodity and so we're moving pricing through and recovering any increases. And to the extent, Pat laid out, where we think the margin improvement's going to come in the fourth quarter or 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter and then, for the full year, approaching 100 basis points, that's embedded in there. And then as we move into 2018, we'll give you further guidance, but we're marching toward 14% to 15%.","Typically, across all of our categories, all of our commodities, we've been able to recover commodity increases, but there's a lag. And as we kind of go back out to our customers and work with them to move the pricing through the system, it just takes a little while.","Timothy Wojs","Okay, okay. And then if I -- just kind of maybe shifting gears a little bit to capital allocation and the buybacks. Was -- just given the buybacks in Q3 and maybe October to-date, is that a function of just you guys have more U.S. based cash and you thought the share price was attractive and you had done a couple of deals and you figure, why keep it on the balance sheet? Or is there any sort of change in terms of how you think about share repurchase versus M&A?","Christopher Klein","No, it was the former, not the latter. I think we've kind of -- we're working a lot of acquisition opportunities all the time, but we're not forcing it. And so to the extent that we push some aside or some get extended out, we keep accumulating cash.","The one thing that we promised when we went out six years ago was we're going to be operationally disciplined and we'll react quickly to the extent markets turn down. So, we're not going to stockpile cash for rainy day. We're going to be efficient with our cash and we're going to be efficient with our balance sheet. And so if you looked at kind of where the markets were and where we're trading over the summer, we thought that -- and we've just completed our three-year outlook in terms of our plan and so we benchmark kind of looking at our internal plan based on conservative assumptions, how does that roll through over the next three years. And therefore, what's good value? And so we had a good basis for that value. And so as we've done in the past, to the extent we have cash, we deployed it opportunistically into some buybacks and we're happy we did it.","And I think we're constantly running that evaluation and looking at what's near in terms of deployment of cash into acquisitions. So, no philosophical change. Things will appear a little choppy from time-to-time. But when you step back and you kind of tally it up as we look back on the last six years, it kind of falls into place, slightly more in acquisitions, aggressive opportunistic share repurchase and then a consistent dividend. And that's -- that has been what we're doing -- what we've done and that is what we'll do.","Timothy Wojs","Great. Good luck on the rest of the year.","Christopher Klein","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Mike Wood","Hi good evening. Just wanted to circle back on the dealer growth in Cabinets. I don't think you mentioned the hurricane impact there. But you're flat last quarter and dealer on a very tough comp and only 1% growth this quarter. Just wanted some more color if you have that there, including traffic growth.","Christopher Klein","Yes. So, dealer was up 1%. Would have been up a little bit more like 2%, given the concentration we've got, especially in Florida. And so that's tracking toward single -- mid-single-digits for the fourth quarter. Given the backlog that we've got right now, we're confident that, that's quite achievable in the dealer market.","The thing that turned positive and as the quarter was unfolding kind of before the storms hit in Florida was that we were seeing really good progress on the premium end of the market and the core semi-custom. And those are the parts of the market that as I look back over the four quarters had been weaker and so them turning positive and seeing some good traffic and backlog building in those product lines was really encouraging.","So, it was kind of as if kind of middle of September, I was ready to start doing high-fives and then we had the storm and then there was a pullback and kind of finished up a little bit weaker. But I'm comfortable that with the cadence that's emerged in the dealer channel right now that we're going to have a good fourth quarter and is setting up for a good 2018 as well.","Mike Wood","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just also how -- you don't talk about -- or at least, I don't recall you quantifying productivity much. But you mentioned it recently here in the call. I'm just curious how we should think about that. Is that use to go towards reinvestment? Is it offsetting labor, inflation and other things? And what sort of are the trends in the productivity that you're able to generate?","Patrick Hallinan","Our initial target is we must set off the internal inflation factors that are not commodity driven. But we often, where we want the opportunity, do want to push ourselves to drive investments and innovation in brands. We can often push beyond that. And in a few of our divisions, we've been doing that. Plumbing has been one of those areas where we've been driving productivity improvements beyond the typical labor and, like, internal inflation and then turning around and investing that money in new product development and in new capabilities and additional brand spend just to drive the growth, both organically and inorganically.","But you can -- from a modeling perspective, we use internal productivity improvement to offset non-commodity inflation. We work to cover commodity inflation via mix of price and productivity improvements and hold our margins constant to leverage at about 25% to 30% as we grow our business.","Mike Wood","Great. Thank you.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to the presenters.","Brian Lantz","Thank you. This is Brian. We'll turn -- we look forward to seeing most of you very soon, and talking to a lot of you even this evening and tomorrow. So, thank you everybody for attending the call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fortune Brands Home & Security Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Brian Lantz, you may begin your conference call.","Brian Lantz","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Fortune Brands Home & Security quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress during the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2013 guidance. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier.

Following our prepared remarks, we have allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have. I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We had an excellent fourth quarter and a terrific first full year as an independent public company. Our quarter performance was driven by strong sales and profit growth, which came in slightly ahead of our expectations. We again outperformed the market for our products and continued to drive profitable growth as the market recovers.","Let me first spend some time on the fourth quarter highlights and then I'll discuss our 2013 guidance. First, with regard to the market, new construction was again strong in both single-family and multifamily starts, and the pace of Repair & Remodel continued in the same 3% to 4% range despite consumer caution for big-ticket purchases like cabinets and windows. Importantly, we feel confident about our performance in this market and the execution of our strategies as we enter 2013.","Turning to our performance in the quarter. Sales were up 8% and EPS was up 35% from a year ago with all segments performing well. Cabinet sales grew 12% ahead of our estimates for cabinet market growth in the fourth quarter driven by new construction. Importantly, our profits in cabinets were up $15 million in the quarter and more than doubled for the full year. Moen continued its strong performance with sales growth of 15%, slightly stronger than the prior 2 quarters, and profit was up 7%. Windows & Door sales were up 1% and as expected, the segment generated strong profit gains.","Security & Storage sales were down 4% while profit was up 22%. Taking out the benefit of 53rd week in 2011, segment sales were flat to prior year, and security sales were up mid-single digits.","Now let me give you some top line highlights by segment. Sales for our Cabinet business were up 12% for the quarter and exceeded our expectations. We continued to perform well as a market leader in cabinets with strong results across the business. The pace of new construction was a key driver as we saw, again, strength with dealers and builders in our new construction mines, while big-ticket Repair & Remodel continued to lag. In the dealer channel, where we're the clear market leader, we grow by leveraging our portfolio of brands and our strong product and service reputation. We also achieved solid growth in home centers, where we focused on sustainable long-term growth opportunities. We believe innovation and our designer services continued to be competitive advantages in this channel, especially as we remain restrained in our promotional activity.","Relatively, we grew our Cabinet profits by $15 million in the quarter. This performance again reflects our ability to successfully target growth in channels, markets and product segments that are not as promotionally driven, while enhancing our supply chain efficiency to improve profitability. We believe that our market leadership combined with a world-class operating platform and service levels provides us the strategic flexibility to drive profitable growth today and into the future as the cabinet market recovers.","Plumbing sales were up 15% in the fourth quarter. Moen again saw sales gains in both U.S. retail and wholesale and in our international businesses, particularly China. Gains were strongest in our U.S. wholesale business where we saw volume increases driven largely by the pace of new construction. Our leading market share with the top builders and wholesalers, expansion in the multifamily segment and upgraded showroom displays continued to yield strong results, driving sales and profits again in the fourth quarter.","Moen is also seeing strength from our steady pace of consumer-driven innovations like MotionSense, a unique hands-free electronic kitchen faucet. The rollouts of retail and wholesale was significant with investments in displays and an increase in overall brand spending.","Internationally, sales in China, where there are now nearly 750 Moen branded stores were, again, up strong double digits over the prior year, driven by new construction growth and our continued expansion. The team in China continues to build our business with a wider range of price points and with [audio gap] for the Chinese market.","Windows & Door sales were up 1% for the quarter. Door products saw mid-single digit sales gains driven heavily by new construction, partially offset by exiting some less profitable programs. We also benefited from our private-label relationship with a major Windows & Door company and growth with our wholesale distributors. Windows sales were down 2%, driven by continued softness in the Repair & Remodel side of the window market. Importantly, of our 3 housing-related segments, we saw our total sales increased 11% for the fourth quarter, ahead of the overall market for our products.","In Security & Storage, our sales were down 4% for the quarter. Security sales were relatively even with the prior year, again taking out the 53rd week in 2011, segment sales were flat to prior year and security sales were up mid-single digits. Security gains were driven by solid growth in global safety solutions and innovative new products. The Master Lock brand is strong and our innovation continues to hit the mark with our new electronic combination lock dial speed and our new line of commercial electronic access control solutions, which are having success at securing cellular telephone towers and other storage facilities.","So to sum up the fourth quarter, the market continues to be led by significantly stronger new construction and Repair & Remodel market that while growing is not yet as strong as the new construction market. I remain very pleased with our performance across the portfolio.","Now let me turn to our top line outlook for 2013, starting with our assumptions for our market. Lee will then take you through the specific full year guidance for 2013 in a few moments. From a market perspective, we see ongoing signs of improvement in the overall market as we enter 2013. While consumer-related challenges in the housing market remain, new construction was again strong in the fourth quarter as demand for new homes continued to outstrip supply in many markets. However, concerns about the general health of the economy are still weighing on consumers' confidence and their willingness to embrace larger-ticket Repair & Remodel projects. So while Repair & Remodel has sustained moderate growth, large-ticket items like cabinets, windows have yet to fully benefit from this growth.","Our 2013 plans are built on our assumptions that the U.S. home market, including with Repair & Remodel and new construction grows at a combined 6% to 8% range. Based on that market assumption, we expect our 2013 full year sales to increase at a high single-digit rate over 2012, again outperforming the market for our products as we continue our disciplined approach to profitable growth throughout the businesses. Within the businesses, we believe cabinets will see an increase, driven by new construction momentum, innovation and investments in new programs.","For faucets, we'll continue to invest in the Moen brand and launch innovative new products that consumers want. We expect to leverage our market share gains with builders, which should position us well for new construction. And we plan to further invest to expand our innovation, distribution and footprint in China where we have nearly 750 storefronts throughout the country.","In the Windows & Door segment, we believe both the windows and doors businesses are now better positioned to lever common growth opportunities managed together and doors should see ongoing growth for new construction. Security & Storage should benefit from investment in new product innovations, including digital electronic padlocks, other electronic products and services and further expansion into commercial safety.","So to sum up, driven mostly by new construction, the overall market remains firm. We again had strong results, and we're confident in our ability to outperform our market in 2013. We believe that our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provides flexibility to focus on profitable growth and there -- should, therefore, position us to create value at any pace of recovery as we prepare to enter 2013.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our 2013 guidance.","E. Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains, which best reflects ongoing business performance. Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $948 million, up 8% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $61 million, up $17 million or 39% compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.23 for the fourth quarter, up $0.06 or 35% versus the same quarter last year.","Now let me provide a little color on segment results. Our Cabinet sales were $340 million, up $38 million or 12% over the prior year quarter. Operating income for the segment was $12 million versus a $3 million loss in the prior year, up $15 million as we benefited from higher sales volume running through our continually improving supply chain. Full year operating income for the segment was $40 million, more than double the prior year. Our strategy of disciplined sales growth is working as planned as we continue to exceed the overall cabinet market growth while improving profitability.","Plumbing sales for the fourth quarter were $296 million, up $38 million or 15% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income, which was negatively impacted by approximately $6 million of increased spending related to the MotionSense launch and timing of overall brand spend, was $42 million, up 7%. Operating margin was 14%. All channels performed well with both the U.S. wholesale and China businesses experiencing double-digit sales growth.","Windows & Doors sales were $156 million, up $2 million or 1% from the prior year quarter. Within the segment, the Door business experienced mid-single digit growth, while Windows business declined 2%. Operating income for this segment was $4 million, $2 million more than last year as we achieved strong operating leverage on incremental volume and realized supply chain efficiency savings, particularly in windows. For the full year our Windows & Door business profit was $4 million, increasing $8 million from a $4 million loss from the prior year.","Fourth quarter Security & Storage sales were $156 million, down $6 million or 4% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2011, the segment would have been flat and security sales would've increased 4%. Strength in security was driven by U.S. retail and global safety. Operating income was $21 million, up $4 million or 22%, driven by productivity enhancements and cost reduction programs. We incurred certain charges and gains in the quarter that did not impact our EPS before charges and gains of $0.23. These charges and gains totaled $0.12 and are reflected in our GAAP EPS of $0.11. Specifically, we recorded a loss of $0.14 for actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension plans due to a lower required discount rate that more than offset pension asset returns. We also recorded a $0.06 loss related to the results of our impairment testing, which were also discount rate driven. And finally, we recorded an $0.08 gain related to the completion of federal income tax audits for tax periods 2008 and 2009 prior to the spin.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our December 31 balance sheet ended with cash of $336 million. Debt was reduced to $326 million. Our net debt to EBITDA leverage is now 0. We have nothing drawn on our $650 million revolving credit facility. Free cash flow was $326 million for 2012, which included $104 million of option proceeds and gross capital expenditures of $75 million.","So we are pleased with our first full year performance. For 2012, sales grew 8%. Operating profit grew 40%, and EPS increased 48% to $0.89.","Let me now provide our thoughts and further detail on guidance for 2013. Just like in 2012, our approach to the 2013 planning and annual outlook begins with a market assumption. Our approach also includes continued share gains in addition to overall market growth.","So turning to our outlook details, as Chris mentioned, for the full year of 2013, our planning assumption calls for the market, for our U.S. home products, to be up 6% to 8% with new construction growing over 20% and Repair & Remodel growing at 3% to 4%, with purchases of big-ticket items continuing to lag. Based on this market assumption and continued share gains, we expect our full year 2013 sales to increase high single digits compared to 2012, again, outperforming our market and with all segments increasing.","Based on our market and sales growth assumptions, our expectations for EPS are in the range of $1.13 to $1.23. The midpoint of our guidance represents an increase of 33% over 2012 EPS of $0.89. 2013 free cash flow should be at least $200 million after CapEx of approximately $100 million, pension contributions of $35 million and proceeds from option exercises around $35 million.","Longer term, we believe this puts us on track to generate $1.4 billion in cumulative free cash flow over an assumed 5-year period during which the housing market would recover by 2016. Over this period, we assume total housing starts reach 1.5 million per year and Repair & Remodel growth reaches 5% to 6% annually with no lag in purchases of large-ticket items. And as we previously stated, over that assumed 5-year time horizon, this strong free cash flow, combined with our flexible balance sheet, could provide at least $2 billion of cash to drive incremental shareholder value.","In summary, our business model is performing well and we're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. We should be positioned to again perform well in 2013 at any pace of recovery by leveraging our foundation of leading brands, efficient supply chain, proven management team and strong capital structure.","I'll pass the call back to Chris for a few final remarks.","Christopher J. Klein","Thanks, Lee. With the successful close of the fourth quarter, we mark the end of our first fiscal year as an independent company. I'm excited about how well our business teams are performing, how well we are positioned in our markets and the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. All these elements should enable us to continue to drive profitable growth. As we turn to 2013, we are appear to be facing market conditions much like 2012 and I'm confident that we will again outperform our market delivering solid sales and profit growth. And longer term, we believe consumer caution for large-ticket purchases should eventually subside and consumers will act on pent-up demand to provide even more growth opportunities in years to come.","I'll now turn the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks for the fourth quarter and 2013 full year guidance. So we will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","The first question just on the cabinet side, you ran through some of these numbers quickly, but if you were to split out just the dealer business, what was that growth on a year-over-year basis in the quarter?","Christopher J. Klein","We don't disclose that, but it was pretty strong.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So it's above the segment average?","Christopher J. Klein","It was pretty strong.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Well, I guess if you think about the dealer business, you kind of alluded to it almost in the discussion of new construction, but is it wrong to assume that, that is a combination of remodel and new construction?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, it is. It's -- yes, you look at the dealer market -- or you look at the new construction market, part of that market is served direct to builders, especially to larger builders. The rest of market actually goes through the dealer channel. And so I guess a reasonable approximation, because this guy's, I think, aristocrat dealer,  builder branded cabinets going into new construction, but some of the builders, especially on the higher end, will also take some of the semi-custom line. So the dealer is being influenced by new construction. We're just so strong there that we're getting kind of a lot of pickup in a lot of different places.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","But your comments on the remodeling customer for cabinets not yet coming back, is that driven by what you see directly at retail or even beyond the home centers?","Christopher J. Klein","It's the home center and some of that kind of R&R business we track through a dealer. It's up, we know it's positive for the year, it was positive for the quarter. It's just lagging where we think the overall R&R market is at maybe 3% to 4%. We think that it's positive but it's still lower single digits and eventually, it will catch up but it's just taking its time.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then similarly, along the lines for the window segment, so you gave the numbers for the quarter. For the year, the Windows & Doors was up 6%, how would that split between the 2?","Christopher J. Klein","Doors are a bit stronger than windows. So the door business, again, heavily influenced by new construction and our distribution there goes into new construction quite strongly. Our window business is much more of an R&R window business. We do have some new construction exposure. But we're at a higher price point than most kind of builder, especially entry grade, vinyl windows are going in that. And so we only appeal to that kind of higher segment of the new construction site.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","What is that mix roughly? And do you have any ambitions to get into a price point that would benefit from the new construction market?","Christopher J. Klein","No, we're not going to -- it's hard for us to kind of take quality out of our product. The way we are producing that product in terms of just the quality of linear, the quality of assembly, the quality of service, the whole propositional line is up to a higher price point. We're okay there. We think eventually the R&R market comes back and there's a stronger construction market on that side of the market. So we'll pick up some construction side in windows, we're just not going to track on the window side to where the whole new construction market is. And surprisingly, the quality of some of the windows that goes -- that go into new construction across the country isn't as high as what you might think.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then last question, which I have to ask I feel like every quarter, but from a cash flow standpoint, at what point do you sort of get frustrated by holding too much, just from a capital allocation standpoint and I guess kind of wrapped into that, it looks like there was an acquisition in the quarter. If you could maybe just talk about that, too.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I think we've been consistent in saying we're going to invest in our business. We're going to look to return cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and eventually put a dividend in place and then we'll look at acquisitions. And so we're still pursuing kind of all fronts. I think we're early in terms of where we see acquisitions coming back. We think that market will come back more in the next 12, 18, 24 months. But we're looking at all other options on the cash front as well. We did a small acquisition on the safety side of the market within the Master Lock business and that really is to support that business we've been growing pretty rapidly. It's actually a service platform around the safety business that we think will complement the products that we sell in there. So we'll talk more about that as it becomes more meaningful, but it's relatively small. But we're committed as we've talked about, being efficient with cash and our objective is not to stockpile. It's just that we've had strong performance in the second half of the year, and so we find ourselves in a pretty good spot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A lot of the same questions that I had were already answered here, but if you can talk a little bit more, Chris, on the M&A environment and how long would you feel comfortable riding your balance sheet and letting the cash grow and net debt turn negative, et cetera, before you really felt that it's time to put something in place?","Christopher J. Klein","I don't have much more to say in the M&A market. I think things are starting to get a little more active and we'll be disciplined, but as we see attractive opportunities, we'll take advantage of them. In terms of other uses of cash, it's safe to say the board is actively looking at it, and we'll take action as we kind of look at where the market firms up across-the-board. I think new construction is in very good shape coming into the year and all trends look positive. As we said R&R still kind of moving through 3% to 4% and the big-ticket lagging that. And yes, I think as we think about our dividend, we want to make sure the consistency of earnings flowing through and signs look good, but we'll be deliberate in taking any actions that we take. But we're not going to -- our strategy is not just to accumulate stockpile cash, we'll be efficient with that and you'll see us do things throughout the year.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just looking at your guidance, your revenue assumptions underlying, it seemed to be fairly conservative given that the housing construction, least a lot all of the builders are reporting, seem to be accelerating fairly aggressively. I guess, one, could you just sort of talk about how you came back -- I understand where you -- ultimately, you said $1.5 million, $1.6 million in 2016, but just how you came to your underlying assumptions today and then on the cost side, what you're seeing in raw materials, et cetera, that impact your guidance for 2012 -- for 2013.","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. I mean, we start with the outlook on the market itself. So if we look at the market, the home product market, we call it 6% to 8% That's a combination of new construction kind of in the low-20s, which I think is relatively consistent where you see the  -- I mean some estimates will take you up into the mid-20s or higher than that, but we're currently calling it low 20s. And then R&R market at 3% to 4%, pretty consistent, I think. The big issue for us would be growth in the bigger ticket items. So if it's going a little bit slower than 3% to 4% there, that will impact us. So today, we're running about 70% R&R, 30% new construction. Obviously the busier we are in new construction, the more that mix will shift over time, but that's kind of where it's at today. So you just got to net that all that out and that's how you get to 6% to 8%. We'll grow in our home business a couple percent better than that. And then we've got our Security & Storage business, which will kind of grow at roughly GDP. So you kind of roll all that together. I think it's reasonable for what we see. Obviously if the market performs a little bit better or folks have a different outlook on the market that is more aggressive, then we should perform better than that, but what I'm trying to do is just kind of give you the transparency around here is the market that we see, here is how we're planning and therefore, here's how we should perform. On commodity -- on the commodity side, a little bit of plus, a little bit of minus kind of nets it out to 0. I don't know if you want to add anything else, Lee, but there's not much going on. It's a fairly stable market right now. You want to anything, Lee?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, I would just close out '12 by saying we came on right on top of where we had to do you that we had may be a $15 million to $20 min -- $20 million tailwind in '12 and that's about where we came on. And as Chris said, as we think about guidance, we're thinking about pretty modest inflation in '13, and any of that will be covered by a very modest price increase. So fairly flat impact in '13 at the net.","Christopher J. Klein","No, no, wait. The only real impact we see is China wage inflation continues to be an issue out there that kind of 10% to 15% a year. So we continue to kind of work that side of it.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. On wood side, you're not seeing a big pickup then?","E. Lee Wyatt","No, we saw -- for example, in the fourth quarter, you saw wood and parcel board up a point -- a couple of points actually. But we had other commodities that were down so they kind of offset.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to share your thoughts on incremental margins in the various business units. What do you think the greatest upside is as we move into '13?","E. Lee Wyatt","We finished '12 at right around 25% incremental operating margins on the sales growth, which is right in that 25% to 30% where we told you. And as we think about guidance, if you go through the math on it, it's the same kind of place 25% to 30% incremental growth there on margins. So kind of right in the spots where we've told you and within that range. I think you kind of see the upside in several of the segments that you see -- the cabinets, I think you see Moen and you see doors having some margin improvement, but you net all that together and it's in that 25% to 30% incremental range.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And I think you had said, it's $1.5 billion of cumulative free cash flow with the housing recovery, but you said in conjunction with the balance sheet, it could be much as $2 billion.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, we took a little bit debt on so we didn't -- obviously, we don't have much debt right now. So if you ran it at the modest leverage. Incrementally, you could have $2 billion, yes.","E. Lee Wyatt","Bob, that assumes that the housing market recovers 5-year recovery by '16 and we get back to kind of that 50-year averages for the metrics by '16, that's $1.4 billion roughly in free cash flow.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And just one final, if I could sneak it in, any thoughts to selling the Windows & Doors business as being non-core given your leadership position in Cabinets and Plumbing.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, well, what I've talked about before is we've got a very strong Doors business. It leverages incredibly well in new construction. So we're at the front end of a pretty significant recovery in new construction. So I expect terrific things there. On the window side of the market, it's really downstream assembly capacity and there's still a bit of an overhang coming off of the volume we had a couple of years ago. So we're watching that market carefully, and our guys have done an exceptional job taking cost out of the business, creating a much more efficient platform, to making good money now. So I think we'll see improving situation there over the next couple of years. Obviously, we look at everything but I expect that, that's good to generate some pretty good earnings for us. So we're kind of evaluating the markets as they evolve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I guess on the incremental margins. Lee, you kind of mentioned that you expect a little modest inflation offset by modest price improvement to I guess to net out, but what would be the biggest drivers of perhaps getting to the higher end of that range versus maybe getting to the lower end of the range which we saw in 2012?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, I think the market drives much of that. I think, for example, in Repair & Remodel, if big-ticket items start moving back and that lag starts going away, I think that would have a significant impact, and we continue to invest in productivity improvement so those should flow through the year. So it's our productivity improvements, it's -- some volume obviously helps when you're -- if you're going to grow high single digits on the sales line. So it's the leverage, it's the market, specifically, R&R and it's our productivity enhancements that we do.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And also just going back to the balance sheet for a moment, Chris, you mentioned that this is something that is more, particularly when you think about dividend and share repurchase, something that would be reviewed with the board, can you give us some timing in terms of how that might play out this year? Obviously, things like the dividend, the dividend has been discussed and for quite some time now and it seems like every quarter I think we get closer to something on that front and also share repurchase.","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. Yes, I guess putting in a little bit of context, we began life as an independent company 15, 16 months ago. And so I think you kind of start there and say we started the housing recovery about the same time. And we really wanted to show some pretty good trajectory in the market overall as we thought about kind of how we are going to return cash to shareholders. So I think that's kind of the first piece is a kind of how we are in the midst of a robust recovery and therefore, is there a good trajectory established, dividend and establish a cadence for increase in that over a period of time, looking at share repurchases as well and kind of the returns on those. So I think that it's very much part of the discussion. We don't have a set time line, but we continue to talk about that and we'll be efficient as we kind of move through it. And then we'll continue to evaluate any acquisition opportunities as well. So rest assured, we're focused on it, and I think it's a high-class problem. I mean, I think it's a result of the performance that we've had in the business and the way we've managed the balance sheet and frankly, the efficiency of the business platforms that we've got that we're not -- we're seeing this kind of growth but we're not having to plow a lot back in the infrastructure. Where we are investing is in new products and in brands and in other things that we're getting pretty good returns of and we look at where we can get incremental some growth off of those things as well.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But I guess nothing that you'd like to venture, Chris, in terms of giving a sense of timing first half of '13 versus second half of '13?","Christopher J. Klein","No, thank you.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. One last one, if I could, Lee, just a couple of bookkeeping, thoughts around the tax rate for 2013 and also corporate expense, should that drift a little higher similar to the $8 million increase in 2012?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I think with the tax rate, I plan on 33% to 34%, somewhere in that range so pick a midpoint for '13. And I think you'll see, we showed as we continue to grow, we're growing at high single digits, I think in sales. I think you'll see a little more leverage on SG&A. We've been around 25.5%, 26% here this year. I think you'll see a little bit of leverage on that.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But in terms of the corporate expense, it was $60 million in 2012. Any thoughts around 2013? I would assume again it should drift a little higher.","E. Lee Wyatt","No, I would say it's -- when you -- I mean, onetime items that's in there in our first year spinoff, so it'll be at that range or lower probably but...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just I guess going back to the whole issue sort of big-ticket items you talked about in terms of your R&R market up 3% to 4% but big-ticket lagging, what is it that you're looking for in terms of what's driving the conservatism with that? What is it that you're looking for in terms of just getting a bit more optimistic there.","Christopher J. Klein","When you look at the -- it's really the semi-custom marketplace across both the dealer channel and the home center channel and where are we seeing the activity and at what price points and kind of what kind of cadence are we seeing. The good thing is that promotional environment we talked a lot about at the home centers, it seems to be abating a bit. So it's getting a little bit better. I wouldn't declare a victory yet, but it is improving there. So it's a good sign that consumers are active but not needing a huge level of promotion to get them active. I think they're still dealing with the overall economy, which is improving at a fairly modest pace. And so they'll think about having to deploy cash, there's not a lot of credit out there for them to borrow against to invest in their homes yet, so a lot of what we see the investments coming into the home, in the bigger-ticket remodeling projects is coming out of savings. And frankly, it's kind of the older cohort that has got savings that moving money into the home. So eventually, you'll see a broader base of people doing remodeling. The encouraging thing is we do consumer research which suggests that there is pent-up demand. People are still aspiring to remodel their kitchens, their bathrooms. They still want to make that the showcase of the home. That's all positive. I think it's just the broader economic indicators that will drive that piece back up to really 3%, 4% and eventually 5%, 6%, 7% as the market moves into a full recovery. The other thing that will eventually help is there has historically been a correlation between new construction and the R&R market. and I think because we're coming off such a low base in new construction, the number of new houses out there, meaning people moving from either apartments or an existing house into a new house, the overall numbers are still pretty small. And so you've got to get back up to a number of single-family houses that people are relocating into and then leaving another single-family house that's getting sold to create that linkage where then they go and remodel that new existing house that was bought. So that's just going to take a little while to get rolling, but I think it's improving. It's just not there where it should be yet. So I'm not discouraged by it. but we're just being pretty realistic and how do you plan for a year and based on the activity we see, that's where we come out.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then in terms of the plumbing, where do you see margins as within the costs in terms of price introductions roll-off? What do you see in terms of potential for margins in that business?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, you look at the full year, we were about 15.5% operating margins. We would assume even with new product introductions, which we do on a regular basis historically, we see nice improvement in that -- in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Well, I think your comments say your model is performing well. It might be modest here as we look back to 2012, with strong leverage that we saw in cabinets in the fourth quarter above that kind of 25%, 30% range. Could you give us a sense of what might cause you to get better operating leverage, might it be your exposure to the wholesale? Were you able to extract a little more price or I mean conversely, what would be some of the factors -- wood volume moving perhaps a little more volatile than people expect that might cause you to have less operating leverage, just so we can get a sense obviously if things pick up quicker than people think.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I'll make some broad comments and then maybe Lee can follow up as well. But I think you'll see some reasonably good leverage in our business as we start to run more volume through the businesses. So in the case of cabinets, you're really just kind of coming off of a breakeven position 2 years ago and into a profitable position and now we're starting to get reasonably leverage off of, really, the fixed cost and infrastructure of the business. And we're maybe moving away from dependency on a promotional environment to more of the fundamental pricing in that marketplace, which will improve overall. And I think the market will improve as capacity utilization across the whole market improves. So that's definitely a positive and you're kind of get a more sustainable outlook on that marketplace. In case of faucets, we've got a terrific position on the builder, wholesaler side of that market. And as that volume picks up, you see good margins there. We're also seeing consumers starting to trade up a little bit. So we're -- 2009, 2010 houses that were being built consumers and builders are being pretty conservative in terms of the price point. And so they were taking the base-grade product and faucets and showers and now they're starting to actually go to a maybe a first upgrade and second upgrade in that market and that's a better mix for us. Same would be true for entry doors, where you see kind of base-level products and eventually as they get building a little bit nicer houses, they're going to get an upgrade on entry doors. So what -- that mix piece factors in with better utilization to really drive that incremental margin, specifically on a...","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But wouldn't it -- seemed to me like since you're coming off the bottom and you're already performing so well that given the over under you might actually be doing better than your normalized fixed cost absorption?","E. Lee Wyatt","Well, we talked about 25% to 30% incremental margin. We feel pretty good about that over a recovery period as a company. The other thing I think you have to understand, we talked a lot about the big-ticket items in R&R. That helps drive margins obviously because you leverage that fixed cost base in cabinets when that happen. I think the other thing you see is our investments whether they're CapEx or P&L-related, the investments we're making are productivity improvement. That's a lot of our investment. It's -- we invest more in productivity in our plants than we do in just capacity. So we're always investing, we're always getting more efficient, I think that helps drive some of that as well on a macro level.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","All right. Maybe thinking about it a little differently, the M&A angle. But one of your peers in the broad building products space has been quite active over the last 3 or 4 months finding deals that are based out of Europe predominantly, I would say, with some U.S. exposure. How do you think -- I know you really want to say U.S.-centric. You've talked about working in a 2-step channel that kind of mirrors the success you had in your current businesses. Can you talk about perhaps the pluses and minuses to that U.S.-centric. It sounds like a little later cycle-focus in your M&A appetite.","Christopher J. Klein","I'm not sure. I'm not I agree with you...","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Would you go into Europe, for example? I mean there's obviously been some attractive deals for a variety of reasons over there for -- one of your competitors matches their portfolio as one reason.","Christopher J. Klein","I think, yes, as we look at M&A, I think we start by saying there are opportunities around our core businesses and so where that make sense, obviously, that's -- we can leverage more of what we have into an acquisition. We aren't adverse to international. I'd still say Europe is uncertain and so it's not a place that we're actively looking. It think there's more international opportunities, again, that may be leverage market positions that we already got established that we can expand and grow. So that's where I started is, let's look at where we are. We are already U.S.-centric today. That doesn't mean we're not looking internationally. It's just that we're looking internationally in places that we already are to expand that footprint. So we're active in Asian markets. We're active in South America. Could we expand that? Yes, we could. So that's how we start answering that question. And the other pieces just adjacent to the businesses that we're in gives us more leverage, more synergy, more growth opportunities. So those would be ideal. So we're pretty patient. I wouldn't say that means we're not active. I just think we're looking very carefully on the acquisition side and we're fortunate to have very strong businesses today. So maybe that makes the comparisons difficult.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess first question talk about plumbing and the $6 million of spend in the fourth quarter that hit that margin a little bit in the quarter. Can you give us a feel for 2013 in terms of spending both in that segment and across the business, what the incremental spend might look like and then maybe talk about what some of the key growth initiatives might be just outside of the cyclical opportunity that's emerging?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, when you think about promotional spending, and we won't give you specific dollars, but I would tell you, we're just now in 2012 for say Moen and back to where we would historically have spent before we took that down because of the recession, so we feel good about that. In terms of '12 and the year, we spend over 1\/3 of our total year spending in '12 in the third quarter. Did 2 things. It helped us with the MotionSense launch, it drove -- and it drives some momentum into '13. So we feel very good about that timing and that was planned and it was expected. And if you kind of balance out the timing of all that, operating margins for Moen, 15.5%, so very good and we feel good about that. You'll -- probably given now that we have a second year look at the market and in our guidance when we think the market is up 6% to 8% for our products, that equal to or greater than what we think it grew in '12, so you'll see us spend a little bit more and invest a little bit more to drive that brand. It's a very powerful brand and it's gaining a lot of momentum so we feel very good. So those are good investments. We'll get very high returns off of them. And yet, at the same time, we'll still have operating leverage of 25% to 30% in our '13 plan.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful on that. And then curious back to the cabinet business, strong year-over-year incremental margin, if I cut the numbers a little bit differently though, if I look at it sequentially revenue up and the out margin, down a little bit. Is there something in the mix there, you talked about some of the strong growth in a couple of channels there. Is there something in the mix there that maybe tempered the leverage as you look at it at least on a sequential basis?","E. Lee Wyatt","No, we had nice leverage. Each of the last 2 quarters and there's a couple of things going on there and even for the year. One, we're being very disciplined, as Chris has talked about a lot, in terms of not chasing unprofitable or low-margin business. So we're not doing that. I think we're continuing to improve our productivity in our plants. We've closed a couple of plants in the last 12 months. We're continuing to invest in productivity gains and that's driving some of this. And we've also had some line expansions that were as opposed to chasing low-margin business with high-promotion dollars, we're basically broadening lines with better profit margin items. So those 3 things are actually what we're doing to drive margin and we feel pretty good about the margin improvement in the last 2 or 3 quarters.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And how should we think about mix in terms of profitability in that business. I mean if new construction continues to grow, should we think about that business or grow at a pace above and in excess of R&R, should we think about that business as maybe tempering the incremental leverage that we could see out of cabinets?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, the R&R for us and especially the big-ticket items, the organic remodeling as we've said is good business for us. The new construction business for the cabinet segment is a little bit lower price point item. So the good news is we're doing very well. We're leveraging very well for cabinets in terms of margins even with it being driven by new construction. As R&R comes back even stronger and gets back to that 5% to 6% annual growth and big-ticket comes back that you'll get really nice leverage because again that's 70% of our business is R&R. So we're looking forward to the future as this R&R comes back, which it typically does over a recession. Big-ticket items tend to come back a little bit later.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Questions around plumbing, very good numbers in the quarter. You had mentioned some products, share gains and strength of wholesale market. So I'm now going to ask my question, can you give me more detail on the product introductions, and how that wholesale compared to the retail markets in the United States?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, in terms of new product, we had a number of new products but the biggest one would have been MotionSense, which is our hands-free electronic kitchen faucets, a big launch in the fourth quarter both at retail and in wholesale. We also backed that up with some advertising brand spend across a number of channels. So it ended up, really, kind of priming the pump. And consciously did that because we saw a pretty good demand coming into 2013. So that made good sense for us to move that spend into the quarter. We actually moved some spend out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter support that as well. So quite a bit of activity there. In terms of your question on wholesale retail, different markets. Obviously, retail is a big home center business. Some of that goes into new construction, a lot of it is R&R. The wholesale business is showrooms and then builder to builder to support new construction business. We've got a very strong share in that wholesale side of the business with some pretty robust product lines there. So that's real good business for us. It's a business we kept and supported throughout the downturn. So it's performing very well. We've got a terrific team on that side of the business. So I don't know if there's...","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, were the growth rates between the wholesale and retail, were  they substantially different or both in this double-digit number you referred to?","Christopher J. Klein","No, wholesale we've been stronger, really supported by that kind of 20-plus new construction volume. So that business is growing quite strongly. Retail grew fine in the quarter, but was nowhere near growing as strong. So retail probably looked more like a little bit better than the R&R numbers because then we picked up share there, but on the wholesale side, it really is going stronger off of that new construction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company.","Thomas Mahoney","This is Tom Mahoney calling in for Eric this afternoon. My question is on the increase in CapEx for next year from $75 million to $100 million. What are the areas of incremental investments and what's the payback you expect from that over -- and I guess a time frame would be helpful as well.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, we spent gross CapEx in '12 $75 million well below depreciation and amortization, which is a little over $100 million. So we think it's -- and we've always said we would get back to D&A kind of levels of spending when we're confident in the market. Well, we're now pretty confident in the markets so we're going to move it up to about $100 billion, so we'll increase it back to kind of this normal run rate of D&A. It's actually spread across our segments. A lot of it is investments in productivity in our supply chain and plants, a little capacity and some CapEx to kind of drive some sales. So it's -- you'll see it increasing in Cabinets in Plumbing, Security & Storage, a little less in Windows & Doors at this point, but still investments. So it's across the business. And we get strong paybacks on these returns. And you see the productivity improvements we're making when you have 25% to 30% operating margin improvements.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Jim Barrett from CL King & Associates.","James Barrett - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Chris, could you discuss the business in China a bit about the competitive set and how the profitability there compares to your divisional average?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. So, yes, we continue to have a strong performance in China. We added about 200 incremental storefronts. So we're up to about 750 storefronts there. Business there is driven off that traditional retail business, which is the Moen storefront, as well as some direct-to-builder business. So still very strong double-digit growth there. The market has slowed down a bit number but they're still building roughly 5 million housing a year. So not bad business and really the middle-class, they're trading up from pure utilitarian faucets, showering to branded product. And so we're in the right place in the right markets and we're seeing a good lift there. In terms of the competitive set, there are some local players there. We're the third largest import faucet brand. So Kohler, TOTO and then us, and then we are having strong results. We -- the brand is positioned. We built that business over the last 15 years organically and really have touted the fact that we're the #1 faucet in America, and the consumer there is increasingly looking for brands that represent quality, reliability and good value for dollar. And so they find kind of good fashion and yet they get that reliability that they get with our brands. So we like the market. We have a great team there. We're developing products specifically for that market. So we don't bring products out of North America there. There's a design team there that's making the product specifically tailored and it's -- we're having good success. In terms of profitability, as a market that's profitable for us, as we invest in that market, it depresses near-term profitability, but the older stores are profitable, the younger stores, we've got capital going into them and they're in developing marketplaces. So yes, it's profitable. Eventually, will become more profitable as we slow down the growth that. But for now, we're really looking at that as an attractive longer-term business for us. And it's certainly generating profit, which is more than a lot of folks can say about they're investments in China. So we like...","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fortune Brands' 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Brian Lantz, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.","Brian Lantz","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Fortune Brands Home and Security quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress during the third quarter of 2014. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release issued earlier. The news release and the audio replay of the webcast of this call can be found in the Investor section of our fbhs.com website.","I would like to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements we make on the call today is in our prepared remarks or in the associated question-and-answer session are based on current expectations and our market outlook and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC such as our annual report on 10-K.","The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We speak only to the time at which they are made. Any references to operating profit, earnings per share or cash flow on today's call will focus on our results on a before charges and gains basis as described in today's news release unless otherwise specified.","Also, Window business results have now been reflected as a discontinued operation in all periods and are therefore excluded from the results discussed on today's call.","With me on the call today are Chris Klein, our Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Wyatt, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we've allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams delivered solid growth in the third quarter in the face of tough comps in a market that is currently running at the low end of our planning assumption.","We continue to gain share and mix continues to improve and our core businesses are performing well. We're also taking actions to strengthen our portfolio and invest in capacity and capability as we prepare our company to deliver on higher growth as we expect our markets to continue to improve in 2015 and beyond.","Let me first take you through some of the third quarter highlights and briefly discuss some of the steps we are taking to strengthen and focus our portfolio. And I'll comment on our view of the U.S. home products market and our 2014 outlook.","Turning to the quarter, sales were up 5% and EPS was $0.55, up 20% from a year ago. This performance is particularly strong given the challenging comparison to the prior year quarter when sales increased 24% in a more robust market.","Let me give you some highlights by segment. Sales for our cabinets business were up 1% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of both exiting builder direct business in the West and the comparison to a large bath vanity product launch in the third quarter of 2013, core cabinet sales increased 10%. Core cabinet sales growth was led by mid-teens growth in the dealer channel while big ticket remodeling activity remaining strong as well as high single-digit growth in the home centers.","We again gained share in the dealer channel, where we continue to see growth across a full range of semi-custom and custom product lines, resulting in a better mix with higher price points. Our share gains are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers as well as new dealerships.","Our new product launches, including our new Omega frameless custom line for dealers and new bath vanity offerings in home centers, continue to sell well and are driving share gains. Our refreshed Diamond line is performing well above expectations and new finishes in our Aristokraft, Homecrest and Kitchen Craft lines are also selling well.","Despite a challenging third quarter comparison to product line review wins in the prior year, WoodCrafters performance has been solid. From a revenue perspective, WoodCrafters products are selling well. They have captured new program wins in home centers and begun to gain product placements in the dealer channel.","With the integration nearly complete, WoodCrafters is also beginning to help our core cabinet business by producing lower cost componentry for our existing cabinet lines with its low cost North American manufacturing capacity.","So overall, for cabinets, we continue to leverage our proven structural competitive advantages to generate sustainable momentum. Our teams execute well against a business model that is tough to replicate. Our share gains across channels with improving mix reflect the tangible impact of these advantages.","Plumbing reported sales that were up 2% for the quarter led by growth in U.S. wholesale and retail.","In the third quarter of 2014, Moen faced challenging sales in comparison to the wholesale channel. Wholesalers continue to reduce inventory versus our third quarter 2013, in which wholesalers carried inventory to support strong demand. Regardless, this year's mix was better, our sales grew and margins were strong. As a result, our U.S. Plumbing business grew high-single digits across wholesale and retail.","We're encouraged to see consumers continue to select our innovative new faucet products for their new homes and repair and remodel projects, including new pull-out and pull-down faucets with reflex self retraction in our Brookshire, Hensley and Etch lines, sip beverage and filtration faucets and our Oxby bath accessories and faucets.","Overall, we continue to see strength in the more premium end of the market supporting bigger remodel and renovation projects.","International sales declined low-single digits, driven by weakness in Canada, which was negatively impacted by a stronger dollar and in China. China sales declined modestly over the prior year as new construction activity was weaker and direct to builder sales softer. However, our nearly 950 Moen stores continued to generate solid growth as we continue to add stores and rationalize lower performing stores to drive growth.","We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential.","Doors reported sales were up 13% for the quarter. For the first time, we are reporting doors by itself in this segment as we closed on the sale of Simonton windows in the quarter. In the quarter, door products saw healthy sales growth, driven by gains in new construction and ongoing distribution additions. We continue to see an increasing benefit from our expansion in the Western region that we put in place over the last couple of years. Mix also improved especially with consumers selecting our new decorative glass designs and new fiberglass door styles like our recently launched Pulse line of modern entry doors. The furniture brand continues to perform strongly across all channels.","In the Security & Storage segment, sales increased 17% from the prior year quarter. Sales from the Sentry Safe acquisition added significantly to the growth, while organic security sales increased 4% and tool store sales decreased 3%.","Master Lock security sales growth was led by mid-single digit increases in U.S. retail, high single-digit increases in international and solid double-digit growth in U.S. safety.","Master Lock U.S. retail sales continued to grow as program expansions at retailers during the back-to-school selling season.","And Master Lock Europe continued to gain share in a European market that saw mixed results. The Sentry Safe acquisition is on track and the teams are working hard to integrate the operation. We are excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses.","So to sum up our results, our teams executed and continue to gain share in a lower-growth market. As we wrap up 2014, we remain positioned to gain additional share and deliver strong sales and profit growth in 2015 -- 2015 and beyond.","First, in the third quarter, we decided to sell the Simonton Windows business and we're able to close on that sale more quickly than planned. The windows business was subscale within our portfolio and is better positioned to grow inside a larger Windows business.","Meanwhile, we are very focused on driving profitable growth for our Furniture Door business, as you can now see more clearly with these third quarter results. Second, I'm excited about the growth opportunities that we have in our Security business with the addition of Sentry Safe. These opportunities include driving sales and innovation, averaging global distribution and generating cost synergies.","Going forward, as we integrate Sentry, the security segment will operate separately from the Tool Storage business. As a result of integrating Sentry in the Tool Storage business, we are reviewing long-term strategic options given the challenges this segment has seen over the past few years. This business currently has annual sales of approximately $150 million and will be reported separately in the future.","Third, we have continued to invest in capacity and capabilities to allow for additional growth beyond $6 billion in sales. We believe that the new construction market is gradually returning to historical levels in support of household formations and that the R&R market will grow annually at 5% to 6% in a steady-state.","So in 2014, at the same time that we have been taking share and delivering growth in a market that has been growing slower than we assumed earlier in the year, we have also been taking a few steps to position ourselves for the growth we see in the future.","Given our strong positions in these markets, even a modest improvement in market demand gives us a significant impact.","Now let me turn to our updated full year outlook for 2014, starting with our assumptions for the market.","In the near term, the pace of repair and remodel demand has been recovering more gradually than we expected earlier this year. New home construction, where our products are installed in the later stages, has also been slower to reaccelerate since last fall, but continues to pick up pace. And now we have a better view into a good portion of the fall season for both R&R and new construction.","So while demand for both new construction and repair and remodel should still show growth for the balance of the year, we expect the overall U.S. home products market growth for the balance of 2014 will be lower than we assumed in July. Therefore, our updated 2014 annual outlook is now built on a revised assumption that U.S. home products market grows at a combined 4% to 5% rate in the fourth quarter.","Based on that U.S. housing market projection, the assumptions we make for our other markets and continued share gains plus the Sentry Safe acquisition, we continue to expect solid top line growth for 2014 with our full year sales increasing at approximately 80% rate over 2013 and our Home Products business is again outperforming the market for our products.","Based on this market and sales growth and the benefit of share repurchases, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS of $1.84 to $1.86.","So to sum up, we remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the recovering home products market. We are gaining share. Our core businesses are strong and because of actions we are taking in 2104, we are well positioned to deliver even higher growth in 2015 and beyond as the housing market continues its recovery.","We also continue to believe that our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our strong free cash flow.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our 2014 outlook and on our recent capital allocation actions.","E. Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Also, the closing of the sale of the Simonton Windows business was accelerated into the third quarter, which reduced our reported EPS for the third quarter by $0.02.","The Windows business is now reflected as a discontinued operation and its results are excluded for all periods.","Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.1 billion, up 5% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $138 million, up 15% or $18 million compared to the same quarter last year.","EPS were $0.55 for the quarter versus $0.46 the same quarter last year, an increase of 20%.","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $453 million, up $4 million or 1% over the prior year quarter. To better understand the performance of our cabinet business in the third quarter, it's necessary to exclude both the impact of the planned exit of the Builder Direct business in the West, that was $15 million last year, as well as a $14 million inventory loaded in the third quarter of last year due to a large WoodCrafters vanity product launch. Excluding these 2 items, the underlying cabinet sales were up 10%.","Our operating income for the cabinet segment was even with the prior year quarter, it was depressed by $6 million to $7 million by the impact from actions to expand capacity and flexibility across multiple clients. While these actions pressure profit in the quarter, they should provide strong returns beginning in 2015.","Operating margin for the quarter was 8.1%. Full year operating margin is now expected to increase nearly 100 basis points compared to 2013.","Turning to Plumbing. Sales for the third quarter were $346 million, up $8 million or 2%, led by U.S. wholesale and retail. Operating income increased $10 million to $76 million, up 15%. Operating margins for this segment was 22%. The increase above the anticipated annual operating margin of 19% was due primarily to the timing of expenses and improving product mix.","Door sales were $114 million, up $14 million or 13% from the prior year quarter. Operating income for this segment was $12 million, a $5 million improvement from the third quarter last year. Operating margin for the segment increased to 10.6%.","Security & Storage sales, which now includes Sentry Safe, were $185 million in the third quarter, up 17% to the prior year quarter. Organic security sales increased 4%, while sales of storage products decreased by 3%. Segment operating income was $28 million and operating margin for the segment was 14.9%.","As Chris mentioned, now that we are integrating Sentry Safe into our Security business and are beginning to align our cost structure to future growth, we intend to focus separately on a strategic plan for the Tools Storage business.","So to sum up the third quarter performance. The housing market growth was at the low end of our previous guidance. The impact of expanding capacity put pressure on profit. We continue to leverage our structural competitive advantages to drive share gains and our core businesses' performance remains solid.","Before I turn to the balance sheet, I want to reiterate that we're continuing to make investments to build incremental capacity and flexibility. As mentioned on our last call, these investments should enable us to expand capacity and infrastructure to support sales growth as the housing market returns to steady-state levels over the next 3-plus years. We need to make these investments this year so that we are positioned to capture the potential growth and should begin to realize the benefits of these investments later next year.","In the third quarter, these capacity investments were equal to approximately $0.03 of EPS and mainly impacted the cabinet segment.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our September 30 balance sheet remains solid, with cash of $175 million, debt of $684 million and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1x. We have $155 million drawn on a $975 million revolving credit facility, our balance sheet reflects the impact of share repurchases and year-to-date capital expenditures of approximately $82 million.","Turning to share repurchases. We continue to opportunistically repurchase shares with year-to-date purchases of $440 million compared to the $375 million reported on last quarter's call. Additionally, the Board of Directors has authorized an additional $250 million of repurchases over the next 2 years. Together with the prior authorization, the remaining unutilized authorization is approximately $300 million.","Given our cash flow and balance sheet profile, these repurchases should not limit any potential M&A activity in the future as we continue to actively pursue accretive acquisitions.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014. As Chris mentioned, based on our projected 4% to 5% U.S. home products market growth in the fourth quarter, the assumptions we make for other markets and continued share gains, plus the Sentry Safe acquisition and the sale of Simonton Windows, we now expect full year 2014 sales to increase approximately 8% compared to 2013.","Importantly, the investments made in capacity and flexibility and other actions taken this year should position us to continue with above-market sales growth in 2015 and beyond. Our resulting full-year outlook for 2014 EPS are in the range of $1.84 to $1.86. This outlook includes the impact of third quarter actions, including the acquisition of Sentry Safe, the sale of Simonton Windows and share repurchases. It also assumes that our fourth quarter tools storage profit is flat to prior year, as we complete a strategic review of that business in the fourth quarter.","The reduction from our July guidance range is primarily the result of divesting the Window business and the market growth assumption, being at the low end of our previous expectations now that we have better visibility through the fall selling season. We expect 2014 free cash flow to approach $200 million for the full year after expected CapEx of around $120 million as we invest in incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential.","Additionally, the board has authorized the December dividend of $0.12 per share. In summary, the performance of our core business, the investments we've made, the steps we're taking to position our portfolio for future growth and the expected continuing market recovery give us confidence in continued growth beyond 2014.","Importantly, we remain focused on using our strong balance sheet and cash flow to make acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. We're well positioned as we focus on maximizing shareholder value.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks on the third quarter of 2014. We will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask Chris. Chris, speaking to the core business and excluding M&A activity in the past year, what's changed in your outlook since July? What are you seeing in October sales? And how do you feel about demand trends in the core business heading into year-end? Just trying to understand what you're expecting from the consumer as you close out the year.","Christopher J. Klein","Thanks, Bob. Yes, the core business is actually performing quite strong. There's a lot of stuff, obviously, going on in the quarter with Simonton going out, Sentry coming in, an aggressive comp from last year, 24% up. But if we look at the core, the Cabinet business was up 10% across the U.S., Dealer up mid-teens, Home Center up high single, the Plumbing business up high single, mix improving. We saw doors for the first time reported kind of up low teens. And so what we see is some real health in the end market. If I look at the quarter of July, it was a little soft and really the pickup was August, September and through October, we're seeing the same trends we saw in September. So good steady cadence for us. I think there's a bit of share gain in all that. So I'd say the market's okay and we're picking up share across our core markets. And I'd say the consumer -- you've got to kind of segment it a little bit, we still see the higher-end consumer wading in. The mix looks good for the projects that are happening. I think there's still some latent demand out there from entry level, both new construction as well as R&R, and so we think that's going to be coming in '15, '16. So overall, I felt good about the quarter and I think we feel good as we sit here at the end of October. The other thing is, I guess, in the fourth quarter, we've seen different trends over the last few years. Sometimes business slows down by the middle of November. Sometimes it keeps growing through early December. So we're going to wait and see if some of this momentum continues through November. So I say we feel pretty good about things.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's a great update. I wanted to ask Lee, it looks like you're tweaking capital, spending down a little bit. I think you're lowering free cash flow guidance for this year down as well. Wanted to understand the reduction in free cash flow and what are your thoughts about capital allocation and using -- how you intend to use the balance sheet to create value as we head into next year?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, we -- in terms of our forecast for free cash flow, we've come down. It's -- we now say approaching $200 million. Before, it was over $200 million, that's just the result of just taking the expectations, the guidance down for the year. Nothing significant in that reduction. That does include taking CapEx for the year down from about $140 million down to $120 million. That's a combination of some timing and it's also the result of just taking down our expectations for what we're going to have to spend. Recall the last quarter, we said we could probably spend $140 million in '14 and $140 million in '15. Now as we've just sharpened our pencil, got a little more efficient on this, we think we'll probably spend somewhere over $120 million in '14, probably $125 million in '15. So just getting sharper on the pencil on those and just really understanding what we need to spend. So that's actually good news.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sorry, just a follow-up. Thoughts on using the balance sheet for M&A or share repurchases, and what you're looking for leverage. Any clarification or prioritization would be great.","E. Lee Wyatt","We still feel strongly that we need a little more leverage to drive shareholder returns here. We ended the quarter around 1x net debt-to-EBITDA. We still think that at the middle of the recovery we are now, we could lever up to 3, 3.5x by the end of the -- kind of get to steady-state, our preference would be 1.5 to 2x. So have a lot more to do. We -- if you think about 2x leverage at the end of -- when we get to steady-state, that's about $3 billion. And all the actions we've taken to date, we've only committed about $1 billion of that. So we've got a lot of room left. We still like acquisitions if they're accretive and we can get the kind of benefits that we've gotten out of the Sentry Safe and out of the WoodCrafters. We'd do a lot of those. We're still repurchasing shares opportunistically. We've now repurchased $440 million about 11 million shares, so almost 7%. So we're going to do that opportunistically. But -- so it's still a combination of let's look for good acquisitions because we think those can drive the most value but let's still opportunistically repurchase shares as we've done this summer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wanted to ask you guys about the Cabinets business first. So I think you had indicated that the exit of the builder direct and the vanity launch last year, it was $29 million. But I don't think that gets you all the way -- that doesn't completely bridge the gap to get to a 10% organic. I was wondering if there was anything in there or if I heard those numbers wrong. And then also, you had said that last year, I think in the fourth quarter call last year, you said that you thought that the cabinet capacity or the capacity expansion in general in cabinets and plumbing would be about $5 million a quarter. It was kind of split evenly throughout this year. I was wondering whether that has actually come in more lumpily than you expected and maybe that's what drove something here in the third quarter margin, which was lower than we thought.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, I'll take the first piece on the 10% growth in the core cabinet business. Basically, if you take out the builder West exit, which was about $15 million last year in the quarter, obviously, 0 this time, if you take out the $14 million on the inventory movement at WoodCrafters and then there's about $3 million or $4 million other dollars in there kind of related to WoodCrafters, if you do that, you get to the 10%. So if you take out basically the WoodCrafters change and the builder West, you should be at 10%.","Christopher J. Klein","And your second point was around capacity. Interesting, we kind of came into the year planning on capacity additions and had some tremendous success with the launch. We relaunched the Diamond line and some other product enhancements and saw some very strong demand coming in second, third quarters. So we accelerated some things. Basically, the expansion of some facilities, putting additional lines in to produce a different -- kind of the extension off of part of our semi custom line. So incurred a little bit more expense to do that, kind of a high-class problem, we're trying to service all the demand that's coming in. So we're through all that. We're in good position now coming into next year. So we still have some incremental things we're doing within cabinets, some expansion on the WoodCrafters side, around components down in Mexico and some other things we're doing, but on the kind of the big part of the SDK expansion, we actually moved through that a little bit harder and a little bit faster this year. So we're pretty well set coming into next year.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Could you quantify those at all, like how much more was 3Q versus, let's say, 2Q?","Christopher J. Klein","In terms of the overall expense per capital and the expenses associated with capacity enhancement, we're up actually and projecting we'll be up a little bit versus where we were before. We were going to come in about $0.08, we're now projecting we'll be about $0.12 for the total year and capital was projected at $1.40, it will now be about $1.20. So we elongated across the whole business a couple of parts of the capital and capacity increase. But specific to cabinets, we actually accelerated some of that work so we could handle very strong demand coming off of this Diamond relaunch.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl with Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Lee, I wanted to ask, I guess conceptually, about the way that you think about guidance. I know you try to be as straightforward as possible with some of the market and share gain assumptions. But realizing that this is now a couple of quarters in a row where you've had to take down sales a bit and it's probably a period where it's -- there's unusually low visibility in some of the channels. Is there anything that you can be doing differently to gain a little more clarity into the top line? Or how do you think about baking in some cushion in the near term as we continue to deal with a market that is not quite certain here.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. I think there's a couple observations. We try to be down the middle and always start with our market assumption and then we add our share gains to that and give you our sales. So we're not candidly big hedgers. We try to be down the middle of the road on that. One of the issues we always have at the end of the second quarter, when you're sitting at the end of July trying to give guidance is when 65% of your business, your Home businesses is R&R, you're sitting in July and you haven't started and you really don't have good visibility to the fall R&R season, which is significant for us. So that's one of the issues giving guidance at the end of July. You really don't -- you really can't understand the fall R&R season really until you get into October because it's generally September, October, November is the fall season. So that's one of the challenges we have and we try to call that out but it's always going to be a challenge giving guidance at the end of the second quarter. We're generally going to be better when we give guidance at the end of the first quarter and at the end of the third quarter because those were in the middle of the R&R season. So that's just part of our industry. But given that, we don't try to hedge a lot even though in July, we don't know, we just try to give you our best guess at the market. You can challenge that and if you agree or disagree, you can adjust our performance accordingly in your estimates. But we try to be pretty straight up and down the middle of the road and pretty transparent on all that.","Christopher J. Klein","It's the same philosophy we follow really since we came out 3 years ago as a standalone company and that's to say, here's what we're looking at as the market but we know we're not the best forecasters. We do our best, but here's what we're assuming. And then here's how we'll perform in that market and if anybody takes a different view of the market, well, now we've given them the metric to make the adjustment to say, oh, you said you were going to be -- the market was going to be up X percent and you're going to be up X plus 2%. Okay, great. Now I know how to change it if I believe more conservatively that the market will go in a different direction. So that's the kind of philosophy that we try to carry through.","E. Lee Wyatt","The other thing that's been a challenge this year is just with that first quarter weather impact, especially as it relates to R&R, that was just very challenging and I think it's made understanding the normal patterns for R&R, at least in 2014, a little challenging because we never had that situation, where the weather has been that difficult. And it's actually kind of broken the process for planning large R&R big ticket items. So it's -- this has been a challenging year, no doubt.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful and certainly I understand and appreciate the challenges on that side. Just shifting gears, the strategic options on the storage side. I guess what are the options here assuming there aren't so many buyers of a business like this currently? What are the things -- any color you can give around potential outcomes here?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. Yes, that's a business that has not been strategic for a while, but has remained profitable. So it represents not even 4% of our total sales. We decided as we're making some significant moves with Master Lock and Sentry putting those businesses together and really focusing that segment hard on the security side, that it was the right time to really kind of separate the storage business and really look at the parts of that business that are performing better and that's really kind of the commercial and industrial or higher end consumer side of that business versus maybe some of the more valued parts of the business and really kind of thinking through some different scenarios around our go-forward plan there. So we just kicked that work off over the last 1.5 month. We'll talk more about it in January, but we'll be very clear about our plan going forward. We don't want it to be a distraction so that's why we're going to separate it away from the Security business. And that segment, that Security business with Master Lock and Sentry is going to look nice going forward. You're going to see some good growth in margins and it will be very easy to understand. So we think it's the right time to take all that under review.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","My first question is just on the Cabinets business, because of the addition to capacity and the actions you guys have taken this year. As you look forward to next year, if the top line looks somewhat similar to this year, let's say 4%, 5% organic growth, does the business lever like you've always thought about it levering? Or do you need more growth in that because you've added capacity?","Christopher J. Klein","We feel good about the capacity we added. I think we saw some surges this year in demand around some of the new products we're bringing in, really, new programs we're bringing in. So we think we've paced it at the right pace and so we do believe we'll see that kind of leverage that we've talked about, 25% to 30% leverage. The reality is we're gaining some significant share. On the dealer side, this year so far, we've signed up 300 new dealers. We're only shipping to about 20% of them right now, and we'll start with the remaining in the fourth quarter and into next year. We're having some very strong success at the home centers. And so we're just looking out, saying you don't have to believe the market's going to go up that much. But the success we're having out there, we want to make sure that we can service the customer, that our lead time stay in line and we've appropriately expanded, meaning realigns into existing facilities. You're not opening up new plants, requiring huge slugs of business to get the right kind of leverage. So the incrementals look good. I feel good about it. I think in reality, if we -- as I said earlier, we accelerated some of the work this year and worked through some of that a little faster than we thought. And I think that's great because we'll be ready next year and into '16, '17 as well. So that business is performing well. I like the fact we added some capacity.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So I guess, said another way, the lack of market growth or the weakness in the market growth relative to maybe what would have been expected beginning of part of the year really hasn't impacted that? If anything, the share gains that you've had have justified those decisions?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, and the volume kind of came in latter part of the second quarter into the third quarter. We think it will continue to ramp fourth into next year. So it's coming in at the same time the capacity is coming up online. So it's kind of been matched up pretty good. So I think it's come together in the right way. I've always said, we can project in the aggregate but then you got to break it down into the individual lines that are growing and the successes we're having in certain parts of the market and are you matched up on capacity. So we've got different capacity around vanities and stock cabinets versus some semi-custom or high-end custom. And so that could depend on the success we have in the market and we have that matched up. So I think we did a pretty good job of matching that up this year and I feel good about going into next year that we'll be able to handle what's going to come at us.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","And then, Lee, in the fourth quarter, did you give a number that has -- or guidance that embeds any cost for capacity additions of those programs?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, probably modest. Probably it's a couple of cents in the fourth quarter. Chris mentioned $0.11 to $0.12 for the year. There's probably $0.02 or so in the fourth quarter. But we're also having a little easier comps on some of the -- because we've made some -- starting to make some investments in the fourth quarter of last year. So year-over-year, even though we put $0.02 in EPS impacted, probably you won't really see it in the fourth quarter. I expect fourth quarter results to be better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Robert Baird.","Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just looking at the Plumbing business, you've had 2 quarters there where margins have been above 20%. So just as we look forward, what do you think is more of a sustainable run rate in that business? And maybe how much did some of the international weakness this quarter impact the margins in Q3?","Christopher J. Klein","It's going to impact profit. And we also -- there was just some timing on some advertising spend. We rolled some new programs into the fourth quarter. We thought we might spend that in the third quarter, run it up, just roll it into the fourth quarter. So those 2 things elevated it kind of above 20%. We think that's probably kind of a high-teen, 20% is probably about where it should be longer term. And we look obviously at where we're making investments and what the mix is going to be. The other thing that kind of continues to perform well is just overall mix, not just geography, but a higher-end product that's selling through. And as I said earlier in my comments, there's some strength here at the higher-end remodel that we certainly see in cabinets, but we see in faucets, too. Consumers selecting up and that mix continues to go up. Same with entry doors, mix continues to shift up. So all that rolled together contributes, but we're not targeting something kind of in the 22% range going forward. It's a little high. And at some point, we'd rather be investing back into the business and driving for more growth and make that trade off. That's kind of what the trade-off becomes.","Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just in cabinets in Q4, I think the comp on a year-over-year basis from an organic growth perspective is pretty similar. Are there any other one-time items in the year-ago period in Q4 just to be aware of from a growth perspective?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, it -- the fourth quarter comps for cabinets was 34% last year. And even if you back out WoodCrafters, it was 18%. I think the only -- the one thing that is beneficial for this year's fourth quarter is we were starting to make some investments, as I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter. So I think you'll see the fourth quarter for cabinets being better operating margin performance than the third quarter.","Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then maybe just in terms of growth?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, I think the growth will probably be similar to the third quarter.","Christopher J. Klein","The things that some of the, say, the WoodCrafters load in, some of that's going to reoccur not as -- to not quite the same extent but it's still in the fourth quarter. So we'll see that for the entire second half. So I'd say...","E. Lee Wyatt","The last quarter of the builder West will come out through the fourth quarter.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. And there's probably another $13 million of that. We'll be about $50 million for the year and then the builder West exit will be over by the end of the fourth quarter, but both of the those things are going to be reoccurring. So again, I think modest growth similar to the third quarter but profits higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","William W. Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. So my question is with regards to the competitive environment in cabinets especially with regards to the home center channel. One of your public competitors, which you talked about being more aggressive with regards to pricing and promotions, and I just want to get your thoughts around that and how you guys are expecting to respond to that sort of strategy or if you're seeing any sort of elevated levels of promotion at this time.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, it's interesting. It's been almost 2 years since we started to really back down from promotional levels, and we've held them down that level. We've been executing strong just on the basics of the business, new products and programs, quality, reliability, service, support designers and with a lower level of promo than both of our competitors in the home centers, we continue to gain share. I mean it was pronounced in the third quarter and I'd just say, I guess, there's periods of time when we're succeeding and competitors feel like the only thing they got left is to promote and we're ready for that because of our execution. I'd say we'd rather be investing our resources in product, in service, in some capacity and in working with designers and that's a good use of our expense to long-term build the business as opposed to onetime promotions. So we'll continue to hold the line and be tough because it's working and we're winning. So that's about all. Obviously we react to whatever competitors are going to do in the marketplace, but we felt pretty confident because we got some really good teams out there in the market doing great work.","William W. Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And just with regards to the M&A pipeline, just wondering how you're seeing that stack up relative to July? And also, sort of your confidence level in terms of maybe a bolt-on acquisition in the next 12 or 18 months?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, the M&A market continues to be -- there's opportunities out there. There's things we're working on. I'd note that we did sell Simonton in the quarter and bought Sentry. So the team was kind of busy over the summer and -- but they're continuing to look at other things and I'd say, it's a reasonable market and there's discussions that we're having. And I can't ever project whether those will be fruitful or not, but I would just say if the pace of discussions are out there and there's a number of different things that we're looking at, if any of those come to fruition, that's great. So I'd say there is some activity. It has picked up relative to where we were kind of at the beginning of the year and expect that pace will continue over the next 18 months. So we'll continue to look at both of our core businesses and near adjacencies and we do see some opportunities out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Lee, if you could clarify, just 2 housekeeping questions before I ask my bigger one. But you talked about the security margin in the fourth quarter. I picked up the word flat. Was that EBIT? Was that a margin? Could you clarify? And what do you expect the full year diluted share count to be?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. What we said was in giving our guidance, we are assuming for just the Tool Storage business, that the fourth quarter profit will be equal to last year because we're beginning that strategic review. So at this point, the easiest thing for guidance is just to say, let's assume it's flat with last year. So that's what we meant. It's not Master Lock, it's not Sentry. It's just the tool storage. And I'd say, for next year, I'd say, shares on a fully diluted basis, right now it looks like 161 million to 162 million shares.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You were referring -- you said next year. You mean 2014?","E. Lee Wyatt","Well, for '14, I'd say, for the fourth quarter, I'd use 162 million roughly. You don't get the full average. I think we're going to use 166 for the full year of '14. I think next year is a little more like the fourth quarter of 161 million or so.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Good. I wonder -- realizing you're investing in the business for growth, is there a way that you could kind of talk about maybe -- you talked about the builder business cabinets in the West or load-ins or plumbing, is there a way or is the long term kind of 30% incrementals, which you've done quite well delivering over time, I would say, and if you call out kind of these one items, do we still kind of get to that range? Is there something that you're aware of? We're in October as you look into kind of the first half of '15 that would kind of cause a lot of variance off of that roughly 30% incrementals that many people think about for your business operations? I mean is there anything that you can kind of just, on the horizon, highlight so we don't necessarily have margin -- the lower margin incrementals and one might think that you know of currently?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. We will -- remember, our planning assumption is around 25% incremental margins until we get back to the kind of steady-state housing market and that's our planning assumption. As we give guidance at -- on the next call for 2015, we'll generally tell you then what our expectations for the incremental margins are. And it's historically been 25% to 30%. It's 30% if we're not investing as much. It's 25% if we're investing fully. So we'll tell you at the end of the next quarter when we give you our guidance.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. And I believe for kitchen cabinets, for this year, you did talk about you expected margins to be up roughly 100 basis points year-over-year for the fiscal year on moderate growth in the fourth quarter, right?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Could you just clarify so we know the scope of the fourth quarter change in your view, the 4% to 5% end market forecast, what were you assuming previously? And I'm curious what the dealers are telling you now in the sense of earlier, it seems like they were pointing to traffic growth that didn't materialize. So is that sort of -- do you view that as pent-up or does that -- maybe we're in a lower growth backdrop?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, when we gave our guidance at the end of July, we were looking at a U.S. home market for the full year of 6% to 8%. So for this -- when we just gave guidance, it's really now just about the fourth quarter. So we said 4% to 5% in the fourth quarter. I think if you looked at the second half of the year, we're saying it's probably 4% to 6% for the entire second half. So it was 6% to 8% before, now it's kind of this 4%, 4.5% to 6%. That's when we said we're kind of at the low end of our market guidance before.","Christopher J. Klein","In terms of the Cabinet business on the dealer side, the Dealer business was up mid-teens for the quarter. There's still pretty good traffic going through the showrooms. Our home centers' special orders is up high single-digits. So that's about what we would've expected. So I don't think it's softer than expected. Yes, some of that is share gains, but I do think there's activity out there. Is it at a kind of rapid pace? No. I mean I think there's still some upside there, but I wasn't disappointed with the activity kind of flowing through the showrooms and setting up a reasonable fall season for us.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just to clarify, I think last quarter you discussed in plumbing the margins were helped by promotions that got deferred into the third quarter from second quarter. And it just seems like you probably didn't see those with 22% margins. Can you just clarify that?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. It wasn't promotions. It was ad spending primarily. So as we looked at our business, we basically said it probably makes more sense to run the ads in the fourth quarter. Last time, when we reported the second quarter, we said probably happens in the third. As the guys looked at it a little closer, they said let's just bundle it in the fourth quarter. So it was -- it's just really the timing of some of the annual ad spending is really what drove that. The other thing that drives it candidly is in our business, you have to earn expenses and investments. So when your top line is a little slower, we spend a little less. So 22% is high. I'd say for the fourth quarter, I would think it would be 20% or less. And for the full year, it will be somewhere between 19% and 20%.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Great. And then just finally, I'm curious if you can comment in terms of how much of the share gains you're seeing in cabinets is coming from the Diamond launch versus just other general product innovation. And within the dealers, are you actually gaining shelf space or is it just consumers flocking to your products?","Christopher J. Klein","So it's a combination of things. The Diamond launch is specific. That's primarily flowing through the home center channel. The dealer side was not that heavily impacted by that. So the dealer side was just more fundamental demand and I think there it is both us picking up new dealers as well as going deeper into the dealers that we have. So if we had 1 line there expanding that to 2 lines or 3 lines incrementally, and that's just something we've been working on over the last 4 or 5 years. But we saw some pretty good success with it this year in particular in that marketplace. So you set it up either kind of one at a time and you're working through it and as we perform well and deliver on expectations to give us more business. So kind of earned our way through all that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East with the ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, if you look at your business with all the moving pieces that are going on and also the slowdown in the new construction, what would you say your split of business is now moving forward with new construction versus R&R?","Christopher J. Klein","We're at probably 65, 35 right now, R&R, new construction. I think going into next year, we'll talk a little bit about what our assumptions are but you could see some pickup on new construction that would shift some of that. The only other moving piece in all that was Simonton was a little more R&R. So that will come out but furniture is also growing at a pretty significant pace and that's more tilted toward new construction. So that might tilt us a little bit more toward new construction, but not dramatically more.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I've got you. And then just 2 other questions. When you look at that mid-teens improvement in the dealer network, how much of that do you think is actually incremental demand flowing through that channel versus you all taking market share?","Christopher J. Klein","I think it's both. I mean I think there's some incremental demand. If I look at kind of the strength across product lines and segments from all the way to high end at Omega and Decor\u00e1, down through the middle of the market and then down into our stock programs, Aristokraft, you're kind of competing against different folks at each of those and we're picking up share across. So I'd say some of it is we're taking it away from some individual competitors, but some of it's just more widespread strength of us working with the best dealers in the markets that we're in, working hard with those dealers and executing well. So it's -- dealers just -- it's thousands of accounts. So you've got to be doing a lot of things right in a lot of places to see that kind of improvement on a consistent basis. And we've been -- I mean we look at our comp last year overall in the Cabinet business even taking WoodCrafters out, we were up 18% in the third quarter last year. And so it will be up again mid-teens in -- on the dealer side of the market. We're just doing a lot of good things year-over-year and taking advantage of whatever growth there is out there.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I've got you. And then just last question. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, talking about Sentry Safe, you thought there was some -- you didn't use the word synergy, but I'll use that. I guess as you look at integrating between Master Lock and Sentry Safe, what are the opportunities when we sit here and look at revenues, manufacturing, overlapping sales, marketing forces, that type of thing?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. I mean it's early. We just closed on it in late July, but we see opportunities across all of those on the revenue side. There are product applications that work with locks and security devices on a Master Lock that also work within the safe. So electronics is a big area that we can leverage across both. There's distribution. So there's some cross pollination on distribution that we can leverage between the 2 that should give us some incremental revenue growth. On the cost side, there will be some synergy. We took some expense out of Master Lock as we re-prioritize some things even here in the fourth quarter. And so we see some rationalization there, both back-office as well as kind of the manufacturing side. So we think bringing those 2 together, frankly, it will be easier to understand now moving the storage side out, you'll have a clear picture of both revenue growth there and we'll talk about that next call about kind of our outlook on the business, but we'll be more specific about where those opportunities are. But I'm pretty excited about that business. I think that the 2 of them together are going to yield some pretty good impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just want to go back to the market adjustment changes. How much of the change was due to R&R versus the new construction? You sound pretty positive on R&R, at least how that's coming through the last couple of months. So I want to understand that better. And just on cabinets, clearly faced some headwinds this quarter and next quarter. Is this -- is cabinet growth or the market growth on the low -- not the market, but your growth in low-single digits, was that close to what you're expecting or is it much about what you're expecting much better than the market growth, which is lower.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. I'd say on the reduction in the market outlook in our guidance, I think we are fairly positive on R&R. I think -- we took it down a little, I'd call it 50 basis points or something from -- in the second half from what we'd originally thought. New construction, we took down much more. And in terms of the cabinet growth in the fourth quarter and in the third quarter, it's relatively close to what we thought once we understood the R&R. Remember, it's the R&R market that drives so much of that Cabinet business for us and it's through that dealer channel. So as we understood more, it felt right. We had some headwinds, as we've talked about, with the inventory builds and WoodCrafters and exiting the builder West that we knew. So we -- those were right on track to what we thought. So it came in pretty much where we thought given that the market is a little softer.","Operator","We've reached the allotted time for questions for today's call.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein","Thank you, Brian. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams executed well in the first quarter, as we handled the challenges of extreme weather and anticipated lower level of new construction. We remain well positioned to deliver strong growth this year and offset some of the first quarter weather impact, as the pace of demand reaccelerates. Our 2014 annual outlook has been updated to reflect the impact of first quarter weather on our business and calls for profitable growth based on our continued share gains and recovering markets for new construction, and repair and remodel activities for the balance of 2014.","Let me first take you through our view of current market conditions and provide some insights on the impacts of weather. Then I will cover some of the first quarter highlights. And finally, I'll wrap up with our updated 2014 annual outlook. Our view on the fundamental market for our products over the next several years is very much the same as when we entered 2014, as we continued to see signs of strength in the overall home products market, despite the near-term disruptions from weather.","The demand for new construction is outstripping supply in many markets across the country. And developers are preparing for significant growth in 2014 and beyond. While last summer's increase in mortgage rates, combined with higher home prices, continues to impact the pace of new construction, the market for new homes is still expected to show double-digit growth in 2014. Housing inventory remains low, mortgage rates have remained stable over the past 9 months and single-family homes are at historically affordable levels.","More importantly, in the repair and remodel market, which is around 65% for our home business, we have seen a continuation of the strong growth that we saw in the fall season. Now to break the regions not impacted by severe weather, we saw double-digit sales growth for bigger ticket semi-custom and custom cabinets. We also saw increased project size and stronger demand for more premium faucets in our Moen wholesale showrooms. Despite the strength we see in the long-term home products market, the first quarter was significantly impacted by severe winter weather. In our businesses, we have done detailed work to estimate that this unusually severe weather negatively impacted our sales by $4 million and EPS by $0.08 in the quarter. So it's important that I take just a few moments to provide a better understanding of exactly how the weather impacted our businesses.","From a revenue prospective, overall consumer shopping behavior was clearly tempered in those areas impacted by severe weather and there are 3 important points that I'd like to make here around what happened in these parts of the country. First, the weather broke down the consumer planning and purchase process. Current homeowners' ability to design, plan, shop and start significant remodel projects was constraining in the challenging conditions. Specific to our business, large remodel projects involving kitchens, bathrooms, windows and doors require significant activity around the home and are not easy to undertake in extreme weather. And new homebuyers were not out ordering or buying new homes at the rate they otherwise would have been. Second, approximately 50% of our revenues come from the Midwest and Northeast regions, which were the areas heavily affected by the severe weather. And third, our sales in these regions were down 3%, when compared to the milder winter of 2013. This was substantially weaker than the double-digit increases we experienced in the remainder of the U.S, which had a more normal winter and continued on a pace consistent with the second half of last year.","From an operating perspective, our ability to efficiently make and deliver product was significantly restricted in the region affected by severe weather. For example, not only were there challenges of getting trucks in and out of markets on certain days, but production was disrupted by less than full shifts or even complete closures. Some locations dealt with frozen pipes and some of our cabinet facilities struggled with the impact of low humidity levels, as the buildings were being constantly heated, which caused some hardwood to split and increased scrap. In the Midwest and Northeast, consumer traffic is now increasing and consumers have begun to plan and design remodel projects, as evidenced by the number of quotes being generated and activity reported in our dealer network. So we remain focused on gaining share, as demand begins to reaccelerate this spring. We are also encouraged by the strong performance in those areas of the country not impacted by severe weather, where we have seen continued momentum.","Turning to the quarter. Total reported sales were up 9%, but we estimate sales would have increased 13%, excluding the impact of weather. Let me give you some highlights by segment. Sales for our cabinets business were up 19% for the quarter. Cabinet sales growth was driven by WoodCrafters and the dealer channel, where big ticket remodeling activity remains strong. We again gained share in the dealer channel, where we saw strong double-digit increases in the regions not impacted by severe weather and continued to see growth across a full range of semi-custom and custom product lines, resulting in a better mix with higher price points. We're also launching several new products this year, including our refreshed Diamond line, new bath [indiscernible] offerings in home centers and a new Omega framework [ph] custom line for dealers. We continue to leverage our proven structural competitive advantages to generate sustainable momentum.","If we exclude the sales from WoodCrafters, the impact from the planned exit of low-margin builder-direct business in the west and the impact from weather, underlying cabinet sales were estimated to be up 13%. Plumbing reported sales that were even with the prior-year quarter, led by Europe's wholesale in China. In the first quarter of 2014, Moen faced a challenging sales comparison to last year's first quarter, where we posted a 26% gain for the total business. More specifically, the wholesale business was comping against a 40%-plus increase in the first quarter 2013, which was driven by emerging demand for new homes and wholesalers building inventory throughout the quarter in anticipation of strong demand in the first half of last year.","In the first quarter of this year, our U.S. wholesale channel was buying only based on current new construction product orders and had not yet started to build inventory to meet future demand. As a result, our sales in the channel grew only 5%. However, we are encouraged to see the continued improvement in the product mix, as consumers continue to select new faucet packages for their new homes, with our more premium products, including our MotionSense hands-free faucet, which continues to be introduced in additional styles, contemporary kitchen pull-down styles in the align and still [ph] collections. Our Aris [ph] modern suite and our new Brookshire traditional kitchen pull up. Moen retail also faced strong double-digit 2013 comps and extreme weather, but continued to benefit from consumer-driven innovations rolled out in Q4, including our new Walden and [indiscernible] pull-out faucets, with reflex self-retraction and faucets with our Microban finishes.","Internationally, sales in China, where there are more than 900 Moen-branded stores, were again up double digits over the prior year, driven by the improved performance of the existing Moen stores in our direct-to-builder efforts. We estimate that total plumbing sales increased 3%, excluding the impact of weather. Windows and doors reported sales were up 5% for the quarter. Door products saw healthy sales growth of 8%, driven by gains in new construction and our ongoing distribution expansion. We continue to see an increasing benefit from our distribution improvement and expansion in the Western region that we put in place over the last couple of years.","Mix also improved, especially with consumers selecting our new decorative glass designs and new door styles, like our recently launched Pulse line of modern entry door styles. Door sales growth is estimated at 14%, excluding the impact of weather. Window sales were even with the prior year. Window sales growth was estimated at 6%, excluding weather, and we saw a continued progress in this market in the west.","In the security and storage segment, our reported sales increased 3% to the prior-year quarter. Security sales were up 4% from the prior-year quarter, led by increases in U.S. retail, international and safety, while storage increased 2%. Master Lock U.S. retail sales continued to grow, with program expansions at retailers. And Master Lock's rollout of new commercial electronic access control solutions designed to secure high-value sites, such as cellular telephone towers and other storage facilities, again contributed to our sales gains.","So to sum up our results, our teams executed well in a challenging quarter. With the first quarter behind us, we remained positioned to continue our share gains and deliver a strong full year of sales and profit growth. So now, let me turn to our updated full year outlook for 2014, starting with our assumption for the market. We will then take you through our specific full year 2014 guidance in more detail in a few moments. Our updated 2014 annual outlook is built for revised assumption that the U.S. home products market grows at a combined 9% to 10% annual rate.","In the first quarter, consumer traffic remained robust in regions not impacted by weather. Importantly, traffic, quotes and orders are now beginning to increase in the Midwest and Northeast, where consumers are now able to focus on planning and designing their large remodel projects. New-home construction, where our products are installed in later stages, is also expected to reaccelerate. So as we begin to build momentum through the second quarter, we believe that we are positioned to have an even stronger second half of the year than initially planned.","Based on that U.S. housing market projection, the assumptions are made for our other markets and continued share gains. We continue to expect solid top line growth for 2014, with our full year sales increasing at a 10% to 12% rate over 2013, and our home products businesses growing faster, and again outperforming the market for our products. Based on this market sales growth, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS of $1.90 to $1.99.","So to sum up, we remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the recovering home products market and intend to deliver strong profitable growth in 2014. We believe that our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our strong free cash flow: by investing in our businesses, pursuing accretive strategic acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our 2014 outlook.","E. Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains, which best reflects ongoing business performance. Before I describe our first quarter results and revised full year outlook, let me summarize some factors that impacted our results in the quarter. First, our 2013 first quarter performance provided a challenging time [ph], as our home segment sales grew 16% in that quarter and EPS tripled to $0.24. Second, extreme weather negatively impacted our results. The magnitude of the impact required that we quantify this to better understand both the first quarter run rate of our business, as well as forecast performance for the balance of 2014. So in early February, each of our businesses began preparing detailed bottoms up reviews of performance by region. The resulting estimates were relatively consistent, with the Northeast and Midwest regions performing substantially below other regions.","As Chris mentioned, in these 2 regions, sales declined 3% in the quarter, while the other regions experienced double-digit growth. The total impact for these 2 regions was estimated at $40 million in sales and $0.08 in EPS, $0.06 from lower sales and $0.02 from production inefficiency. And third, given our continued confidence in the longer-term growth and the demand for housing, we need to begin to invest in capacity as we said last quarter.","Now for our first quarter reported results. Sales were $966 million, up 9% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income in the quarter was $65 million, up 4%, or $3 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.25 for the quarter, versus $0.24 the same quarter last year. Importantly, excluding the estimated impact of weather, total company net sales would have increased by 13%, operating income by $22 million or 35% and EPS by $0.09 or 38% compared to last year.","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $411 million, up $66 million or 19% over the prior-year quarter, led by WoodCrafters and growth in dealers. Operating income for this segment increased to $20 million, up $5 million, as we benefited from higher sales volume, WoodCrafters and on improving mix from repair and remodel growth. Excluding the estimated impact of weather, operating income would have been $30 million, or roughly double the prior-year quarter, and operating margin around 7%, over 200 basis points higher than the same quarter last year. For the full year 2014, our cabinet team has the potential to generate operating margin approaching 10% after investments.","Turning to plumbing, sales for the first quarter were $310 million and operating income was $55 million, both relatively even with the prior-year quarter. Operating margin was 17.9%. Excluding the estimated impact of weather, operating income would have been $60 million, up 10%, and operating margin approaching 19%, over 100 basis points higher than the same quarter last year. For the full year 2014, Moen has the potential to generate low double-digit sales growth with operating margin expanding 100 basis points from 2013 after investments. Windows and door sales were $130 million, up $6 million or 5% from the prior year quarter. Operating loss for this segment, which is normally the first quarter, was $8 million, an improvement from the first quarter last year. Excluding the estimated impact of weather, operating loss was $3 million better than the same quarter last year. For the full year 2014, windows and doors has the potential to generate low double-digit sales growth and expand operating margin.","Security & Storage sales were $115 million in the first quarter, up 3% to the prior-year quarter. Segment operating income was relatively even at $12 million, with security increasing $2.6 million. So to sum up the first quarter performance, we continue to leverage our structural competitive advantages to drive share gains and are continuing to see better mix, driven by the improving R&R market.","Before I turn to the balance sheet, I want to point that out we also made significant investments in the quarter to begin building incremental capacity. As mentioned on our last call, these investments should enable us to expand capacity and infrastructure to support sales growth to around $6 billion, and EPS to over $3 over the next 3-plus years. We will begin to realize the benefits of these investments later next year, but we needed to take steps now and begin implementation, so that we're positioned to capture the potential growth. These capacity investments in the first quarter will equal to $0.04 of EPS and mainly for expenses related to planning, designing and the early stages of implementing incremental capacity for the cabinet and plumbing segments. Beginning in the second quarter, we will pace additional investments with the pace of the recovering market. Approximately $0.08 of incremental investments pending is reflected in our EPS guidance for the full year, including the $0.04 we spent in the first quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our March 31 balance sheet remains solid, with cash of $124 million, debt of $485 million and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 0.7x. It's normal to use the revolver early in the year, so we have $125 million drawn on our $650 million revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we repurchased $69 million of our shares.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2014. As Chris mentioned, based on our projected 9% to 10% U.S. Home product market growth, the assumptions we make for other markets and continued share gains, we now expect our full year 2014 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2013. Our resulting expectations for full year 2014 EPS are now in the range of $1.90 to $1.99. The midpoint of our guidance represents an increase of 30% over 2013 EPS of $1.50. We expect 2014 free cash flow to be at least $250 million for the full year, after CapEx of approximately $130 million to $140 million, as we begin to invest in incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential. Additionally, our quarterly dividend payment was increased to $0.12 per share beginning with our March payment. And the board has now authorized a June dividend of $0.12.","In summary, after considering the impact of challenging 2013 comps and the extreme weather, our first quarter performance and the expected continued market recovery give us confidence for 2014 growth, but also for potential growth beyond 2014, as we continue to benefit from our structural competitive advantages. Importantly, this sustainable momentum in both the housing market and in our business performance should allow us to create incremental shareholder value by making select acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase. I'll now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks in the first quarter of 2014. We will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Could you just give us a little sense, since the end of the quarter, on a regional basis, what you're seeing from demand? And on a regional basis and how you're thinking about the consumer demand trends unfolding in R&R purchases during the balance of the year?","E. Lee Wyatt","Sure. We're actually encouraged that in the parts of the country that were frozen in the first couple of months of the year, we are seeing more activity there. I'd actually bifurcate it a little bit and say that through our dealer network, we're actually seeing good orders coming through, a lot of activity. On the retail side, we're seeing a lot of activity and a lot of bids, but we're still kind of watching for those to get converted into orders. So I'd say the general pace is good. And what we're watching for is that to continue through the quarter and that will build into the balance of the year. So it was encouraging because we saw that kind of activity in the non-snow belt regions. And it very much felt like a continuation of last year in most parts of the country. And yet we started to observe in late January or early February, wow, this is going to be significant. And we started to really dig in. And now we're pleased to see that there's kind of a return back. Big question will be, how much do you get this year? But we're optimistic we'll pick up quite a bit of it this year. It just means we're going to have a stronger second half of the year. We'd already thought we'd have a strong second half. And this will be even stronger.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Got it. And if I could ask Lee. Lee, could you expand a little bit on your comments about reinvesting in the business. You had mentioned that there's tighter capacity, which sounds like utilization is up across your business lines. Can you just give us an idea of how much is real CapEx and what's going to flow through the P&L and kind of where utilization is? Just to frame it, so we know how to think about it for the rest of the year?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, utilization right now, of course, it's seasonal, but that's fine, that's fine for '14 and it's fine for majority of '15. This capacity is really for 24 to 36 to 48 months from now. As we've always said, as we approach $5 billion in revenue, we'd need to increase capacity. If you kind of take the midpoint of our guidance this year, it gets you to $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, so we're there. And you always need to improve, when you're talking about manufacturing capacity, you really need to start that 18 to 24 months in advance. So that's what we're doing. What you're seeing in the first quarter was primarily P&L-related expenses. Those are planning, those are designing, and some very early stages of shifting some capacity around just for planning purposes. So you didn't see a lot of CapEx. The CapEx will start flowing a little bit later in the year. From a P&L perspective, on the last call we talked about $0.08 and it's primarily Moen and cabinets. And so we saw $0.04 of that. We just wanted to get ahead of the planning and the design and some very early stages of moving, because we needed to get that started. We can pace the balance of the year, the additional $0.04, because we have $0.08 in our guidance, that additional $0.04 now we can start pacing, and the CapEx will get paced as we move through the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe just a quick follow-on to Bob's question and also appreciate all the color that you've provided on the weather impact. But maybe if we think about, back to the fourth quarter of last year, do you have a quantification of the sales trends in those regions, relative to the overall increase? Just so we can have even more confidence that it really is just a weather impact here?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, we didn't see any impact in the fourth quarter, regionally, that was different. And I think we normally see more concentration in R&R in the Midwest and Northeast because of the housing stock's a little bit older so you do see a different pace there. But what we're doing is comparing 2 normal trends. This is a sequential quarter-to-quarter. This was for a normal seasonal trend and where our expectation was for the macro market, how were we performing relative to that expectation. And in the non-snow belt areas, we performed to our expectation, to our market projection and delivered as we would have thought in that season. In the areas that were impacted, it was significant. We're talking difference between down 3% versus in the other areas of the country, up low-teens. So you've got a material impact. We also built it account-by-account, region-by-region to validate it. So we did it bottoms up and then we stepped back and looked at it against a formula, if you will, of our market assumptions relative to the seasonal demand that should have been driving through there and it tied it out. So we started monitoring this in late January, as it started unfolding, and started trying to react appropriately and so we've been tracking it now for kind of through. And we actually saw it then start to improve and that gave us confidence as well. Okay, now we're starting to move back to trend line, back to what we would have expected in those areas. And so you have confidence that you've measured the cause and effect.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. I guess what I was looking at was just the 16% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter for the total business. Would it have been fairly even across regions? Or has there been a -- are we just seeing lower growth generally in the Northeast and Midwest?","E. Lee Wyatt","You really have to look at R&R versus new construction. So as Chris said in his comments, over 50% of our sales in the first quarter of last year were in those 2 regions, the Midwest and the Northeast, and a lot of that is R&R-related, the age of the housing stock much greater in the Northeast, much more concentrated. So we didn't really see any change in general direction, like for R&R, we saw a strong second half of last year. We saw that continue into the first quarter in those areas that weren't impacted by the weather. But when the Northeast is impacted by weather and it impacts R&R in such a big deal, I think that's what generates a lot of the profit impact. So kind of normal when you look at it.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. On the cabinets exits in the builder business, could you just remind us how we should think about that for the next couple of quarters before -- or as you're getting closer to lapping that? And maybe what was the specific impact of that in this quarter?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. The exit of the direct-to-builder was basically in the Southwest area. That's low margin new construction cabinetry for us. And it follows our kind of our general approach to business is we're going to be disciplined, we don't need to chase low margin business, so we made the proper notices last fall, fourth quarter, exited it starting this year. In the quarter, first quarter, it was about $10 million impact on cabinets, negative impact.","Christopher J. Klein","On revenue.","E. Lee Wyatt","On revenue. And then for the balance of the -- for the full year, it's probably going to be $50 million to $60 million. We're assuming that offset by share gains though, that are really going to help offset some of those pieces.","Christopher J. Klein","Part of that is that capacity is then freed up to be used either in more profitable parts of the country, direct-to-builder, or is being utilized through the dealer channel. So the P&L impact is quite modest. That was not attractive business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to be clear, how much of this lost $0.08 are you actually incorporating in your guidance to be gained back? And maybe the 2Q specifically. I mean, are we talking pretty much all of it to be regained?","E. Lee Wyatt","Well you really have to break the $0.08 down. $0.06 was sales related and $0.02 was actually production inefficiencies. So we won't get that $0.02 back, basically. So when we think about that, we took our guidance, we narrowed that guidance from $1.91 EPS to $2.01, now to $1.90 to $1.99. So slightly narrow, basically around those things. We took our sales guidance from originally 11% to 13% growth for the year down to 10% to 12%. So we'll get most of that back either through a combination based on our market assumptions for the year, based on sales and some cost controls as we move to, we tried to hit our guidance. And so we'll work hard either from a cost control or from a sales.","Christopher J. Klein","We're also assuming a significant part of that isn't flowing back in the second quarter. It's flowing back through the balance of the year, and especially into the second half. What we're seeing in the business right now is a gradual improvement and a ramping up and literally week-to-week. This week is better than last week was better than the week before. So it's starting to catch and I think that's going to flow through. We're assuming we're just going to have a busier second half. Typically you'd see July would be kind of quiet. December would be kind of quiet, as the market's absorbing some of this demand, we think you could just have a busy 6 months the whole second half of the year. So that's the way we've kind of played it through the business and that's the expectation we've got, as we're running the business.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then as a sort of a follow-on to that, relates to the way in which the business is returning. One of the things that we've been hearing from several other places is that the recovery is -- the rebound from the depressed weather effect is being regained, but it does seem to be somewhat gradual, doesn't seem to be like all at once. And I'm curious as to whether or not you think that there could be another factor also at work, for example, the housing market did sort of slow for reasons that appear to be maybe other than just weather. And I was curious as to whether you see any evidence that there has been some slowness or deterioration in the rate of growth, due to simply the housing market sort of recovering from the massive price increases that went through and maybe even some of the lagging effect of interest rates last year?","Christopher J. Klein","I think that is still the case and that was what we had expected would be the case coming through and in our plans for the first and second quarter, there is a lag in our business. So the slowdown you would have seen in the fall would be playing through right now. And that's what we expected. So that was an issue and I think that is impacting businesses like Moen on the wholesale side, where we expected we would see a slower first quarter and rolling through. We expect that the housing market will be growing this year. Our expectation is that we'll be up on new construction kind of in the low- to mid-teens type range and therefore there is going to be strong demand in that part of the market. We have very strong share with Moen on the builder side of the market, with NBCI and some parts of the direct-to-builder business, as well as through dealers. So certainly, furniture [ph] as well. So we will see that contributing to a stronger second half and that will gradually be comping against what will be weaker numbers as well. So that is definitely flowing through and -- is but that was expected. We would have been talking about that. In any case, we would have been discussing that right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I guess the first question would be along the lines of the cabinet business, where you are walking away from builder business. You mentioned you're essentially picking up business elsewhere and it's essentially a capacity decision. But can you maybe just walk through in a little bit more detail what you're seeing with respect to price in the builder channel? It seems like it's maybe more competitive than other areas that are getting price and maybe your outlook, Chris, on what that might be over the next year or 2 as more competitors work into a tougher capacity situation?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. The decision we made in the West on the builder-direct business was not a kind of a short-term decision. It was something we've been looking at for a long time. The builder-direct business requires certain of our cost structure that we've got to support that business. And in other regions in the country, the product mix supports that. There's slightly higher price point cabinets. There's more margin there to support that cost structure. In the Southwest, the product going in was just at a price point that had trouble supporting the cost in that market and we struggle with it, others struggle with it as well. It was a part of some of the competitors -- there was a competitor that went out of the business down there. Others have reduced their exposure to those markets. And so it was really a market price point in that part of the market discussion. That's not the case with all the houses being built in those markets. We've got a very strong dealer business in those markets, where we're selling higher price-point product, with the kind of appropriate level of support. And so, it really was -- it was something we had been working through for a while. And to the extent that, that market didn't support that. I'd say, your broader question around does the builder market -- attractive for us to be serving? I'd say absolutely. There are places especially in the kind of East, Midwest, Southeast, where we have very strong direct-to-builder business, terrific relationships, profitable for us, good partner for them. And so no issues there. And certainly then, through our dealer network, we're supporting smaller builders. And those builders building more -- more upscale houses, very attractive product mix. So I'd say the builder business is a good business, it was just this piece was something that we just looked at and said longer term it's not a price point which will support the level of service that we feel. We need to be an NBCI company. I'd say, that's part of our proposition, is the level of service we provide. Others may not need to do that, others may feel comfortable not providing everything we do. And so then maybe that price point works for them. But that just doesn't work for us, in the way we support that business.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","So would you say within the cabinets business, if you were to compare that against some of your other products that are particularly new construction focused, do we have more or less pricing power within cabinets versus others?","Christopher J. Klein","I'd say we do fine where the markets are healthy and that I'd say the balance of the country is pretty healthy. So everything going through the dealer channel looks good and in fact, a lot of the strength that we're seeing has come through that. And then the direct-to-builder business in the other parts of the country, I'd say we do just fine. A lot of that we roll through as new products, new finishes and so I think it's appropriate, it's good balance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first question I just had was going back to guidance for a second. I think we kind of summed it up in that it appears that the primary change in the EPS is that $0.02 of the extra costs that you parsed out of the $0.08 hit. But also you had, I guess, sales to your home products' markets down by 1 point, which would imply maybe another incremental small hit. So is there anything going on that's maybe offsetting that, as you think about that and maybe we're getting a little too granular, but it seems like there was maybe a couple of little minor negatives and -- but EPS really didn't come down as much as you would think perhaps?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, I think those are small pennies here or there. But it's primarily -- we'll get better leverage as we grow 10% to 12% our sales, we'll get some leverage around that. And we'll also -- if we will continue as the market comes back to pace our cost. Now we'll still make our investments for capacity over the next 2 to 4 years. But there are other places we'll be thoughtful if the sales aren't quite as good, where we can control some cost in that equation. So our goal is to hit our guidance.","Christopher J. Klein","And the mix was a little bit better. That was one of the positives coming out of the quarter, as we continue to see some good mix trends that we saw coming out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter, even on the volume that was there.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And that's helpful, Chris. Just, I guess, flowing into the second question. On cabinets, I guess you mentioned that you expect the lost builder-direct business to be about $50 million, $60 million for the year. But I just want to make sure I heard correctly that you expect that to be offset by share gains and being a lower margin business that's kind of baked into your full year outlook of approaching 10%?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. Yes, the exited business is definitely lower margin business. And yet the core business continues to grow, I'd say in a very solid way and is taking share, so that offset.","E. Lee Wyatt","And yes, you can see that into the -- in just the growth of, as we said we could approach 10% operating margin in cabinets this year. We were at 7.3% last year. So it's that mix, as we continue to be disciplined in that mix, and still get good sales growth. You'll see those operating margins come back. And our long-term goal, as we've said, is 14%, which was kind of prerecession levels for our operating margins in cabinets.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one last quick one, if I could. A competitor mentioned last week -- your large other public competitor, that they saw a little bit of increase in commercial activity in cabinets. Did you see that as well during the quarter? And any thoughts around that? Or that perhaps -- was that more temporary in your view? Or any thoughts around that?","Christopher J. Klein","I think in retail, there was a little bit. I don't think it is sticky or at a higher level. We kind of held where we were. And I think that channel on the retail side in general is pretty healthy right now. So didn't really concern us. On the dealer side, didn't see the same thing. So I think the market is obviously despite the quarter we just had with the weather impact. Market overall is pretty healthy on that regard. And we're kind of all off running and bringing better stuff into the market.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So a little more temporary, then, in your view?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, that was our take on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Cabinets. There's more companies out there today than there were several quarters ago commenting on the trends. And if you wouldn't mind, I mean, there's a lot of numbers today. And I appreciate the extra work you guys did there. But could you answer just on like the cabinet side, for example, could you start or comment on your ability to start commenting on volume and price\/mix within that category? So we could understand how revenue is being impacted, if it's largely by price\/mix, or in fact if it's end-market volumes?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure, I'll give you a broader look at it, and then maybe Lee will follow-up with some specifics. But I'd say, in general, it's volume. We are getting improved mix. As the volume is coming through our dealer channel, that does have a higher price point, better mix coming through. So the performance that we saw, especially in this quarter, through that channel, was really quite strong. And so our strength in the channel is being led by that and so that will have volume share gain, as well as mix included in that as it translates into revenue. Lee, I don't know if you want to give...","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. We've always talked about getting back to operating margins of 14%, the prerecession targets and levels. And a big part of that is leveraging cabinets and the R&R growth, because we've said, over a recession-recovery period, you'll always get R&R big ticket that lags in the early stages, and then actually accelerates on a dollar basis beyond normal growth at some point in the market. And it's that kind of acceleration in big ticket R&R that really helps us improve from the 9.3% operating margin that we had last year to getting back to that 14%, when we hit kind of a normal run rate market. And if you take the midpoint of our guidance, you start approaching in '14, 11% operating margin. And a good piece of that is what Chris described, it's the better mix coming through bigger ticket items, so which is very helpful and that's why that dealer base in cabinets is so strong to us.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. If you could maybe, Lee, going -- just sticking with cabinets here. I think in the prior quarter you kind of talked about the contribution that's WoodCrafters, and how it's kind of -- how that was. Would that be something you could update us on? Or it doesn't matter because WoodCrafters is kind of past that [indiscernible]?","E. Lee Wyatt","WoodCrafters -- yes, I would tell you generally about WoodCrafters when we made the acquisition last June, we basically said it was a $230 million revenue company. And in '14 would generate incremental EPS of 11% to 13%. And it's spot on that. We're very pleased with that, those are really good estimates and it's performing well. It is getting harder and harder to break that out, as they now start becoming more integrated and actually providing componentry into the broader cabinet business. So we're going to struggle to have that happen. I would tell you this, if you take, kind of -- if our cabinet business for the full year approaches 10% operating margin, which is what their target is, you'll see incremental margins even with WoodCrafters in there between that 25% and 30%. So we're really not worried about it. It's -- they have very good leverage in that business, especially as R&R comes back and with their great strength in that dealer channel, so it was good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's extremely helpful on this call to see where the weather impacted you. You can't go without a capital allocation question, and what you're seeing on that front with M&A, with your share repurchase and you've talked about your CapEx. But if you all can just elaborate on, one, what you're seeing, how optimistic you feel about it on the M&A? And if it's not going to come through this year, sort of how do you think about your capital allocation from there?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. Yes, I'd start with -- and I hate to sound like a broken record, but we're going to be very efficient with our cash and capital allocation and really leverage it as well. So I'd say, first off on the M&A side, the market is getting busier, so we are seeing more opportunities. I can't predict or project when those things will materialize into something that we end up closing on, but I would just say market feels stronger over the last 90 days than it had as we were in third and fourth quarter last year. So we're just looking at a number of different things. Our teams are busy, and so I think that's encouraging. Expect that to continue. So I think it's the start of what I would expect to be the next couple of years of an increasing pace on there. So as we talk about it, the more opportunities we have to look at and folks to talk to, the more likelihood it is that we'll be able to actually get some things done. So hopeful on that. But that's a good sign that is emerging as we are kind of 4 months into '14. On the dividend side, we obviously increased our dividend late last year and declared that just recently. So we're on that trajectory. And then the share repurchase, Lee can comment for a minute on kind of our activities so far.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, as we've always said, we don't need to accumulate cash. And so as we began planning for 2014, we basically said, let's make sure we avoid any share dilution. So let's use cash early in the year to just systematically buy back shares. So we've -- in the first quarter, spent about $69 million to buy back shares, just to kind of avoid any dilution as we use cash. We'll do that and we'll pay the dividend each quarter, and we'll still, by year end, have net debt-to-EBITDA basically around 0. So we're just using the cash efficiently, and using it where we can. And as M&A develops, then we'll figure that out and we've got a lot of leverage potential on our balance sheet, as Chris said.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. Helpful. And then just 2 odds and ends question. One, on the cabinets side, we've heard different stories on wood inflation and are you seeing it and can you pass it through? And then the other thing, China, you talked about it, it remains strong. They've seen a lot of slowdown there, why do you think -- are you just such, so early in the process that you're just growing through it, or what do you think is driving that?","Christopher J. Klein","I'll talk about China and then Lee can touch on the wood. I was just out there with our team a few weeks ago and I'd say a lot of discussion about where the growth is, or where it's not. Our business is concentrated in Tier 1, Tier 2 markets, and they're performing better than the Tier 3, Tier 4 right now. And so I think that we're well-positioned there. Obviously a broad network of stores, really working with the stores to improve the flow there. Over time, I mean, we've been a heavy new construction market in China. Over time, we're starting to see some R&R activity come through there. I think that will build over time, so we remain optimistic. All that being said, I wouldn't rule out that there is a slower new construction market flowing through China in the next year or 2, it's pretty well documented and we talked a lot about it. But I'd say, I was encouraged that our own performance was pretty good and I think we're being quite prudent in terms of our expansion into the markets that are showing good growth and paying attention to the velocity within those stores and so not getting out ahead of the development in the Tier 3, Tier 4 markets with the absorption out there and might not be kind of keeping up. So that's just our take on it now. The other thing I'd say is, we're going to continue to watch it closely because it is evolving and the situation's [indiscernible] than it was 6 months or 9 months ago.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I got you. What type of store growth are you expecting this year?","Christopher J. Klein","We look at that every quarter. So typically, we might target 50, 70, I think it's 100 stores, but that will depend on where we see the opportunities. If we don't see the opportunities, we'll be more modest in the store growth this year. So I think we'll evaluate it quarter-over-quarter. The other part of our focus is direct-to-builder business, which is growing over there and increasing the velocity within the existing stores. So it's really that mix that we're trying to optimize to get the growth.","E. Lee Wyatt","And, Stephen, on the inflation. The first quarter was very much a repeat of the fourth quarter, where we saw total inflation across the company as in the low single-digit range. We did see wood at the higher wood, plywood, particle board at the higher end kind of the mid-single digits. We do get pricing, we continually get pricing to offset inflation, so we've seen that. So inflation was not an issue, pricing more than offset it. But overall, for the quarter, pretty minimal impact on either when we net them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Looking specifically at April, I know you talked about acceleration. But based on some of your comments, are you still not quite at this 10% kind of run rate we're expecting for the year?","Christopher J. Klein","I'd say we're building towards that. We're not there yet. So January, February was hard, negative, down. March started to improve. I'd say April improved a little bit better than March, but still not kind of up to that ramp. The activity that we're seeing more recently, as we look into activity in orders that we expect and then are going to convert into revenue in May are picking up. So I view the second quarter very much as a kind of the on ramp into the second half of the year. So I'm encouraged by the activity we're seeing. I think there's real strength. It's pretty widespread. It's both in the recovery in the Midwest, Northeast. There continues to be good activity around the whole country. So -- but it's just pacing. It's just -- basically, I think getting the consumer back that into the flow in those parts of the market where they were quiet for the first part of the year.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second question on the cabinet acquisition last year, it looks like that may have added about $30 million of revenue. Is that number roughly correct?","E. Lee Wyatt","It's -- for the quarter, a little higher than that. It was a $230 million revenue estimate. So probably closer to $50 million in the quarter.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","$50 million in the quarter, okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","I just have a question. You talked about the potential sales and margins by segment. Just wondering if we should think about that in relation to your guidance. Is this a framework by segment that should take us towards the midpoint of the guidance? Is this the best case scenario? I'm just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color around the language.","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. What we tried to do in the first quarter, whenever you -- when we have weather that really confuses the performance. So we try to add the weather back so you could see it. But then we still try to give you just a sense. Not as much guidance by segment, but just kind of the potential and some of the things we're working towards. But I think if you would look at those generally and say it's probably moving towards the midpoint of the guidance.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And just a follow-up is, a competitor had indicated they're seeing some extended lead times between new housing starts and when their products are signed to be shipped in, whether it's a bigger mix of multifamily construction or whether it's supply constraints. Are you seeing any evidence on your end that, as housing, if and when it does come back, there might be delays in timing from when a start occurs and when your products actually get shipped?","Christopher J. Klein","No, we don't really see that. I think, on the -- if you go across our portfolio, with cabinets, you're kind of shipping when they're ready for that. And I don't see that changing in the sequencing of how they're building the home. And so we're producing to be delivered into when they're ready for that install. Within faucets, the inventory is flowing into wholesale and the wholesalers are holding that inventory and shipping it in and the builders [ph] are installing when they need it. And on entry doors, we're shipping out into the market. Our distributors are holding and they're assembling to be installed on-site. So I haven't seen any of that impacting our businesses at this point, as I'm sitting here. I, certainly, through the last couple of quarters haven't seen that change.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about in the cabinet business how the home centers grew or what you saw in terms of growth rate in home centers relative to what you saw in dealers.","Christopher J. Klein","I'd say it's different. Dealer market certainly in the non-snow belt regions were very strong. I mean very strong kind of in the over 30% growth type very strong. So and so we certainly didn't see that kind of volume flowing through or that kind of activity flowing through the home centers. In the areas where the weather was impacting, we were down in dealer. And I'd say it's probably more consistent with what we're seeing coming out of the home centers. So that's where the big change was. As we're sitting here in April coming into May, I'd say dealer activity is translating into orders and there's a good pace on that side of the business. In the home centers, there's a lot of activity and we're working closely with them, but there's probably not as fast a conversion from a lot of the quotes that we're seeing and all the work that we're doing and it's kind of again ramping up toward firmer orders. So there's a pace issue is what we're seeing. And so I'm encouraged that there is consumers in -- out there shopping and that we're helping and working them through quotes. But the conversion then from the quote to the order is just kind of -- isn't coming up to pace yet of where the dealers are. So that's the biggest difference I'd say right now.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And then in terms of the builder-direct business, the $50 million, I think you quantified the impact of walking away from that in the quarter. In terms of when you will offset that with other share gains or basically re-purposing that capacity. I just want to make sure I understood, when will that happen? Or when will those 2 -- when will that loss be zeroed out? Is that a 2014 event, first half, second half? How should we think about that?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, it's $50 million -- roughly $50 million for the year 2014 and we exited right at the beginning of the year. We gave notice in the fourth quarter. So it will take all year. But it'll just -- it will flow through. It was $10 million in the quarter, the first quarter, and $50 million for the year. So it'll just flow through the year. I think we have such a good position and a good service proposition in that dealer channel that we're gaining share there. So it'll offset it. And it will be much more profitable.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","So the gross impact of the $50 million have a net offset with the success of your strength in the dealer channel, how much of that will be offset is what I'm trying to figure out?","E. Lee Wyatt","You know hard to tell. I'd tell you, the profit impact will be minimized. The sales you could still get a little slippage, but by the end of the year, I think we'll make that up with the way we're gaining share in the dealer channel. So by the end of the year, I wouldn't think it's going to be an issue. But we will see that each quarter that we're walking away from roughly 1\/4 of $50 million.","Operator","And this concludes our Q&A session for today.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed ample time to address questions that you may have. I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our team delivered strong results at the high-end of our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. We achieved strong sales growth, as the home products market accelerated in the back half of the year, as we had expected. Our teams also delivered strong profit growth driven by efficiency gains in our recently expanded capacity and our continued focus on profitable growth in all channels.","Our strong 2015 results again illustrate that our substantial and leading share positions in each of our categories generate outside sales and earnings growth when our underlying markets are positive. Our leading positions and the momentum we have built position us well for continued strong performance heading into 2016 and beyond.","Let me first take you through some of the fourth quarter highlights and my thoughts on our full year performance in 2015. Then I will discuss our view of the U.S. home products market and our 2016 outlook for topline growth. So let me start with my perspective on our business performance. For the fourth quarter, sales increased 18% in total and 22% for the U.S. businesses. Importantly, total company operating margin increased to 200 basis points to 12% with solid performance across all operating segments.","Starting with our cabinet segment, we continue to follow a disciplined strategy for cabinets, focused on profitable growth and that strategy is working well. We are focused on the most attractive segments of the market where we have our strongest structural competitive advantages and the greatest profit potential. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners is driving growth.","In the fourth quarter, our overall cabinet sales were up 33% over the prior-year quarter with broad growth across all channels. Sales in the U.S. increased 38% including Norcraft acquisition. U.S. sales for dealer and in-stock cabinets and vanities, which account for more than 70% of our annual sales, increased 42%, up 12% excluding Norcraft acquisition. Specifically, sales in our largest channel dealers grew 57% and benefited from the Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains in this key channel are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers, as well as ramping up recently added dealerships.","Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanity sales increased strong double-digits, due largely to strong sell-through of new programs and product upgrades that launched earlier in the year. The remaining 25% of our cabinets business focuses on home center semi-custom, builder direct in select markets and our Canadian sales.","We're disciplined in our approach to these segments of the cabinet market, as we focus on where we can partner with our customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach, combined sales for these segments increased strong double-digits in the quarter, excluding the impact of currency.","Overall for cabinets, our team has continued to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our plants are increasingly more efficient and we're pleased that we added capacity when we did to handle the growth that is now being realized. On the front end of the business, we're performing particularly well and as we build share in the most attractive segments of the market. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins.","For our plumbing segment, sales were up 7% in the quarter and increased 10% excluding the negative impact of currency. Growth was led by U.S. wholesale and retail, as well as China. Again, in the fourth quarter, our mix was solid and margins were strong, both wholesale and retail sales increased high single-digits, driven by new product performance and strong POS.","We're encouraged to see consumers trade up and continued to select our innovative new faucet and shower products for their new homes and repair and remodel projects, including new pull-down faucets with Reflex self-retraction in our Kendall and Glenshire lines and our Magnetix easy docking, easy releasing shower heads. And we will continue our pace of innovation in the coming quarters, as we introduce new products, which include additional pull-down and pull-up faucets with our new Power Clean technology that provides 50% more spray nozzle power and additional styles with our MotionSense hands-free technology.","Sales in Canada were down high single-digits to the prior year, but were up high single-digits in local currency as a gain share. China sales increased both double-digits versus the prior year, driven primarily by our retail stores and e-commerce. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential, and are encouraged by the R&R activity that we are seeing, despite general economic concerns.","Doors reported sales were up 5% for the quarter, but increased 7%, when you exclude the final quarterly impact of exiting some lower margin business in 2015. Door products saw sales growth driven by gains in both new construction and retail. Mix continue to improve with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and premium upgrades, like our recently launched Classic-Craft doors in the American style and Rustic collections that capitalize on the growing trend toward taller doors and wider openings. The Therma-Tru brand continues to perform strongly across all channels and we are benefiting from our expanded distribution.","In the security segment, sales increased 3% from the prior-year quarter and were up 6% excluding the negative impact of currency. High single-digit increases in Master Lock U.S. retail and new program wins for SentrySafe drove the growth. We're excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years. And the integration of Sentry into Master Lock is on track.","So to recap the quarter, we executed well in our U.S. home products market that is improving as we expected. Results were strong and on plan. Our teams are executing well and delivering profitable growth. Before I turn to our outlook for 2016, let me spend sometime on our overall full year 2015 performance.","The U.S. home products market saw steady growth in repair and remodel activity of around 5% throughout 2015 with growth for new construction accelerating to low double-digits in the back half of the year. This was right in line with our initial planning assumption. As a result of this market performance and our execution, we delivered sales growth across the businesses that was on plan for 2015 with sales increasing 14%, despite the negative impact of currency. The sales growth was significant with sales for our U.S. home products business increasing 20%.","We also delivered operating margin that improved a 110 basis points to 11.8% and EPS growth of 19%. Profit improvement was broad across the businesses. We completed our key capacity additions in cabinets and generated significantly better manufacturing efficiency in the back half of the year. We also added capacity in our door segment and began some modest capacity additions in our plumbing assembly operations.","During the year, we also took a number of steps to position ourselves for the growth opportunities that we expect over the coming years. First, in May we purchased Norcraft cabinetry, which is helping us build on our structural competitive advantages with their proven capabilities, and positions us even more strongly for growth and share gains in the critical dealer channel. Norcraft has great relationships in the dealer channel and strong operating management throughout their business. The integration is very straightforward and remains right on track.","Second, in June, we took advantage of the opportunity to secure long-term financing by issuing $900 million in corporate bonds. This provides us significant financial flexibility to drive incremental growth. Last in July, we began integrating the SentrySafe operations into our existing Master Lock platform. As I mentioned, we're excited about the opportunities we see between these two businesses and the teams are working hard to integrate the operations by the middle of 2016.","Moving forward, we continue to focus on creating meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and I'm encouraged by the number of things we're looking at and the potential we have to create incremental shareholder value overtime. Over the next three years, we believe we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive this incremental value.","So in 2015, we delivered solid sales and profit growth driven by reasonable market growth and our strong execution. Importantly, as we enter 2016, our current assessment of the newer and medium-term market based on the demand indicators that we monitor point to overall market growth rates similar to 2015, and we see no challenges to our strong execution, therefore we are well-positioned to deliver similar growth in 2016.","Now, let me turn to our full year outlook for 2016 starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. Our 2016 annual outlook is built on an assumption that U.S. home products market, which impacts over 70% of our sales, grows at a 6% to 7% rate, which is similar to full year 2015 market growth. Within that overall assumption the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at a continued 5% rate. Consumers continue to demonstrate appetite for stronger styling, product differentiation and project complexity. We see the impact of these trends in the improving mix across our categories.","New home construction is assumed to grow at around 10% in 2016, a rate similar to full year 2015 growth. Single-family growth is now expected to grow faster than multi-family, as single-family entry-level activity is beginning to accelerate. Therefore, our top global market, which includes assumptions for U.S. market, as well as our other international and security market is expected to grow at a combined 5% to 6% in 2016.","Based on [technical difficulty] global market assumption, continued share gains, plus the Norcraft acquisition, we expect solid topline growth for 2016, with our full year sales increasing 10% to 12% over 2015, and our home products businesses again outperforming the market for our products. With this market sales growth, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS in the range of $2.42 to $2.52.","So overall, our 2016 outlook is based on reasonable market growth assumptions, based on the basket of market indicators that we monitor. We continue to see steady mix improvement, our capacity is increasingly more efficient, and we feel good about the winning momentum that our teams are carrying into the year.","To sum up, we delivered strong sales and profit growth in 2015 and we are well-positioned to deliver similar growth in 2016. We remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the home products market and our businesses are even stronger. Our strong brands, management team and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our guidance.","Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our fourth quarter results, which were on plan. Sales were $1.22 billion, up 18% from a year ago. As Chris mentioned, sales increased 22% for our U.S. businesses.","Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $147 million, up 42% or $43 million compared to the same quarter last year. Consolidated operating margin improved to 12%. EPS were $0.56 for the quarter versus $0.44 for the same quarter last year, increasing 27% and were at the high-end of our guidance range.","Now, let me provide more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $608 million, up $152 million or 33% versus the prior-year quarter. Norcraft added $107 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $309 million and increased 57% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanity sales of $121 million increased 15%, driven by strong sell-through of new products. The remaining sales for home center, semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 21%, excluding the negative impact of currency of approximately $8 million.","Operating income for the cabinet segment increased 72% or $26 million over the prior-year quarter, with Norcraft adding half of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points to 10%. For the full year, cabinet sales increased 22% over the prior year and operating income grew 42% to $196 million, with the operating margin increasing 130 basis points to 9%. Excluding the Norcraft acquisition and the negative impact of currency, sales increased 8% and operating income grew 19%.","Turning to plumbing. Sales for the fourth quarter were $359 million, up $23 million or 7%, led by U.S. retail, U.S wholesale and China. Excluding the $9 million negative impact of currency, total plumbing sales increased 10%. Canadian sales increased 8%, and China sales increased 14%.","Operating income increased $12 million to $71 million, up 21%. Operating margin for this segment was 19.8%, up 220 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The negative impact of currency was $6 million. For the full year, plumbing sales increased 6%, operating income was up 12% over the prior year and operating margin increased to 120 basis points to 20.7%.","Door sales were $115 million, up $5 million or 5% from the prior-year quarter. Sales were up 7% excluding the impact of exiting some low margin business. Operating income increased $6 million to $13 million, up 77%. Operating margin was 11.6% for the quarter. For the full year, Door sales increased 6%, operating income grew 51% and operating margin increased 290 basis points to 10%.","Security sales were $144 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% to the prior year. The U.S. business was up 7%. The impact of foreign currency reduced sales by $3 million in the quarter. Segment operating income increased to $19 million, up 21% and the segment operating margin was 13%. For the full year, security sales increase to 15%, operating income increased 17% from the prior year and operating margin was 12.5%. We expect significant operating margin improvement in 2017, after we complete the integration of the SentrySafe manufacturing into our Master Lock platform in 2016.","To sum up, consolidated fourth quarter performance, sales increased 18% and EPS were on plan at $0.56. Our total company operating margin was 12%, with an incremental margin of 44%, excluding acquisitions. For the full year 2015, sales increased 14% and EPS grew 19% to $2.07, which was at the high-end of our outlook. Total company operating margin was 11.8%, a 110 basis point improvement. We are on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state levels.","Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total fourth quarter sales by approximately $20 million, with Canada being the primary source the EPS impact was approximately $0.02. For the full year, currency movements reduced sales by $69 million and EPS by $0.07.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our December 31 balance sheet remained solid, with cash of $239 million, debt of $1.2 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.4x. We had nothing drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility. Since the beginning of 2016, we have repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares totaling $100 million.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Based on our projected 6% to 7% U.S. home product market growth and our total global market growth of 5% to 6%, as well as our continued share gains and additional sales from the Norcraft acquisition, we expect full year 2016 sales to increase 10% to 12% compared to 2015.","Our resulting outlook for 2016 EPS are in the range of $2.42 to $2.52. The midpoint of our EPS outlook reflects an increase of 19%, similar growth to 2015, with the first quarter EPS growth rate similar to what we expect for the full year 2016.","The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $45 million, a tax rate 33%, average fully diluted shares of approximately $163 million, a positive impact from commodity cost that will partially offset a negative impact from currency in the first half of 2016, and a double-digit increase in healthcare cost. We expect 2016 free cash flow to be $350 million to $375 million with conversion rate of over 90%.","In summary, the fourth quarter and full year EPS were on plan with market growth as expected. The solid performance of our business for the year, the recent investments made to increase capacity, and the expected continued market recovery give us confidence in continued solid growth in the coming years. Importantly, the 110 basis point operating margin increase in 2015 and expected 100 basis point increase at the midpoint of our 2016 outlook, place us right on track for achieving our three year operating margin targets.","Also, as demonstrated by the Norcraft acquisition, share repurchases and the dividend rate increase, we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value, additionally on your debt structure provide significant flexibility to continue to drive incremental shareholder value.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks on the fourth quarter of 2015 and our full year 2016 outlook. We will now begin taking at a limited number of question. Since there maybe a number of you who would like to ask a question, I will ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Bob Wetenhall","Chris, Lee, and Brian, congratulations on a very strong finish to the year and the encouraging guide for 2016. Chris, I just wanted to start with you. Thanks for the detailed guidance and your underlying assumptions for end markets in 2016. I was hoping you could give us a bit more granularity and share some color on what you're using to drive your outlook, and what are you seeing in demand trends as we start the year that gives you confidence in the growth rates you outlined for growth in the home products market, domestically and internationally?","Christopher Klein","We really look at a lot of different factors to drive our outlook. And to actually break it down a bit, on the supply side, we're looking at a lot of the fundamentals land sales, land development, permits, starts, homes under construction, supply of inventory, labor availability, and then kind of look at supply versus demand, the fundamentals around household formation, affordability, home prices, interest rates, levels of consumer debt. And then we look at builder reported new home sale order rates and new and existing home sales and purchase finance applications and then look at the macro levels stuff around consumer confidence, employment rates.","So we take all of that plus more and actually try to drive toward what we think are the fundamentals around the outlook for new construction, existing housing turnover, R&R. Then we compare to the stuff that we're actually seeing from our customers and the discussions that we're having.","So keep in mind, we're a leader in our category, so we've got a pretty broad network of customers we're getting input from. But we're listening to builders, home centers, plumbing wholesalers, 5,200 kitchen and bath dealers, we're looking at order patterns. We're looking at prior quarter patterns. We're looking at current quarter patterns. And we roll that all together, and then we compare it to what consensus is in the market and what others are saying. So I'd say we've got a lot more proprietary.","Last year, we came out, and I'd say, almost hit it dead on with where we wound up. So our estimate of housing starts overall between single-family and multi-family, it was a 1.119 million. And I guess, the year wound up at 1.107 million. Consensus was at 1.2 million, so we were off by 11,000 and the market was off by 100,000. So I'm not gloating here, I'm just saying we've got much better at looking at the drivers at a very granular kind of-data driven level, and then comparing it to what we're hearing and seeing in the market.","And the second part of your question was around what we're seeing right now. And actually, the year's off pretty good, off to a pretty good start. So both order patterns, and then January, which is done now are on plan, maybe a little bit stronger, but we're seeing actually really encouraging signs. And that matches up well to, we were out to builder and kitchen and bath show two weeks ago, and lot of positive commentary.","And as we look at the current behavior in the builders, with order patterns, and what we're hearing from home centers, so I would say, we built all this over the fourth quarter and what we're seeing over the first six weeks of the year support our outlook and where we think the year is trending and where the year will come in.","Bob Wetenhall","Well, that's a nice start to the year. That's obviously encouraging. And thank you for all the detail there. I wanted to switch gears and ask Lee about your assumptions on operating margin performance in your guidance. And I know that Fortune invested in cabinets' capacity two years ago. Last year, you spent money investing in Plumbing and Doors. I wanted to understand better how the absence of cost moving into '16 might benefit margin expansion. And maybe if you could just give us a flavor for how much operating leverage is in the business, based on the assumptions that Chris outlined for volume growth?","Lee Wyatt","So as we think about operating margin growth, it starts with our long-term strategy. And we said at the spin that our focus was when we get steady-state, which is 1.4 million to 1.5 million housing starts a year, which is not peak, but which we consider steady-state, we'd be back to 14% to 15% operating margins, which was similar to what we had pre-downturn.","And we think we've continued to do that each year, the growth of 110 basis points of operating margin in '15 and then at the midpoint of our guidance, were another 100 basis points improvement to maybe 12.8%. So we're right on track if you assume. Over the next three years, we hit steady-state. But what's really driving that, I think it starts with the focus on disciplined sales growth that drives profit, not just driving sales growth for the sake of sales, but really targeting across all of our segments that we're going to just really drive disciplined profit growth.","I think secondly, what you've seen in '15 is with those lack of or the reduction in investments that we've had in '14 and even early part of '15, we're getting very good leverage across our business. For the full year, our incremental margin on incremental sales was about 36%, we will normally plan around 25% to 30% on an annual basis, but we're getting to starting to see that real leverage comes when you reduce investments, and so that's driving a lot of this margin expansion.","I think the other thing you're seeing is the operating efficiencies are improving since we're not increasing the capacity at this point and we watch that closely. Our product mix continues to improve across our channels and across our segments. So I think that combination you're seeing not only for the fourth quarter, but for the full year. And it's reflected in our guidance that that's the discipline that's going to continue drive this operating margin growth.","Bob Wetenhall","Could you just give us an idea based on your topline guide, what kind of incremental margin we should be thinking about that ties in with your EPS guide?","Lee Wyatt","So for the midpoint of our '16 guidance, we've got an incremental margin. We've got somewhere $300 million to $400 million in sales increases with 25% to 28% incremental margin on that sales growth. So continued within the range that we planned for and we manage around, so 25%, 26%, 27%, somewhere in that range of incremental margins in our guidance for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird.","Tim Wojs","I guess, just first question on the cabinets business. Just curious, how you're thinking about the margins in that business from maybe both in absolute level in 2016 and an incremental level? And then also in plumbing, how should we think of just the pace of margin improvement in that business just given how 20% has kind of been your kind of long-term view on where margin stack out there?","Lee Wyatt","Yes, so for cabinets operating margin, you look at 2015 for the full year was 9%, that's up a 130 basis points. If you kind of take midpoint of our guidance for '16, I think you could see approaching an 11% operating margin, which would put them anywhere around that would put them on that three year trajectory to get back to the 14%-plus operating margin, which is our target for them. So again, they're making nice progress. We put capacity in '14, a little bit in early '15, so now you're starting to see the leverage against that. And that should continue to get them on track for that 14%-plus at kind of steady state.","Moen, last year in '14 was 19.5%, this year in 2015 they were 20.7%. We kind of think that our strategy there is that's a fine margin, it could go up. But the real strategy there is to drive sales above market growth sales at anywhere close to that margin. So we're very happy with the 20%-plus operating margin. We can retain that. But our real goal is to drive incremental value by really driving sales around that same margin rate would be a better way to create value then just increasing that margin year-over-year.","Tim Wojs","And then just on the quarterly guidance, I just want to make sure I heard you right. I think you said Q1 growth EPS growth should be similar to the full year?","Lee Wyatt","Yes. So EPS midpoint of the guidance $2.47, that's 19% over 2015 full year, and we're basically saying first quarter should grow about the same pace.","Tim Wojs","Weren't there some inefficiencies in the cabinets business last year that you guys lapped?","Lee Wyatt","There were. There was about $5 million to $6 million in the first quarter of some inefficiencies that we'll get back. But we've also got some other things happening in the first quarter. We're continuing in the first quarter, remember that's a low leverage quarter, because it's the lowest revenue, but we add period costs that will probably cost us $0.03 or $0.04 in the first quarter versus last year.","We're making a last piece of investment in Moen, which is probably other $0.01 interest expense, because we did our refinancing in the summer of '15 will cost us about $0.03 or $8 million in the first quarter versus last year and we got some medical going up and some other things. So yes, there are few tailwinds, but there is some other things that are going to pull back down to make that kind of that similar 18% to 20% growth rate reasonable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse.","Mike Dahl","Just to follow up on the question around cadence. On a higher level, just obviously this past year, you had forecast acceleration through the year, and ultimately, you were able to achieve that. I think if we look at some things like in aggregate builder order growth has decelerated a bit, existing home sale growth has decelerated a bit in the fourth quarter. Just wondering, if you could outline what the general cadence from a topline perspective is as you walk through the year? Is it evenly weighted? How would you characterize that?","Christopher Klein","Yes, it's evenly weighted. I think if you look at our business, we lack the construction cycle by quarter or two and that was extended out, second half of last year the average length of completing a home extended out. So our products were going in later. So we're still benefiting from activity in the second half of last year that will come in, in the first part of this year.","And then actually the starts activity, enough order activity should support our overall guidance for the whole year. So we see there's a pretty steady cadence throughout quarter-over-quarter for our products coming in, because there is that kind of lag built into the system. So it should be a little bit more even than it was last year, where we're started out slow, and then ramped up second half. We don't see that happening. We see there's more of a kind of even quarter-over-quarter.","Mike Dahl","And as a point of clarification, and then I have a separate follow-up, but Chris, I think you mentioned 10% as a planning assumption for starts, but that single-family is starting to outpace multi-family. So what is your single-family assumption within the guide?","Christopher Klein","Low teens single-family and mid-single multi-family. So we're predicting that those two spread a bit. And on the margin that helps us, a little bit more square footage single-family homes benefits us, more faucets, more cabinets.","Mike Dahl","And then Lee, another more detailed guidance question. When you get into a little bit of some of the other line items or other things impacting the P&L this year, and noted commodity costs are partially offsetting FX and healthcare, could you give us any more granularity around to kind of the net impact or breaking down the net impacts, so how much are you benefiting from commodity and how much is it weighted towards plumbing versus seeing some in doors or cabinets, and then how much of an FX headwind are you assuming?","Lee Wyatt","So when you start with, for example, FX, so for the full year of 2015 FX reduced our sales by around $69 million, $70 million and that was about $0.07 of EPS. For 2016 around the midpoint of the guidance, we're saying FX could reduce our sales in the 50 to 75 basis point range, and probably about $0.02 negative impact. And the largest portion of that is in the first half of 2016 around commodities.","I think we said it, on our third quarter call that the third quarter '15 was about $3 million dollar benefit. We saw the fourth quarter around that same, maybe $4 million. Our assumption in our guidance, so that's at $7 million for the second half and the first half was kind of breakeven to be honest with you. A little bit of cost in the first quarter of '15, little benefit in the second quarter, but those kind of washed.","I'd say our plans for '16 midpoint guidance -- in the first half of '16, $7 million to $8 million benefit, very similar to the second half and then kind of slowing down in the second half of '16, so some of that benefit going away. So I'd say, the first half of '16 from a commodity benefit is should be very similar to the second half of '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc.","Ken Zener","Lee, Chris, you guys obviously delivered well in '15, despite the accelerating growth, as you guys described it in the back half, which is similar to the cadence you expect have outlined in '16. I think existing home sales were up, let's say, 5%, 6% last year. And the NAR is kind of talking more in that low single-digit range this year. I realize you guys have a dashboard where you really look at a lot of things.","I wonder if you could just be specific to the things that there's a lag between turn over historically and building product activity demand. What is it that gives you the confidence that despite that headline slowdown according to the NAR, and I'd be interested in your number, obviously prices have gone up, equity's built up, but what gives you confidence to hold that same rate despite the slower turnover, if you will?","Lee Wyatt","So the turnover rate has been kind of running low-to-mid single in existing housing. We're encouraged by the credit availability, especially at the entry-level. I think that the bigger constraint has been the inventory of existing housing that's been in the market than there is demand. I think if you look at Case Schiller and other pricing surveys, the pressure that you see on existing housing price is rising is because there's inventory is not quite where demand is. So I'm encouraged by demand and I'm encouraged by credit availability.","I also look at, from just a macro standpoint, level of spending per household on home improvements. We're not even back to a 50-year average yet. We've been running below that since 2008, so we look at that and how far up are we on that curve. It's a large number universe, so you're talking about the average is like 725 to 750, but if you actually look at those who are really remodeling, it's in the 1,500 north of that type number.","Then you look at what the home centers activity has been and that's going to run in mid-singe digits. And I think their outlooks are more from mid-single digits for the year, so there's a number of factors that get us pretty comfortable around a 5% rate, which is really the historic average. I think there is potential for upside over that over the next couple of years, just based on the fact that we've underinvested the repair\/remodel side of the market. Houses are getting older. We've under built relative to the housing stock over eight years and so you're just kind of continuing to lean on the existing housing stock.","So the turnover is one factor that used to highly correlated, so back I'm talking pre-2006, that's highly correlated to R&R spending. That completely disconnected in the downturn. It's gotten tighter, but it isn't kind of back to that same high level of correlation. So it's important, but it's not the only driver in R&R that we look at.","Ken Zener","My follow-up question will be, I guess, along the same lines, if you will. You're talking credit availability HELOCs, for example, when you talk especially in the very important dealer channel, I mean what insights do you get from them as opposed to perhaps financial data talking about where those people are getting the money for these higher ticket projects? I mean how do you quantify that in a way that we can't see necessarily?","Christopher Klein","It skews by household type. So older households are drawing from savings, and they have been for a while. They're not really relying on credit as much. And for a long time, we saw that in the mix coming through dealers, as being a richer mix. And when they were spending, they were actually spending not constrained by credit.","Over the last 18, 24 months, we've seen much more activity at kind of the entry-level semi-custom level, both in home centers as well as in the dealer channel. We think there probably is some credit support to that. And that's, you could say its HELOCs, you could say its refinancing, it's general savings. And the price points are frankly lower, so they can afford -- they're more affordable projects at that kind of entry-level semi-custom, so you're not needing to really finance that much of a purchase. So I think it's a combination of those two, depending on the level of activity we're seeing.","Anecdotally, across the dealer channel, pretty consistent growth throughout the year, so about 10% in the quarter 10% for the whole year. And we saw actually a mix shift a little bit more to some of that semi-custom, out of the custom. So there is kind of more of that support in the general broader market, but pretty consistent growth rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor from Zelman & Associates.","Scott Rednor","What are the planning assumptions for Canada and China? And maybe you could talk about specifically how you guys are generating pretty impressive growth there, given what we see as kind of macro headwinds in both of those regions?","Christopher Klein","Our planning assumption is pretty modest, in general, across Canada, China, a 2% growth, so low single-digits type growth. Where we're seeing success in China is really retail an e-commerce. And so the Moen brand, we've been there 20 years, we're very well recognized. And so just as e-commerce continues to expand across categories in China, we're benefiting from that. And so that's driving some pretty good growth from us at good margins. And our traditional retail, where we've got 1,000 outlets in China is supporting our R&R activity that's coming through that market.","There is some softness in direct to builder, but frankly it's just down low single-digits, so it's less than you might expect. It might be at that faucets and sinks are fairly small ticket purchase, remodeling type ticket purchase is holding up reasonably well. But we've obviously pressure tested it as we come into the year.","And so we're looking closely at it, but so far we're seeing reasonable rates for our category, not relying upon new construction, but really more of the retail side of that market. Canada relatively flat, I think it depends on part of the country. Obviously, out West, Calgary impacted by oil, but the cities are holding up okay, and I'd just say low single-digits is what we're planning for the year.","Scott Rednor","And then, Chris, where we can draw volume assumptions based on housing starts data, et cetera, but where do you think we are in the mix cycle, either across the portfolio or across your various product categories?","Christopher Klein","Where we're in the mix cycle?","Scott Rednor","Yes. I mean, are we back to mid-cycle or are we approaching peak? Where do you guys think you are in terms of product mix? And how does that stand relative to prior peak or even a downturn?","Christopher Klein","Yes. I think from mix standpoint, we've seen continuing improvement in mix. And I'd step back, we tested that over the summer, and we did some proprietary research, some real consumer research. And this all kind of comes back to the consumer desire to personalize their space. They want something rather complex unique and so that's translating into consumer buying up in our mix change.","So from entry level up to first second upgrades, more semi-custom, more unique finishes, painted versus stained looks, things that we can price for not just raising prices, but rather the mix is driving that. Same on entry doors with Therma-Tru, they're buying more unique glass styles, different finishes in that entry. So I'd say we're not at pick. I'd say, it continues to improve and is driving some of that margin improvement that we see.","So the margin improvements coming from the efficiencies in our plants, it's also coming from some of that mix improvement as they're buying the new products that we're bringing in and mixing and matching for their own unique styles. And that was something that we were sitting there saying, how long is this going to run for, and actually based on our research it's going to continue to run.","I think this is pretty fundamental on consumer behavior in U.S., as people like to customize more and more. And so we're working hard with our designers, our channel partners to provide that mix and provide more unique looks that the consumers are going to get excited about.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","Just a couple of questions here. I guess, first on the margin outlook. I always appreciate the detailed guidance and thought process. I was hoping if you guys can give a little bit on both doors and security margins, how to think about that for 2016? I know you referred to expecting some material margin expansion, I believe in the security business following the integration of SentrySafe. So I don't know if that puts you solidly above a 13% mark or mid-13s? Also, with the door business a lot of improvement there, certainly some driven by the new mix, but from an incremental margin standpoint, we'd love your thoughts there as well?","Lee Wyatt","I'll start with security. So full year '15, operating margin of 12.5%. We are, as Chris mentioned in his comments, we started the integration in end of June of '15 of SentrySafe manufacturing into Master Lock. That will take a year or so, so some times this summer we should finish that. So at point at a minimum by the fourth quarter of '16, we should be at a much higher run rate.","I'd say you could see SentrySafe going pre-integration of the manufacturing from a 7% operating margin to 13%, 14% operating margin for at least the last quarter of '16. And then by the time, we hit '17, if they're at a 13%, 14% Master Lock is a 14% to 15%. So you've taken that whole business up nicely from 12.5% this year to 14% to 15% by '17. But '16 is a transition year. We won't get a lot of the benefit until probably the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit into the third. So great profit growth potential there with that integration.","In terms of doors, so doors nice growth in '15, operating margin full year 10%. Doors are much like cabinets. We expect them to get back to that 14%, 15% operating margin at steady state. They're making great progress there. I think if you looked at the midpoint of our guidance, you could see them approaching or exceeding 11% in '16.","So again, just like cabinets, well on track to get back to that 14%-plus at steady state. So this all goes back to the things, Chris, talked about and that really disciplined approach to sales growth that really drives profit. So these margin improvements are across all of our segments, because it's a philosophy.","Michael Rehaut","And then aside from a modeling question around your outlook for corporate expense, I wanted to get a sense also, I think you mentioned in your guidance, it incorporates a roughly flattish share count. And I would assume, obviously you would also incorporate, you're not modeling in any future bolt-on acquisitions. You've been very good about creating a decent cadence over the last two or three years in terms of these bolt-on opportunities and when those don't present themselves, be willing to buy back some stock.","I was wondering if that type of balance, let's say, would also be applicable to 2016, where I presume you're still, as of the last conference call, very active on the M&A side, but if that doesn't necessarily happen, given the strong free cash flow and good balance sheet position, that you'd still be willing to repurchase some shares throughout the year, so thoughts around that, and again, the first, minor modeling on the corporate expense for the year?","Christopher Klein","We remain, as we have, focused on total shareholder value and so we are very active right now on the M&A side. We've got a lot of discussions going on, are in the midst of a number of things, and I can never predict if any of these will result. But I'm encouraged by our level of activity. If anything we're busier now than we were a year ago, and so I'd say that still is a real focus for us.","On the other side, we bought back $100 million worth of our shares, 2.1 million in the month of January. I would say at the value that we're seeing in the market right now versus our plans, we'll remain looking hard at share repurchase this year. We still got about $148 million left under our authorization. So we're going to look at both of those, and we've got plenty of capacity to both buyback shares and complete acquisitions.","We ended year at only 1.4x debt. So we've got capacity to do things. We've got debt capacity. We've got strong free cash flow. So we'll be very efficient with our cash. We have been coming up on five years here and we're going to continue to do that and there maybe some really nice opportunities looking at us over the next few months. So that's about all I can say on all that, but I'd say, we'll be balanced in our approach across those two.","Michael Rehaut","And that 2.1 million, the $163 million reflects that 2.1, so I guess there's some options and natural share creep, and then again, just the corporate expense, so your thoughts for the year?","Lee Wyatt","The $163 million that we ended the year is what we modeled in guidance. The guidance, that includes the need to buyback about 1 million shares just to avoid dilution. So we bought back 2.1 in January, 1 million of that's built into the guidance, 1 million of it isn't.","In terms of corporate, and we break corporate out into kind of the G&A and then our net pension income. That will go up from $63 million in 2015 to we think maybe $69 million in '16 kind of guidance and $3 million of it is just less pension income, $2 million of it is spending on cyber security and the other $1 million is miscellaneous. So I'd plan on the net of $69 million.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back over to Brian Lantz for closing remarks.","End of Q&A","Brian Lantz","Thank you.

We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress during the fourth quarter of 2014 and provide our 2015 guidance. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release issued earlier.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams delivered solid growth in the fourth quarter in the face of tough comps. For the full year, we posted meaningful growth in a market that ran below our original planning assumptions.","We continue to gain share, our mix continues to improve, and our core businesses are performing well. In 2014, we also took actions to refine our portfolio and invested in capacity and capabilities to prepare for additional growth, as we expect our markets to continue to improve in 2015 and beyond.","Let me first take you through some of the fourth quarter highlights. Then, I will briefly discuss some of the steps we are taking to reposition our portfolio for additional growth. And last, I will discuss our 2015 outlook for top line growth.","For the quarter, sales were up 8% and EPS was $0.44, up 38% from a year ago. This performance is particularly strong given the challenging comparison to the prior year quarter when sales increased 20% for our home segments.","Let me give you some highlights by segment. Sales for our cabinets business were even with the prior year quarter. Excluding the exit of the builder direct business in the west, the builder and dealer channels grew double-digits, while Canada increased 9% due to the exchange rate movements.","We again gained share in the dealer channel where we continued to see growth across all price points and a better mix as new products and finishes are selling well. Our share gains are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers as well as new dealerships. In 2014, we had 300 new dealer relationships, all of which have now begun to order.","Our new product launches, including the new Omega frameless custom line for dealers, continuing to sell well and are driving share gains. Our refreshed Diamond line is performing well above expectations and new finishes in our Aristokraft, Homecrest and Kitchen Craft lines are also selling well.","Despite challenging third and fourth quarter comparisons to product line review winds in the prior year, WoodCrafters\u2019 performance has been solid. From a revenue perspective, bath vanity products are selling well.","With the multi-year integration on track, WoodCrafters is also beginning to help our core cabinet business by producing lower-cost componentry for our existing cabinet lines with this low-cost North American manufacturing capacity.","Overall, for cabinets, our team has continued to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our structural competitive advantages have been built over a long period of time and are tough to replicate. The impact of this consistent execution can be seen in our share gains across channels, our stronger mix and our improving margins.","Plumbing reported sales that were up 6% for the quarter led by growth in U.S. wholesale and retail, as well as in China. In the fourth quarter of 2014, our sales grew, mix was solid, and margins were strong. Our performance was led by our U.S. plumbing business, which grew high single digits across wholesale and retail. Importantly, wholesalers began ordering to POS, ending several quarters of inventory reduction, as channel inventories exited the year at healthy levels.","We\u2019re encouraged to see consumers continue to select our innovative new faucet products for their new homes and repair and remodel projects, including new pull-out and pull-down faucets with reflex self-retraction in our Brookshire, Hensley, and Etch lines, our Align modern suite, and our Oxby bath accessories and faucets. Overall, we see continued see strength in the more premium end of the market supporting bigger remodel and renovation projects.","International sales increased low single digits, with double-digit growth in China, largely offset by weakness in Canada, which was negatively impacted by a stronger dollar. China sales grew low double-digit over the prior year, a clear improvement in momentum over the previous two quarters.","Our nearly 1,000 Moen stores generated solid growth as we continue to focus our marketing efforts at the local city level. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential.","Doors reported sales were up 12% for the quarter. Door products again saw healthy sales growth, driven by gains in new construction and benefits from our distribution additions. We continue to see growth from our expansion in the Western region that we put in place over the last couple of years.","Mix also improved, especially with consumers more frequently choosing our decorative glass designs and responding to our new styles like our recently launched Pulse line of modern entry doors. The furniture brand continues to perform strongly across all channels.","In the security segment, sales increased 48% from the prior year quarter. Sales from the SentrySafe acquisition added significantly to the growth. The teams are working hard to integrate the operation and we\u2019re excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years. Master Lock security sales increased 5%, with U.S. retail and U.S safety growing double-digits. So to sum up the quarter, our results were as expected. Our teams executed well, we continue to gain share and we enter 2015 with good momentum.","I\u2019d now like to turn to a number of delivered actions that we took in 2014 to enhance our ability to deliver stronger, long-term growth. And 2014 unfolded, it became clear to us that the market for U.S. home products was likely to grow below our original assumptions. We decided to accelerate some actions to make the most of this softer market backdrop to better position ourselves for the growth opportunity that we expect over the coming years.","First, given our positive long-term view of the U.S. housing market, along with our structural competitive advantages and our continued strong execution, we capitalized on the opportunity to repurchase $440 million of our shares as the markets softened midyear.","We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. We feel that the share repurchases in 2014 were a very efficient and timely use of cash.","Second, we accelerated certain investments into 2014 for capacity and capabilities, which will allow us to maximize growth from our market share gains as the home products market gradually returns to steady state.","Given our leading share positions in our categories, even modest market growth drives strong demand and requires available capacity to ensure that we can service the business well. These 2014 investments were primarily in our cabinet segment, where we continue to experience new product successes and take share. The cabinet investments are now mostly behind us and our 2015 investments will focus on our plumbing, doors, and security businesses.","Third, we sold the Simonton windows business, which was sub-scaled within our portfolio. With the third quarter sale of that business, we are better positioned to focus on driving profitable growth for our ThermaTru door business, as you can now see more clearly in our results.","Fourth, we acquired SentrySafe, a market leader in personal safes. I\u2019m excited about the Master Lock and Sentry growth platform that we have created with these two market leaders in security. Additional opportunities for these more growth oriented brands include driving sales and innovation, leveraging global distribution and generating cost synergies.","Also, the integration of Sentry with our Master Lock business and the separation of the tool storage business triggered a global workforce reduction of 9% in Security business in the fourth quarter. Last, we moved the tool storage business out of Master Lock into a stand-alone discontinued operation and are reviewing long-term strategic alternatives given the challenges this business has seen over the past few years.","We are currently focused on organizing the business as a self sufficient stand-alone entity with a single domestic manufacturing location and more focused in efficiency. Our tool storage business does not have the same growth profile as our security business. It is the leader within the category. We feel there is a future for this business within the category and are evaluating various strategic alternatives.","So, in 2014 while we gained share and delivered solid growth, we also took deliberate actions to enhance the growth profile of our business. I\u2019m excited that we took advantage of the slower market by investing in capacity to support long-term demand, eliminating lower growth businesses from our portfolio and accelerating opportunities in the personal security segment. Given our strong positions in our markets and our now stronger growth profile, improvements in market demand should provide us even greater opportunity.","Now, let me turn to our full-year outlook for 2015, starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. While 2014 market growth slowed and it was lower than we expected, the home products market has experienced three years of solid growth. We are now seeing signs of accelerating strength across many aspects of the market and believe that 2015 will be stronger than 2014. Importantly, we believe that the market is entering a new period of multi-year growth.","Our 2015 annual outlook is built upon an assumption that the U.S. home products market, which impact 70% of our sales grows at a combined 6% to 8% rate. Within that overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at a 4% to 5% rate. New home construction, where our products are installed in the later stages of the building cycle, has seen the pace pick up somewhat and is assumed to grow low teens over 2014.","Based on that U.S. home products market projection, the assumptions we make for our other markets, continued share gains plus the SentrySafe acquisition, we expect solid top line growth for 2015, with our full year sales increasing 9% to 11% over 2014 and our home products business is, again, outperforming the market for our products.","Additionally, given that our products are later stage in new construction and the spring new model season is yet to kick off, we expect that this growth will skew much more to the second, third and fourth quarters. With this market and sales growth, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS for $2 to $2.10.","So to sum up, we remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the recovery in home products market. We\u2019re gaining share. Our core businesses are strong and because of actions we took in 2014, we\u2019re well positioned to deliver solid growth in 2015 and beyond as the housing market continues its recovery. We also continue to believe that our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value and very strong free cash flow.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our 2015 outlook.","Lee Wyatt","Thanks Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Also, tool storage results are now reflected as a discontinued operation and are therefore excluded from continuing operations for all periods. As a result, our previous full-year guidance range of $1.84 to $1.86 should be adjusted to a range of $1.73 to $1.75 for a better comparison of performance. As Brian mentioned, quarterly results for 2013 and 2014 on a continuing operations basis are now posted on our website.","Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.04 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $104 million, up 25% or $21 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.44 for the quarter versus $0.32 the same quarter last year, an increase of 38%.","Now, let me provide more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $456 million, flat to the prior year quarter, which had a 34% increase. Excluding the impact of the planned exit of the builder west business, that was $13 million last year. Builder channel sales increased 10%. Dealer channel sales also increased 10% in the quarter as we continue to gain share, while Canadian sales declined 9% compared to last year due to the exchange rate moments.","While operating income for the cabinet segment increased 6% over the prior year quarter with an improved operating margin of 7.8%, it\u2019s was depressed approximately $12 million by inefficiencies related to implementing capacity expansion actions that were then magnified by demand surges in certain product lines such as Diamond [indiscernible] and Aristokraft. While these actions impacted profit in the second half of 2014 and may linger into the first quarter of 2015, they should improve long-term returns beginning in the second quarter.","For the full year, cabinet sales increased 9% over the prior year and operating profit grew 15% to $138 million and operating margin was 7.7% reflecting the previously discussed operating inefficiencies and $53 million lower sales from exiting the builder west business.","Turning to Plumbing, sales for the fourth quarter were $335 million, up $18 million or 6%, led by the U.S. wholesale and retail channels and 10% growth in China. Operating income increased $5 million to $59 million, up 10%. Operating margin for this segment was 17.6%, lower than previous quarters due to shifting expanses from prior quarters. For the full year, plumbing sales increased 3%. Operating profit was up 13% to the prior year and operating margin increased 170 basis points to 19.5%.","Door sales were $109 million, up $12 million or 12% from the prior year quarter. Operating income for this segment was $8 million, a $4 million improvement from the fourth quarter last year. Operating margin for the segment increased to 6.9%. For the full year, door sales increased 11%, operating profit doubled from the prior year and operating margin increased 300 basis points to 7.1%.","Security sales, which now include SentrySafe were $139 million in the fourth quarter, up 48% to the prior year quarter. Master Lock sales increased 5% with a 14.3% operating margin. Segment operating income was $15 million and operating margin for this segment was 11.1%. For the full year, security sales increased 20%. Operating profit increased 7% from the prior year and operating margin was 12.3%. Master Lock\u2019s operating margin was 13.6%.","As Chris mentioned, we\u2019re focused on integrating SentrySafe into our Master Lock security business to create a stronger growth platform. We moved tool storage to discontinued operations, while it is reorganized into a stand-alone business and we explore strategic alternatives.","Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the impact of exchange rates. The strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our EPS by $0.05 in 2014. Our Canadian businesses with over $400 million in sales were negatively impacted by $0.04 and our China business by $0.01. The overall impact in the fourth quarter was $0.02.","Turning to the balance sheet, our December 31 balance sheet remains solid, with cash of $192 million, debt of $670 million and our net debt to EBITDA leverage is 0.9 times. We have $145 million draws on our $975 million revolving credit facility. Our balance sheet reflects the impact of full year capital expenditure of $128 million.","Share repurchases of $440 million and the acquisition in SentrySafe. The remaining unutilized share repurchase authorization is approximately $300 million. Given our cash flow and balance sheet profile, share repurchases should not limit any expected M&A activity as we continue to actively pursue accretive acquisitions.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2015, as Chris mentioned, based on our projected 6% to 8% U.S. home products market growth, the assumptions we make for other markets, and continued share gains, plus the SentrySafe acquisition, we expect full year 2015 sales to increase 9% to 11% compared to 2014. We expect lower growth in the first quarter with improvement throughout the balance of 2015.","Our resulting outlook for 2015 EPS are in the range of $2 to $2.10. The first quarter should experience lower EPS growth with improving growth throughout the balance of 2015. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions. Interest expense of $15 million, tax rate of 32.5%, a negative FX impact of $0.02 to $0.03, an average fully diluted shares of approximately 162 million. We expect 2015 free cash flow to be around $250 million after expected CapEx of $130 million. This should be the last year that capital expenditures significantly exceed depreciation and amortization.","In summary, while 2014 has been a year of change for our business, we\u2019re positive about the future. The solid performance of our core business, the investments made to increase capacity, the steps taken to reposition our portfolio for stronger growth and the expected continuing market recovery give us confidence in continued solid growth in the coming years.","Importantly, we remain focused on using our strong balance sheet and cash flow to make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. We\u2019re well positioned as we focus on maximizing shareholder value.","I\u2019ll now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the full year 2015 guidance. We will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. Since there maybe a number of you that would like to ask a question, I will ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill for Zelman and Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis McGill","Hello, guys. Thank you.","Chris Klein","Hi, Dennis.","Dennis McGill","My first question just has to do with as we think about the guidance in 2015 and particularly on the cost side. If I\u2019m running the right, it seems like the incremental implied is something around 20% on a core basis. And you just did something much stronger than that in the fourth quarter even with some of the one-time hits you\u2019re not noted in cabinets and some system [ph] plumbing, so can you maybe bridge what's impacting that and how we should think about that as we move through the year?","Chris Klein","Yeah, when you look at 2015, if you look at it on an operating segment basis, each of the operating companies in the home space are around 24%, 25% incremental margins. And even Master Lock piece in the security side is around 25%. SentrySafe is the one thing, because we\u2019re still integrating, we still have some acquisition items going through there is the thing that takes us down.","So if you look at Fortune and then the other pieces where we are adding some corporate cost that we had taken out in 2014. So if you look at operating leverage on incremental sales, a pure calculation of FBHS is about 19%. If you add back the SentrySafe impact, you get to 22%. And if you take the $8 million to $9 million that we are putting back in corporate that we took out, you get to about 25%. So we feel good about the leverage given that we are adding some cost into the business and the operating companies in 2015, but we are still getting around 25% incremental margin.","And on the operating margin line, we move up about at the midpoint of the guidance around 11.5% this year, compared to 10.7% in 2014. So we think - we are still investing, we\u2019ve got some upfront cost going in. We feel pretty good about the overall leverage. And then as you move into 2016 and 2017, we\u2019ve got those costs in and we will leverage them even more in 2016, 2017, 2018.","Dennis McGill","So along those lines, the leverage didn\u2019t go above what you would consider to be normal in 2016 because you are pulling that forward into 2015?","Chris Klein","I think, it could, yes, and in 2017 as well because when we invest in this capacity then you get a couple of things happening, we won\u2019t invest ahead, we won\u2019t have to invest as much in the future and any of the inefficiencies or destructive cost that we put in now tend to go away.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then when you spoke about the guidance through the year, it was an accelerating phase, but 1Q last year was pretty rough in general from weather and I think you guys went to a lot of lengths to kind of detail out for your business and I would think even though you\u2019ve got some momentum in new construction just building and you\u2019d have that easy comp and kind of the inefficiencies from the weather to comp against, so how do you kind of juggle those two aspects as you look at the first quarter?","Chris Klein","Yeah. We\u2019ll see how it unfolds. I think we saw pretty good momentum exiting the year coming into the first quarter. So far, we\u2019re sitting here, early February, pretty good order patterns, pretty good traffic and yet there is a lag relative to new construction, our products come in later in the cycle. So that\u2019s where we see continuing momentum to build through the year. So second, third, fourth quarter you should see much more momentum than the first quarter.","We certainly would have some benefits relative to a tough year last year, but we\u2019re not kind of calling out that it\u2019s going to be that much higher. So I just expect that we\u2019re going build it over the year. I think more broadly what we\u2019re looking at is we brought in capacity, we invested in 2014 to position the business really for the next three year and that is our focus is on that longer-term horizon.","And I think we kind of look at 2015 as the on ramp to another phase of three-year growth and so we\u2019re just saying first quarter, first half relative to second half, it\u2019s going to get stronger as the year unfolds and it\u2019s going to get stronger in 2016 and that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve kind of positioned the business and put the cost structure into the business.","Dennis McGill","Okay, appreciate it. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Market. Your line of open.","Bob Wetenhall","Hey, thanks for taking the question. Hey, Chris, you were pretty busy last year selling and buying some stuff. What\u2019s your assessment of the condition of the portfolio and what are you thinking about from the M&A front as you go into 2015?","Chris Klein","Yeah. So, we were busy last year, I think we took advantage of the year to really position the business and focus on the growth segments and where we saw really accelerating the business. As the market is going to recover over the next three years, we want to really maximize growth and then lever that as things unfolded.","I\u2019d say on the - kind of discontinued side of the business, I don\u2019t look at anything beyond what we\u2019re working on. We just announced that we\u2019re in the process of working on Waterloo, obviously did something with Simonton, so I think the portfolio in the segments that we've got, look at from that standpoint, and we're looking at a number of different acquisition opportunities in the segments.","And I\u2019d say, there is things that we\u2019re looking at plumbing, there is things we could look at cabinets, in the door and exterior segment. And then with Master Lock, they\u2019re busy integrating Sentry. It doesn\u2019t mean we are not looking at stuff, but they\u2019re working pretty hard on that. So we\u2019re going to make sure that we get that fully integrated, put to bed, if something comes along we\u2019ll take a look at it.","I\u2019d say in general, the pace looks good. I\u2019d say it\u2019s been steady really since kind of second quarter last year, so it continues to move through, we have stuff coming at us and we are looking at everything and I can never predict we will be successful, but I\u2019d like to make sure that we are busy and looking at things and I\u2019d say that we are and I expect we will do some things in 2015.","Bob Wetenhall","Cool. That\u2019s very helpful. Lee, if you could kind of breakout your top line guidance. That was some terrific detail you gave. I think you\u2019re talking about revenue growth of 9% to 11%, what\u2019s the split there between organic that you already have and kind of SentrySafe coming in, how should we be thinking about that? Thanks very much and good luck.","Lee Wyatt","We see SentrySafe probably in the $150 million sales range next year, that\u2019s coming off of - less than half of that this year as we acquired it just in the second half of the year. So feel like we\u2019ll get some growth there. I think the rest of it is pretty much organic growth at this point. So if you take the midpoint of 9% to 11%, sales growth or 15% and call it, 10%, we probably get two points of growth out of SentrySafe and then everything else is organic.","Bob Wetenhall","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Group. Your line is open.","Mike Wood","Hi, thanks. Can you give some more detail on the corporate costs, the $19 million that you said you are adding back and also what happens with the $0.11 that you had called out earlier about the 2014 investments, whether or not they go away and how input costs contribute? Thank you.","Lee Wyatt","Sure. So corporate, really the increase is $8 million to $9 million versus 14%. You only have to look at our corporate cost over the last three year since the spin. So in 2013, total corporate cost was $68 million. In 2014, we spent very little, matter of fact, we took it down to $56 million as we were focused more on kind of this internal restructuring and candidly we didn\u2019t hit our plan in 2014, so we didn\u2019t pay out a target bonus, so that took it down some in 2014 as well.","So we went from $68 million in 2013 to $56 million in 2014. We\u2019re talking a back up $8 million to $9 million that gets us back to around $65 million, still lower than the 2013 level, but a few things in there. If you get a couple of million more cost in taking the bonus target back up to 100% of target, there is little more depreciation. So there is not a lot of headcount ads. We don\u2019t have a big corporate group here, so a little over a100 people.","Chris Klein","Yeah, little over a 100 people in corporate for a business that employees almost 20,000 people, so we\u2019re pretty lean and I\u2019d say as Lee is describing it, last year we had very little in the way of external support for development activities and those sorts of things. So we\u2019re just assuming that we\u2019ll return to a more normal pace as we were in prior periods.","Mike Wood","Thank you. And is the most likely use of the proceeds - if you end up selling the Waterloo business for M&A or would it be invested in share buybacks?","Chris Klein","Some combination of both. I think we were committed to being efficient with our cash and so we look at acquisitions as they come available or as we\u2019re able to generate them and we\u2019ve got plenty of flexibility there in terms of balance sheet and then we are looking for opportunities to buyback shares and we will steadily increase the dividends. I\u2019d say it\u2019s not specifically earmarked for anything, I\u2019d say we will be efficient with the proceeds and make sure that we create a lot of value. So that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been doing for the last three and half years and we\u2019re going to keep doing it.","Mike Wood","Okay, thanks.","Lee Wyatt","You had also have asked about investments. So from an EPS perspective as we described earlier in the year and last quarter, we\u2019ll spend about $0.12 on investments in 2014 from an EPS perspective. We kind of think in 2015 that will go down to about $0.08, we\u2019ll shift from more investments in cabinets in 2014 more to Moen and some indoors in 2015. But we\u2019ll pick up about $0.04 tailwind there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow on the Waterloo side of things, I guess, if you could walk us through your decision process on that, I think you had an 8-K out towards the end of the year, talking about the restructuring to enhance the profitability and now just over a month later discontinuing the operations. So I guess what became so obvious that even with the restructuring, the profitability or the profile was such that, it no longer belonged as part of the portfolio?","Chris Klein","Yeah, I\u2019d really say it\u2019s been a long road, kind of a multi-year effort as the key, because customer in that segment has been in decline, big retailer and so we\u2019re making these [indiscernible] and are the leader in that category. I think we\u2019ve done a lot to restructure over the years.","As we looked at it in the fall, we said okay, we\u2019re going to take one more bigger step toward restructuring and started consolidating around one domestic facility, looking that product line and making sure that we were generating best returns out of that product line. I think it became apparent that the growth prospects were rough even as the market leaders that it wasn\u2019t going to have the same profiles as what we have in the rest of the business.","So that really caused us to say let\u2019s look at other alternatives for the business. We think it\u2019s viable but it\u2019s a business that could belong in the right hands or it doesn\u2019t fit in terms of growth profile with the balance of our businesses. So that\u2019s really a process we work through from our restructuring to a kind of longer-term.","Is this going to have a growth profile consistent with the rest of our business? As we look at the rest of our businesses, we\u2019re heading into kind of a multi-year growth phase, a very healthy high-growth share gaining business. We really wanted to focus on that and within specifically that storage security segment bringing SentrySafe in and integrating it into Master Lock.","That creates really a forward looking growth segment. And we can focus on home security and the devices that are locks that are safes and moving more toward electronic and investing. We see some pretty good strong growth profile there and increasingly that tool storage business didn\u2019t fit that profit. So that was the thought process that went into it. There is growing concerns, we\u2019re not liquidating the business, and we\u2019ll look at what\u2019s the best thing to do with that to generate the most shareholder value.","Michael Dahl","Okay, thanks. And shifting gears to the M&A side. I appreciate the color you gave earlier. It seems like there was a change in personnel on the business development side. How should we interpret that as we think about the M&A pipeline, was it just a difference in strategic vision or was it just a lack of opportunities coming to fruition? Any color you could provide there would be helpful.","Chris Klein","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t link it directly to that. I\u2019d just say, overtime we\u2019ll look to kind of put the best folks in place. We\u2019ve pretty high standards. We have a very strong management team here and so we\u2019re just looking to put the right people in place. The person that was in that role did a terrific job of building up capabilities. There is a strong team there that remains and they continue to go through.","I was increasingly spending more and more on that and I will continue to spend more time on that and overtime, we\u2019ll put somebody else in that role. So I wouldn\u2019t directly link that to a change if you will in our outlook, it\u2019s more of a broader philosophy around making sure we got the best people in the right roles and they are all aligned on what we\u2019re trying to do going forward.","So we\u2019re busy. I mean, on the M&A side we got lot of activity going on and our team spending time there and I\u2019m involved in all those discussions. So I\u2019d say there is no transition in terms of the pace that we\u2019re operating at and we\u2019re going to continue to roll.","Michael Dahl","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Ken Zener","Afternoon, gentlemen.","Chris Klein","Hi.","Ken Zener","Your growth forecast, if you could perhaps give us a little more flavor for perhaps front half, back half given the comps that you guys were talking about and perhaps by magnitude of business as there is different, obviously, growth rates that we\u2019re seeing on an organic basis within doors, cabinets et cetera.","Chris Klein","Sure. I\u2019ll give you kind of a broader look and then Lee will give you in a more deal, but I\u2019d say more broadly, we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the next three years and I\u2019ll just start with that. We think the market is setting up to have a very strong three year growth profile. Given our leadership positions in each of these segments, our share positions in cabinets and in faucets and entry doors, we\u2019re going to benefit from that growth even if it\u2019s relatively modest we see a lot of volume coming at us are share gains. And so I\u2019d say, that\u2019s the setup. 2015 is kind of a ramp up over the next three years and that\u2019s kind of how we thought about it. We lag a quarter or two on the new construction cycle, so as you start to see activity coming in 2015, we\u2019ll lag a little bit and then we\u2019re going to kind of hit the stride coming through. So that was really the way of thinking about pacing it. If we weren\u2019t talking about a single year, we\u2019re talking about three years, we\u2019d say, that\u2019s just kind of consistent trajectory going from 2015 into 2016 and 2017.","By business, we\u2019re forecasting pretty strong year for the three segments that you\u2019ve mentioned. I think within cabinets, we\u2019re seeing some very, very good growth in the dealer side of the market, some pretty impressive gains we\u2019ve made. We added over 300 dealerships in 2014 and we went deeper in a lot of our existing relationships. Home centers will continue to just drive new product, strong service.","And in the builder side of the market, out of the markets that we exited, we\u2019re seeing good growth there. So MBCI is setting up for a very good 2015 into 2016. Moen continues to perform well both in the wholesale and retail side. And there, as we see new construction, Moen is really going see some strong leverage.","And on the doors, you can finally see the strength of the door business. I get a lot of questions on doors when we were selling Simonton why are you keeping doors. Well, now we have two quarters and everybody can see what I\u2019ve been looking out for a long time, which is some great top line growth there and some pretty strong leverage. They\u2019ve got a lot of expansion especially in the South, Southwest, West, where a lot of construction activity is going on. So that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the results that we see. Lee, I don\u2019t know if you want to give a little more detail?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah, let me just talk about segments a little bit more, starting with total FBHS, 8.4% sales in 2014 full year, 9% to 11% is our guidance for 2015, so nice improvement there. I think when you look at the segments, cabinet business grew 9% sales in 2014, but a good piece of that was the WoodCrafters in the first half - was incremental in the first half of 2014. So you could see MBCI growing at that same rate in 2015, but it\u2019s all organic at this point, so that could be strong.","So Moen grew about 3.4% in 2014, I think - and a big piece of that was the wholesalers for the first three quarters were taking down inventory, which impacted sales and the first quarter was a little challenging from a weather perspective. I think you could see that increase significantly to kind of high single-digit range. Doors grew 11.4%. That\u2019s a big number. If they do that again, that would be good, but they had nice potential. So I think you could see our home business growing nicely and primarily organically versus little less organic in 2014. So that\u2019s very positive.","I think you can see the Master Lock piece excluding SentrySafe grew 3% in 2014. I think you could see it doing a little bit better than that in 2015 and that\u2019s more of a GDP business and we are getting incremental volume in SentrySafe, because we will have a full year now in 2015 of them, so we feel pretty good about the volume growth here. And a significant portion of it is organic, so that\u2019s good.","Ken Zener","Thank you for that clarification.","Lee Wyatt","I think this is when Chris talks about we\u2019ve repositioned our portfolio for higher growth, I think that\u2019s what you see here with the kind of repositioning he\u2019s done.","Ken Zener","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve East with Evercore. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi, guys. This is Truman Patterson on for Stephen East. How are you doing?","Chris Klein","Good.","Truman Patterson","Thanks for the color on the individual segment growth. I guess as you are looking out into 2015 into your sales and EPS outlook, which segment would you say that you have the most confidence in performing going forward either on a revenue growth or an operating margin perspective? Could you go into some of the dynamics? Why is it kind of end-market related? Or management specific action that\u2019s driving it? And then on the flipside, for my follow-up, just which segment - identical question, but which segment do you have the least confidence in?","Chris Klein","I\u2019d say, kind of across the board, as Lee highlighted, I feel good about all our segments. I think, there is different dynamics going on inside of each, I think. In our cabinet segment, we continue to just execute kind of incrementally quarter to quarter and gaining share and that momentum keeps rolling and frankly we are setup really well in the market right now and a lot of things are going really well. A lot of it\u2019s the basics. I mean, they are really focused on executing everyday lot of service. I feel good about the consistency of it because it\u2019s across so many fronts and I think that they\u2019ve got great momentum coming into the year.","With Moen, it comes back to kind of on the wholesale side, we\u2019ve got strong relationships with big builders and those are multi-year relationships and good share, especially the top 50, top 75, so there it is tied to new construction on the wholesale side and if you see some decent growth and we are looking at kind of maybe low teens in new construction, Moen will perform. I mean it\u2019s - they are locked in there. So we just need some volume to come through that side of the market.","And in retail, we\u2019ve got a lot of good placements coming in this year. So I feel good about that and it\u2019s pretty consistent business. ThermaTru, I think that is - that too is consistent around growth because of their expansion and distribution and we\u2019ve brought new product in. We\u2019ve also focused on home center in a new line up there and we saw some of that strength come through especially second half of the year. And with Master Lock, I think it\u2019s a lower growth business, but it is pretty consistent as it rolls through. So I would say I feel good about each of them in different ways.","I\u2019d say from an operating standpoint, certainly we had a lot of change coming through MBCI on the cabinet side of the business as we put in some additional capacity really to handle the volume that we see coming at us. And if we keep gaining share like this, I frankly worry more about do we have the capacity there. And so we did a lot of that in 2014 to set ourselves up for the next three years and I feel good about it now.","We worked through a lot of pains in getting that in place. We will have a little bit of carry-over may be in the first quarter there and then they are going to be on their way. And I feel great that we took advantage of 2014 to get that in place and it sets up a multi-year expansion there and we can handle the business that we are winning, and that\u2019s pretty important or we won\u2019t be able to handle it.","Moen, I think we\u2019ve been adding incremental capacity there and we will continue to add things there. Those are in smaller chunks that we set that up. And then, doors, too, I mean we may add some incremental presses to handle the volume that we see coming at us, so execution, I don\u2019t see that big of a deal.","Master Lock\/Sentry, there is a lot of heavy lifting there to put the businesses together and the teams are working on it. And as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s going to be 2015 going into 2016 effort. It\u2019s on track. But we think there\u2019s a lot of upside. We brought that business pretty good price and that was with the understanding that there was upside there as we integrate the businesses. There was cost to take out and leverage there, and then it sets up a growth platform and we can continue to acquire especially on the electronic side of the business, now we\u2019ve got platforms on the lock side, on safe side, clean technology is going in there. But there is a lot of work to do in 2015 on the Sentry\/Master Lock side to get that set up for the next couple of years.","So we got great management in place. These guys are really working hard and sure there is lot to do this year, but we feel pretty good about it. I mean, I think we are sitting in a pretty good spot, we need the market to come as we suggested it, it would this year and next year and we should be executing at a high level.","Truman Patterson","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois","Hi, thank you. You provided incremental margin guidance by segment, thanks for that. But I was just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that in the context of potentially lower input costs with hardwood leveling off and the decline in energy related and diesel related costs, is that going to be a potential tailwind for you at all?","Lee Wyatt","We\u2019ve seen in terms of commodity inflation this year and 2014, seen it kind of low single digits, pretty consistent through the year. Diesel has started coming off obviously later in the fourth quarter. That should be a tailwind for us into 2015. The other side, we don\u2019t really know about yet is the FX side, because FX cost us $0.05 in 2014, and in 2015, in this guidance, we\u2019ve got about $0.02.","So I think we could get - on the diesel could get us $0.03 or $0.04 depending on when it starts coming back and the prices start coming back up. $0.03 or $0.04 there. And then, FX could be a little bit of a risk that could offset a piece of that. So we\u2019re working hard to make sure we get those reduced logistics cost and diesel cost, but you have to really work hard to get those out there and come out by themselves. So we\u2019re doing that and it should be some tailwind.","Garik Shmois","Okay, thanks. And then, I\u2019m not sure if I missed it, but the $0.08 in incremental investments for 2015, did you break out how that looks by segment?","Lee Wyatt","What we said was $0.12 and EPS was the incremental investment in 2014 and the majority of that was cabinets as we accelerated the investments there. In 2015, it\u2019s going to going down to $0.08 EPS with Moen be the bigger piece and then there is a little bit of a door investment as well, but cabinets will be much lower in 2015, Moen will be higher but net-net, it will be down about $0.04.","Garik Shmois","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Hi guys, good afternoon.","Chris Klein","Hello","Tim Wojs","I\u2019m just curious in the dealer channel with in the cabinets business, did you see any sort of change or improvement just call it activity traffic, anything just in Q4 maybe and into Q1, any color around that would be helpful?","Chris Klein","I think we saw a pretty good traffic in the second half of the year and then it always quiets down a little bit around the holidays and so we\u2019re just now in the start of the season and we\u2019re reporting that there is good traffic in the showrooms. The designers are working. The orders are starting to come in, but it will really pick up here as we enter into mid and late February and March, that\u2019s kind of where we really start to see that traffic. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s good but there is no reason for us not to kind of believe what we had in terms of assumption coming into the year, but it\u2019s early, it\u2019s just kind of we are just starting to get ramped up on it. So I\u2019d say, no surprises.","Tim Wojs","Okay. And then Lee, on the FX impact, I think you said $0.02 to $0.03 to EPS. I\u2019m just curious, in the 9% to 11% sales growth forecast, what\u2019s baked in there for FX for 2015?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah. It\u2019s not significant on - it\u2019s probably 50 basis points of sales negative or probably even less than 50 basis points of sales negative in 2015. It was about a 70 basis point hit on FX in 2014 sales.","Tim Wojs","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. Just going back to raw materials for a second, a couple of questions on that, how much are you assuming in terms any relief in the guidance and specifically, have you seen any relief in recent weeks on hardwood inputs?","Chris Klein","We have seen some. Middle of the year we were seeing kind of mid single-digits inflation in hardwood and molded wood and some particle board. We\u2019ve kind of seen that soften, some now. It\u2019s more in low single-digits now. So it has reduced some, but it\u2019s still probably the highest piece of inflation we have in our business, but it has come down some.","Keith Hughes","And I guess one final question. This should be the last quarter where the cabinet business that you walked away from the West Coast will affect the numbers. Can you give us a rough idea how much that hurt in dollars in the quarter?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah. In the fourth quarter of 2014, it was $13 million. For the full year, it was $53 million and it\u2019s over now. Thank goodness.","Keith Hughes","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much. I had a couple. My first question, there were two things I heard regarding sales growth that puzzled me a little bit. I was wondering if you could help me out. The first thing is you mentioned that partly and due to the fact that you had somewhat growth this year, you accelerated your plans for investment in cabinets for example and I was puzzled. Wouldn\u2019t you be more like to accelerate those investments in a situation where your sales growth you were experiencing was higher than you expected rather like than lower?","And the second question relates to your guidance on sales growth next year. I think you indicated that are looking 9% to 11%, but that it was going to be more heavily weighted to 2Q, 3Q and 4Q, but in 1Q you had pretty impact from weather, I think that you had expressed that in terms of - I think I had $0.08 or something like that or $40 million of sales headwind last year and so it would just seem like you would be seeing much greater sales growth in 1Q rather than 2Q, 3Q and4Q. So I was curious if you could help me out with two issues?","Chris Klein","Sure. I guess on the first question, it\u2019s helpful to look at the business and the way we run the business is over a multi-year period, not quarter-to-quarter and so the businesses that we\u2019re in especially cabinet business is a very complex process to manufacture, service and ship the product.","And so as you lookout over a multi-year period and we do this on a quarterly basis, we say, okay, what kind of share gains are we getting, what kind of market are we assuming and you got to make investments well ahead, 12 months, 18 months ahead of when you expect you\u2019re going to need that demand to be operating at an efficient level. And that\u2019s been true about the cabinet business for as long as I can remember. And I think our competitors have the same phenomenon rolling through.","So it\u2019s not a business that you can kind of flip on or flip off. And so as we looked at this year, while growth was slower than we expected, we looked out over the next three years and said we are gaining share in our main channels to an extraordinary extend. With a little bit of kind of market growth on top of those share gains, going by product line, we are going to run out of capacity in 2015 and so we put those investments in place in 2014 to set that up.","The comment I made was referring to the fact that if we had been having to generate and manufacture as much product as we thought we were going to have to in 2014, it would have been harder to accelerate that. So when we looked at our capacity expansion plans, starting the year - at the start of 2014, it was a multi-year effort because that\u2019s all you could handle given the flow of product going through the plants.","And so we said, okay, hey, it\u2019s a little slower than we thought it was going to be - we can pull some of that 2015 activity into 2014, get it out of the way and now we set up a strong three year trajectory for us to be able to handle the business going forward. So I guess in summary it\u2019s about multi-year expansions versus quarterly expansions and you can\u2019t kind of flip a switch to say, well, we\u2019re going to expand the size of the cabinet plant.","To a lesser extent that\u2019s true in faucets and doors as well is that to add capacity there is a multi-quarter effort and so you got to look out pass through quarter to say what am I going to need over the next year or two and then you bring that capacity in or out. It was the same way in the downturn. When we restructured, we moved faster than anybody else in the market, it was multi-year effort to take the costs out to base the business down when we took revenue down from $4.6 billion to $3 billion. Second question, Lee, you can\u2026","Lee Wyatt","We did have a weather impact in the first quarter of 2014, no question. I think when we started putting our plan together and we looked at the market growth and we look at how the market increases hit us, there is always a lag and it\u2019s a quarter or so. So if you think about an example of in the middle of 2013 when the mortgage rate started going up, new construction started slowing down.","We still had a very strong second half of 2013. So there is a lag impact and so what we\u2019re seeing here is we think the market is improving in 2015. We feel very comfortable about the long-term market, we feel comfortable that it will get better in 2015. It\u2019s the pacing, at this point, we\u2019re not certain about so when we did the market growth and then our growth related and our share gains related to that, it just felt like this is going to be slower in the first quarter until the momentum starts building.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. You line is open.","Will Loh","Hi, it\u2019s actually Will Loh on for Mike. I was wondering if you can talk about the cadence of the investment spend which you say will be about $0.08 and primarily in - and plumbing will be primarily - I don\u2019t know if they will be primarily first half weighted or back half weighted and I guess just longer term as well post the investment spend, you guys did about 19.5% operating margin in plumbing this year. Is that something that you think is sustainable longer-term?","Lee Wyatt","So the investment spending of, we think about $0.08 majority being Moen will start in the first quarter actually. It has to do with capacity in our North Carolina assembly facility and actually the bigger piece is actually in our China facility for example where we need more size because Moen continues to growth and take share. So we think it\u2019s going to kind of start, we want to get it behind us and we want to start as early as possible, so starting in the first quarter.","The other question is Moen margin","Will Loh","Yeah.","Lee Wyatt","Yeah, it\u2019s interesting, Moen ended the year at 19.5% operating margins and they continue to take share. They added 170 basis points this year. Moen is a really strong brand, we have structural advantages that are just really strong and we closed multi-year contracts with the big builder. So with Moen, the issue around operating margin is then how high can you get it? 19.5% is pretty strong, the question with Moen is how much volume can you drive through with those same kind of margins and that\u2019s what Chris and the team think about a lot. That\u2019s a big focus of our long-term planning analysis and strategy over the next three year. So we don\u2019t need to drive it higher than 19% or even 20%, we just need to find out how to drive more sales through it at that rate.","Will Loh","Great and then just last question. Can you remind us what percentage China is right now of Moen and also what margin profile is there, so it\u2019s above or below company average - line average?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah, Moen China is about $160 million revenue in 2014. We\u2019re approaching a 1,000 stores there. Its operating margin is lower than Moen, but we are continuing to invest, we\u2019re growing stores, we are doing things. 19.5% operating margin is pretty strong, pretty strong margin for anybody to be measured against. So we\u2019re happy with the China margins. They are improving even though we continue to invest. So we like China, we like the potential there.","Will Loh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Presenters, I will now turn the call back over to you.","Brian Lantz","Okay, thank you. This is Brian. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for attending our quarterly call today and we look forward to spending more time with you in the future.

Following their prepared remarks, we've allowed some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. In the fourth quarter our sales growth in the overall market slowed. Despite the market, we made clear progress in our Cabinets business and saw continued strong results in Plumbing and Doors.","In general, however, consumers and channel partners adopted a more cautious stance at year-end and did not order at a typical rate period heading into the New Year. Concerns over trade wars, interest rates in the housing market itself had a clear impact on demand. While we did not factor in the magnitude of the second half housing market pause earlier in the year, we now understand the key drivers and expect that the tax through the system over the next six-month and project a modest increase and second half growth. I will have more to say on the market and our outlook in a moment.","In 2018, our teams executed at a high level during a volatile year. Sales grew 4% and our operating margin was 12.8%. While these results were below our initial expectations, we made significant strides across the company to address market and industry challenges and consciously increased our exposure to a more stable and predictable segments of our markets.","These actions reduced our fixed costs, significantly reduced our exposure to a potential 25% tariff and set us up for improved financial results and growth in 2019 and beyond. We'll give more detail on these actions directly from the division presidents and our operations leader at our Investor event in Boston next Wednesday.","On top of the changes we made inside of our businesses, we also delivered incremental growth during the year as we spent $470 million on the Fiberon Composite Decking acquisition. Repurchased $695 million of our shares and again increased our quarterly dividend by 10%.","All in all, our teams have continued to execute well against our strategy. We remain confident in our ability to outperform in a market that continues to show signs of strong underlying long-term demand based on the number of newly forming households, aging housing stock and underlying consumer confidence.","Importantly, our product and brand positions remain strong and the changes we have made and the businesses we have acquired set us up well for continued growth in 2019 and beyond.","Let me first take you through our fourth quarter results \u2013 on our full year performance in more detail. Then I'll discuss our view of the U.S. home products market, our 2019 outlook for sales and EPS growth and our thoughts on capital allocation.","Beginning with the quarter, overall sales increased 3% with continued strength in plumbing and doors products, partially offset by general market softness across categories. Importantly, our Cabinets business saw stability in sales with priority segments performing well and the significant changes we are making in that business began to show tangible results.","Total company operating margin performance was 12.7%, led by a strong result in Plumbing our margins increased 150 basis points. Our two other businesses were more impacted by the flow-through of lower volume and higher commodity and labor costs. Additionally, Doors & Security, had a few non-repeating items in security as we reposition parts of that business which Pat will cover later.","Turning first to the Plumbing segment. Plumbing sales were up 4% in the quarter. This was solid performance against two years of very strong fourth quarter comps and a softer market this year. The growth was driven by high single-digit growth in our core U.S. wholesale business driven by solid POS and some shipment timing favorability from Hurricane Florence in the third quarter.","Broad-based strength internationally in Latin America and China with sales rising double-digits in each region and the successful integration of our latest Plumbing acquisitions. The premium free standing tubs we sell under the Victoria and Albert brand. As we see in China, we view continued category expansion and selling of a room in the path to continued market outperformance in our Global Plumbing Group.","In 2018, the GPG performed exceptionally well in a tough environment and has delivered on our high expectations through its first two and half years. The 22.3% operating margin we delivered in the fourth quarter is a signal that we can maintain our roughly 21% target operating margin and deliver above-market growth even in a slower market with significant input cost pressure.","As we look into 2019, the GPG is bringing a lot of innovations into the market. Some of these is our normal cadence of style and finished refreshment. In addition, we have a wave of adjacent categories products coming through supported by a number of strategic partnerships that we have entered into in the second half of 2018. You'll hear more about these partnerships next week.","I look forward to introducing you to Nick Fink in Boston. He will provide greater detail on how his team has delivered the exceptional results they have posted thus far and his team's plan for the future.","Turning next to the recently formed Doors & Security segment. Sales were up 7% for the quarter. Sales of Door products grew double-digits again as the furniture teams continues to innovate and drive growth even during the time of lower housing stock in the back half of the year. The combination of wholesale growth through innovation and share gains plus the continued success and expansion of our doors and the R&R program at retail which has meaningfully increased our R&R mix within door products offset the market related headwinds. We expect this trend to continue in 2019 as the furniture team maintains its industry-leading ability to manage input costs and realize price.","Sales of Security products were down double-digits in the quarter driven by decline in international sales due to the softness with key European retailers and several non-repeating prior year fourth quarter promotions in our U.S. retail business.","Our non-repeating items caused sales and margins to slip in the quarter. The good news is that we have completed the product upgrade to the more secured ball bearing locking technology for our core padlock lines and the operational and manufacturing challenges of the summer are now behind us.","Prices addressing material inflation in tariffs as we enter 2019 and under the new leadership of Brett Finley, we're implementing some of the sales success drivers in Master Lock that have significantly accelerated furniture results over the past three years. You'll hear more about these initiatives to simplify, focus, and grow the business directly from Brett on Wednesday during our Investor event.","In composite decking, our Fiberon unit added about a point of growth in the quarter with Q4 being the seasonally slowest period for deck sales.","Fiberon was slightly dilutive to EPS given deal costs, some incremental investments, and lack of seasonal leverage during the short time have owned it. The integration is progressing rapidly as -- as we get deeper into the category and as potential overlap of our existing portfolio in distribution, we remain excited about the opportunity to grow in the outdoor living segment of the market.","In our Cabinet segment, sales were flat in the quarter and up 2% excluding strategic business exits. Similar to recent quarters, sales of value products were stronger than the overall market and sales in our in-stock cabinets and vanities and builder direct businesses were both up high single-digits in the quarter.","Sales in our largest channel, dealer grew low single-digits led by the value product lines. Sales were lower in the home center special order and in Canada where the market continues to trend software than what we see in the U.S.","Our Cabinet business is reversing the negative sales trends we saw earlier in the year even after including the headwinds from the exited business. Although the middle of the market remains somewhat sluggish, our margin associated with these products is trending positively as we successfully increased price, reduced our levels of promotion, move forward with two fewer plants, and continue to aggressively migrate our supply chain.","With direct result of the aggressive actions have marginally affected some improvements and tangible sign continue to be in the right track in pivoting the business.","Regarding our Cabinets' pivot, it's clearly parts of the business that are performing very well, particularly, value products where we have over $1 billion in sales annually.","The margin associated with these products continues to be very attractive, despite the low price points since we have access to a large low-cost production platform specifically designed for these products.","It doesn't come with the cost or complexity associated with more custom make to order products. Our unique capabilities in Mexico facilitate this business. As we continue to execute on our pivot actions, we're reopening the path to margin expansion beginning in 2019, even as the share of value products grows within our overall Cabinet mix. For middle of market semicustom cabinets, we continue to undergo a complete transformation that began in second half of 2017 and continue into this year.","In 2018, we closed two facilities, invested in capacity for lower-priced products, migrated our supply base and footprint, and took headcounts and spending reductions across the Board. In 2019, we'll take even more actions to balance the cost structure and at the same time, launch a broader range of value semi-custom products.","So, to sum up Cabinets, sales growth in the quarter improved and had good margins despite inflation and continued tariffs untitled.","As we look forward, we see growth in 2019 for our Cabinets business in the mid-single digits inclusive of the market dynamics we see and repositioning actions associated with our pivot. In addition to improving our financial results, our actions have increased our exposure to areas of more stable and predictable growth within the cabinet industry.","Lastly, as we enter 2019, we are covering inflation with price and supply chain initiatives. Next week you will hear from our Cabinet center, the advantage. We\u2019ll go into greater detail on the industry, the progress in pivot plan, and our 2019 and longer-term outlook for this business.","Turning to our total company performance for the full year. In 2018, we executed well against our strategies and evolve in certain areas. We grew our sales in earnings despite a softer market. We also deployed a significant amount of capital in an opportunistic way and added exposure to the outdoor living market in a way that we believe will create significant value for shareholders moving forward.","Solid performance in the face of a much softer second half housing market, a spike in inflation, tariffs and interest rates, a severe hurricane that shuttered our U.S. plumbing operation and some cabinet plants for several weeks and persistent uncertainty on trade policy.","For the full year 2018, we grew sales by 4%, earnings by 8% and delivered total company operating margin of 12.8%. Importantly inside each business we made significant progress on our strategies to enhance our sustainable competitive advantages and achieve profitable growth.","In Plumbing, we proved our GPG strategy can perform through a volatile and softer demand environment while maintaining a strong operating margins for this segment.","In Doors & Security, our continued share gains with doors gave us a broader platform to build upon. And our 2019 plan now includes investments to accelerate even more growth with the acquisition of Fiberon. We expect solid margin improvement in 2019 as our leadership in new focus and security takes hold and introduce new electronic products particularly in the commercial channel.","And in Cabinets, we stayed disciplined and focused on profitable growth and navigating the promotional environment, continued trade labor constraints, private tariffs and elevated demand for low price points in simpler projects.","With our disciplined and strategic approach, we are committed to accelerating sales and profit despite the challenging market backdrop and some changes in mix and we are focused on leveraging our industry leadership, supply chain and scale.","Now, let me turn to our full year outlook for 2019, starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. Our outlook for 2019 is for modest U.S. home products market growth of 2% to 4% and a slower start to the first half. This industry growth rate is a slower than we were predicting last year and incorporates the consumer interactions to the interest rate environment were just stabilizing, the home price inflation, which is moderating at higher levels and more modest economic growth in the U.S. economy. We are balancing these forces as constraints to underlying fundamental demand, which would otherwise support higher growth rates for housing and home products.","Within that overall assumption, we anticipate the pace of repair and remodel will be more resilient, but will slow somewhat as well to roughly 4% versus 5% in prior years.","Construction is assumed to grow at 2% to 3% in 2019. Single-family is expected to continue to grow a bit faster than multi-family and single-family entry-level activity is expected to remain strong there.","Our total global market, which includes assumptions for the U.S. market as well as our other international and security markets is expected to grow at a combined 2% to 4% rate for 2019.","Based on that total global market assumption, continued internal improvements and the recent Fiberon acquisition, we expect solid top line growth for 2019 with our full year sales increasing 6% to 7.5% over 2018 or approximately 3% to 5% on an organic basis.","On this market, the sales growth, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS before charges and gains in the range of $3.53 to $3.77. This is an outlook we have linked tightly to the softer market we saw in the second half of 2018. We're also assuming, we want to address tariffs and continued inflation with expense control, supply chain actions and pricing, in order to deliver on our plan.","So, in summary, our 2019 outlook is based on more moderate market growth assumptions. We continue to execute on our growth strategy and I feel good about the momentum that our teams are carrying into the year.","On top of the improvements we made to our core portfolio, 2018 was a solid year for capital deployment. We acquired Fiberon, we purchased $695 million of shares, and again increased our quarterly dividend. Additionally, I'm very pleased with the timing of our $600 million investment credit bond deal and the rate \u2013 secured on the financing.","We'll continue to focus on creating meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong free cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. In 2019, however we anticipate the overall pace of M&A activity to be quieter in the first half, and for the year you will likely see us balance continued to share buyback, modest M&A and some natural deleveraging given our planned EBITDA and cash flow growth.","We currently have $414 million remaining on our existing authorization for share repurchases. Regarding acquisitions we continue to look for long-term opportunities that make sense strategically with a focus on plumbing and door.","We have a strong pipeline of opportunities, but tellers maybe apprehensive in the current environment, especially in the first half of the year. If market growth improves throughout the year and there is more clarity on trade M&A activity could pick up.","With that, I will not on the call over to Pat who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our guidance.","Pat Hallinan","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. As Brian mentioned, the best reflect on-going business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.","Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.4 billion, up 3% from a year ago despite a softer second half market which impacted all of our business. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $181 million, down $5 million or 3% compared to the same quarter last year.","Consolidated operating margin declined 70 basis points to 12.7% as lower volumes, inflation and onetime items insecurity impacted margins. EPS were $0.86 for the quarter and grew 8% versus $0.80 same quarter last year. For the full year EPS were $3.34 versus $3.08 last year, increasing $0.26 or 8%.","These results were below our plan and expectations and reflect a market that was significantly softer in the second half of the year than we anticipated even 90 days ago.","As we enter 2019, all of our businesses are prepared to manage expenses and capital tightly, during what we expect to be a soft first half. Certainly, they\u2019re focused on growing in the most promising portions of the respective markets. Our 2019 expectation is to grow above market and drive margin improvement and we are well-positioned to do so.","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Plumbing sales for the fourth quarter were $488 million, up $19 million, or 4% driven by strength in U.S. wholesale and China. Acquisitions and FX roughly offset each other with each having roughly a one point impact on sales.","Operating income increased $11 million to $109 million, up 12%. Operating margin for the segment was 22.3% an extraordinary resulted driven by excellent management of inflation and expenses as the market softened throughout the second half of the year. For the full year, Plumbing sales of nearly $1.9 billion increased $163 million, or 9%. Operating income of $396 million was up $30 million or 8% versus the prior year.","Operating margin was 21%, again a great result given the extreme inflationary pressure throughout the year. The Global Plumbing Group is continuing to deliver on our strategy of growing sales of our market, while maintaining an operating margin around 21%. In 2019, we expect Plumbing sales to grow mid-to-high single digits, but Plumbing Group continues to target operating margin of around 21%.","Turning to Doors & Security. Sales were $307 million, up $20 million or 7% for the prior year quarter. Sales growth was led by another double-digit increase in doors and our Fiberon acquisition partially offset by a double-digit decline in security. Throughout the second half of the year, we moved decisively and aggressively to reposition the security business around its best growth opportunity and setup margin expansion. These actions have included upgrading the leadership team, improving manufacturing and service levels, discontinuing some non-core business and low-margin promotional events and recognizing one-time charges as we reset the business and position it for a strong 2019.","Excluding a non-repeating items and seasonally low Fiberon acquisition, operating margin was 13.3%. For the full year, Doors & Security sales increased 8% to $1.2 billion, operating income was down 5% to $155 million and operating margin came in at 13.1%.","The security product upgrade we made during 2018 presented greater operational challenges than anticipated. Extreme inflation exacerbated the situation. New leadership has improved operational performance and service levels and is addressing price commodity more effectively. We expect the security business to return to growth and margin expansion in 2019.","As Chris mentioned, the President of this group, Brett Finley will address these efforts next week in Boston. In 2019, we expect total Doors & Security sales growth in the high-teens inclusive of the Fiberon acquisition. We expect mid-to-high single-digit organic growth as doors completes its retail rollout and security reignites growth.","Operating margin next year is expected to improve by 100 basis points reflecting the operational and commercial improvements in security and full year of production firm and lapping of the acquisition costs associated with Fiberon.","In Cabinets sales for the fourth quarter were $625 million or flat versus the prior year quarter. Excluding business exits, cabinet sales were up 2%. Sales of in-stock cabinets and vanities grew high single-digit on continued solid demand for these products, excluding the exited U.S. home center business.","Dealer sales increased 1% and saw high single-digit sales growth in stock products primarily sold into a new construction, as we took share with builders in certain parts of the country. Total direct sales were also up high single-digits.","Home center special order sales were down in the quarter, but lesser than earlier in the year, as we applied targeted promotions of a higher price base. Cabinet operating income in the quarter was $62 million, down 7% and operating margin was 10%.","Operating margin was 11.3% adjusting for additional week this year. Our operating margin continues to demonstrate sequential improvement and in the fourth quarter our operating margin exceeded the prior year on an apples-to-apple basis.","In cabinets, a year of transition was expected, but the market was weaker than anticipated in second half. However, our in-stock and stock product lines continue to post a solid high single and mid single-digit growth respectively even in a softer market.","We continue to make progress in expanding the share of this product line. For the balance of our cabinet portfolio, we continue to improve the cost structure to enable margin expansion in 2019 and beyond. In 2019, we expect cabinet sales to grow approximately 3% to 4% and margins to improve by approximately 70 basis points.","To sum-up, consolidated fourth quarter performance, sales increased 3% and EPS were $0.86. The results were below our plan and expectations, however, we are well-positioned to deliver a solid 2019 what is expected to be a softer market.","Our Plumbing and Doors teams continue to outperform the industry and our cabinet business has a starting 2019 with an improved cost structure. Importantly, we have taken the price and strategic steps necessary to deliver improvement in 2019.","For the full year, sales increased 4% and EPS grew 8% to $3.34. Total company operating margin was 12.8% or 80 basis points lower than the prior year.","Now turning to capital deployment, during 2018 we repurchased $695 million in shares. We spent approximately $470 million on the Fiberon acquisition and approximately $115 million on dividends, an increase the 2019 dividend rate by 10%.","2018 free cash flow was $465 million reflecting a conversion rate of 95%. Even after meaningful capital deployment in 2018, our December 31 balance sheet remains solid. Cash was to $263 million, debt was $2.3 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage was 2.4 times. Additionally, we have significant flexibility to finance investments and deploy capital to drive incremental value. Our proven ability to generate solid free cash flow allows us the flexibility to continue to deploy capital to create shareholder value or to de-lever naturally over time.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2019. Based on our assumption of the U.S. housing and global market growth, both in the range of 2% to 4% and continued solid performance by our Plumbing and Doors teams that continue to outperform the market, we expect full year 2019 sales to increase 6% to 7.5% inclusive of the Fiberon acquisition. Excluding Fiberon, we expect 2019 organic sales growth between 3% and 5%.","Our resulting outlook for 2019 EPS are in the range of $3.53 to $3.77. The midpoint of our EPS outlook reflects an increase of over 9%. This 2019 EPS outlook excludes any incremental capital deployment and includes the following assumptions.","Interest expense of around $94 million, a tax rate between 25% and 26% and average fully diluted shares of approximately $142.5 million. For 2019, we expect the first half to present a soft start to the year. We expect first half market growth of 2% to 3%. For the first half, we expect EPS growth of roughly 6% to 7% on sales that are roughly 5% to 6% reported and 3% to 4% organic.","To sum up, fourth quarter and full year EPS were below our expectations, but our overall business model is more flexible and resilient as a result of the changes we have made in response to a softer market and inflation.","Accordingly our 2019 growth projections are based on modest market assumptions. The momentum we have created with the Global Plumbing Group and the new growth avenues we have opened in outdoor living with the Fiberon acquisition give us confidence in continued solid growth and margin expansion in the coming years.","Accordingly we are targeting a 50 basis points consolidated operating margin increase in 2019. You will hear more about our long-term operating margin target for each business next week.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Pat. That concludes our prepared remarks on the fourth quarter of 2018 and our full year 2019 outlook. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you, good afternoon.","Chris Klein","Hi.","Susan Maklari","I guess, to start out with given all the perspective that you have, can you just talk to what you guys are seeing in the market. We've, obviously, had a lot of crosscurrents as it relates to the new home side of the market, the consumers. So I think maybe your perspective in terms of what you've been seeing could be really helpful?","Chris Klein","Sure. On the new construction side, I'd say we saw some softening in the third quarter and when we last to talk to you 90 days ago, we obviously revised down the outlook. It fell off more significantly in November, December, which I think is pretty widely understood now. And I think we just saw a consumer pullback out of the market both on the new construction side and on the existing housing stock turnover side of the market. And if you look back and if you look at where interest rates were coming into September from that point up through middle of November, they moved up an incremental 50 basis points.","You saw a cumulative impact of a lot of housing inflation really hit kind of tipping point into October, November. And so you saw the consumer pulling back, equity markets pulling back. It hit that side of the marketplace. R&R bridges that remain somewhat resilient, although it came off as well. So I'd say we say R&R weaken in the quarter as well. So we took all that and as we were building our plans for 2019 given that we lag especially new construction side, we approached the marketplace for 2019, I'd say in a -- I don't know if I\u2019d say sober or conservative way, I'll chose sober.","So I think we kind of came into the year and assume that some of the carryover effect of the new construction side will carry over into the first half or especially the first kind of three, four months of 2019. So, really kind of a flat very modest growth in the construction side.","R&R probably continues to be a resilient, but at little softer pace 3% to 4% for the first half. And then we think the market will pick back and get its kind of sealing underneath it and move back through in 2019.","So that's how we build our plans. We were tight on costs. We got a lot of growth coming through. But we just said we're going to be looking at sober start to the year and then roll it through.","And I'd say, okay, we\u2019re sitting at the end of January which is about soft as it gets in terms of December, January are the quietest periods in the construction market. But market is about as we thought. And so I'd say, you look across landscape. And there\u2019s certainly is activity that's starting up again. But it's kind of still early in the year. So our outlook as we kind of projected out for the year looks pretty good as I sit here at the end of January.","So things summarize it, surprise that it got quite a bit softer in the fourth quarter, the underlying fundamentals of the market where still comfortable with in terms of the drivers of housing activity, household formations, the age of the housing stock, disposable income, even consumer confidence, although, the overall consumer confidence index tick down the housing-related portion of that was positive.","So I would say we're optimistic long-term and we're optimistic second half, but I'd say we kind of want to come into the year and just be realistic about how it might start out. So I hope I answered what you were looking in there?","Susan Maklari","Yeah. No. That's very helpful. And I guess just as a follow-up there, you made a lot of progress in 2018 in terms of the pricing really kind of across all segments of the business. ","As we think about this lower growth environment how or what do you think your ability is the kind of retain and hold onto a lot of the progress that you made last year?","And then, I guess within that to, can you talk to some of the benefits that maybe you can see as we move through 2019, as it relates to some of the commodities coming off? And could that possibly be somewhat off an offset?","Chris Klein","Yes. I'll take the first part and then I'll let Pat give a little more detail. I think we talked about pricing last year as, again, taking a lot of small bites of the apple. And so that served us well as we brought it through. And I'd say, it was pretty sticky what we've taken on both in terms of pricing and reduced promotional levels. And so, not concerned -- Pat will give you more detail on our outlook on commodities.","I think we are in a very good sport a relative to the pricing we took the cover off on the communities we saw. On tariffs, we've planned for and absorbing the 10% level and we're planning on having to address the 25% level. Obviously, it's been suspended for now, but again back to our real sober look at the marketplace we are anticipating, if it's going to hit us on March 1, we will take actions to offset that even in the slower-growth environment. So Pat, maybe you want to give a little more detail on commodities in general.","A \u2013 Pat Hallinan","Yeah. One, on pricing and then I'll go to the commodities. I would say as we addressed the inflation of 2018, we did with supply chain and price and the pricing most of that was not per se tied to tariffs scenario. So we don't expect pricing to erode as we ahead into 2019 in any way shape or form.","As I reflect on 2018, we had roughly $90 million of inflation hit our P&L in 2019, about $70 million of that was material inflation inclusive of tariff pressures and not just the 10% 301 tariffs, but plywood tariffs and steel and aluminum tariffs earlier in the year and the balance of that about $20 million was freight and logistics. And we covered it with apply chain actions \u2013 supply chain actions actually offset considerable parts before that hit our P&L. Like just for example at 10% tariff has roughly on an annualized basis $50 million impact to our P&L, but we offset three-fifth of that for the supply chain action before it ever came out.","As we look into 2019, you have a wide range of potential inflation scenario depending on what happened with any additional tariffs. So I would say without, a 25% tariff, we're looking at $55 million to $60 million of inflation, or call it roughly $0.30 of EPS with $20 million to $25 million of that be in freight and logistics and probably $10-plus being just continued adjustment to the realities of the new plywood market as we shifted materials and supply base and then the balance of being all other inflation, so all other bucket relatively modest inflation without other tariffs.","If they were 25% tariffs, the estimate is still consistent with where we where in the third quarter we would say the net hit to us on an annualized basis of 25% tariffs is around $45 million. Of course, we don't expect a full year of that, but all of our teams are prepared to address, if it materializes and they would address it with a combination of supply chain and pricing and all of our teams have scenarios prepared for that to happen. And of course, as the first half of the year unfolds; we can update you on how that plays out.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil Ng","Appreciate seasonally slow to start the year, but after soft patches on the second half, have you seen any signs there's in a pickup, have the customers come back and restock in the inventory? I know you're expecting things we accelerate it bit in the second half is it easier comps or are there any initiatives you have in place that kind of gives you the confidence things will pick up?","Chris Klein","Thanks. The inventory issue kind of hit us in parallel with the softer markets. So as the fourth quarter softened, our channel partners pulled back on inventory as well. So the ordering rate was below POS throughout fourth quarter. So, it was kind of negative [ph] effect on sales overall. That likely won't persist. So, as the market resumes and grow, you will see inventories matching at a minimum POS and if there's an acceleration, they typically will buy-in a little bit more to cover with anticipated some growth.","So the first and second half, it really comes down to carryover effect from the way we exited last year. Our categories lack the overall construction cycle and R&R doesn't really start to pick up until March.","So we just let's say brought forward what we saw as we exited the year in the first part of this year and accommodated for a slower start. And I think the back half of the year; it is more of our performing against the market. We've got a lot of initiatives irrespective of market.","But we are assuming that there is some modest level of growth that resumes in the second half of the year. So, -- and it went up looking for a huge future spike -- we're actually looking for more like 4% to 5% growth in the second half if the first half is 2% to 3% growth. So, kind of, that's the range we're operating in.","Reasonably consist R&R, but the big swinger is softer, new construction in the first half which then picks up and yeah, obviously, there's going to be a bit of a softer comp in the second half too. So, I think it ties up.","In general, we're not making any big leaps of faith. We're looking at market in a very conservative way. And saying okay we're going to run our business against that and we're going to grow EPS at midpoint 9% and we've built our plans, cost structures, and CapEx and otherwise in a way that can deliver on that, so a little bit of logic to flow through all that.","Philip Ng","Okay, that's really helpful. And with the investments you made in Cabinets, can you give us a sense how you're thinking about growth and just incremental margins into that business?","And have you seen any new wins on the value side offering that you have out there? And should we think of any overhang on the margin front because it sounds like you still had some initiatives you're trying to work in 2019? Thanks.","Chris Klein","I think on the markets side, we continue to perform really well in the in-stock cabinet and vanity side of the market as well as the soft part of the business that goes into builder and simpler R&R through dealer.","So, that part of market we are picking up share. And we expect we will continue to pick up share. If I look at the overall pivot plan cabinets, a lot of it is we're just going to emphasize the places we've had success and continue to have success. So, we expect that will continue and continue bringing new products in that part of the market. Pat can tie off second part of that question.","Pat Hallinan","Yes. To add onto the sales and the growth perspective of it, the part of the value segment of the market that you're referring to where we traditionally have been very strong in home centers and in-stock cabinets and vanities.","We are taking that supply chain and bringing it to our broader set of the market and as we talk about next week or day will from our Cabinets group deploying that cost structure and capability into our product launch that takes place in April.","So we plan to leverage the capability we have to grow that business, but we do expect Cabinets industry to grow a bit slower than the rest of the overall building products industry just as consumers' trade to a different price point of Cabinets and you use fewer boxes in their design. So, that's why we're targeting Cabinets growth of roughly 3% to 4% and we think that's roughly going to be the dollar growth of the U.S. market over the near to medium term.","In terms of margin percentage, we felt like we did all of the cost structure things this year we wanted to do. Volume was little bit softer in the back half. We didn't see it as much, that's why we talked about it on an adjusted basis. And we feel like we left the year with a nice cost structure.","We do expect next year -- to finish next year with a 70-plus basis point increase, would get us into that 10.3% range for the year. And we expect to start seeing that right out of the gate in the first quarter, not a 10% in the first quarter, because first quarter is seasonably low, but obviously a big improvement off of a very soft 2018 start to the year.","And then as Chris mentioned and you referred to, we do have more change coming, but we're going to pace that change thoughtfully. We know investors want to see as a drive both sales growth and margin improvement in that business, and so we are going to be pushing to do that consistently each of the next three years, while also absorbing some of that change and not letting the change swamp out the growth. So you should expect us to grow that business then in the low to mid-single digits and to drive 70-plus basis points of margin improvement across each of the next three years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Speer from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Justin Speer","Thanks, guys. Just a point of clarification on the tariffs within your guidance, are you embedding a 25% or a 10% tariffs in your kind of segment margin assumption?","Chris Klein","We're embedding expected increase to 25% in March. So we're assuming that that's going to happen and that we have to recover that, both through supply chain actions and pricing actions. Supply chain actions are, frankly, well underway and well underway to address 10%, and so that's just full on and it's going to recover that portion of it, which is substantial.","And then, the pricing piece of it will take effect when we know for certain when that's going to kick in. So there's a little bit of lag, but it's covered off and anticipated in our guidance. So our guidance, just to be clear, some 10% tariff through March 1 and then pick up to 25% March 1 and for the balance of the year.","Justin Speer","So if we end up being at 10%, let's say, the thing is extended and it's a 10%. And then potentially, if there's a resolution, does that change the calculus in terms of your margin assumptions for the balance of 2019?","Chris Klein","Yes. Back half, I mean, because the recovery actions on pricing are back half weighted, it changes some back half math. So it'll be interesting to see how it transpires as the 10% go away. I mean, we're not assuming that would necessarily happen either, and resolution could be that there is some tariff remaining, I think the market still waiting. Bigger markets are waiting for the tariffs to follow off, assuming aluminum coming out of Canada. But those are still picking up there. We just reacted to the stuff that\u2019s going on and I'd say are being very clear eye, and our plans are constructed for 2019 that way.","Justin Speer","One follow-up in -- I'm sorry, in plumbing\u2026","Chris Klein","Go ahead, Justin.","Justin Speer","In Plumbing, is there any risk of mix now in the business? And if so, what's the margin risk from that potential dynamic? Is that in your calculus at all?","Chris Klein","Yeah. Within Plumbing, it's interesting, because the market has been reasonably stable for us. I think for us, it's a mix between wholesale and retail. And so, our strength, frankly, over the last 18 months has been stronger on the wholesale side. And that is not just a construction depended. That's just stronger performance on that side of the marketplace. So that tends to be richer mix.","Within the construction, consumers still trade up off of where the base package has been even through the second half of the year. So the mix is, I'd say the one piece of the market has been weaker is at a very high end, luxury part of that market is a little softer. But that's a small part of the overall.","So I would say, we are not making heroic improvement in mix. I think we are just being realistic by segment of what we see coming out of it.","Justin Speer","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kim from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Kim","Yeah. Thanks very much guys. Just had another point of clarification here, I think you talked about on the margin side in couple of your segments, in Doors & Security you talked about the Fiberon's stuff impact and the nonrecurring cost being in total 460 bps, I think margin. What was just the Fiberon's stuff portion?","And then in your Cabinets business, I think you talked about the 130 basis point impact from the 53rd week, was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more what that was? And why did that just hit the Cabinets and not the other segments?","Chris Klein","Well we have 53rd weeks of Cabinets first. We had 53rd weeks in most of our businesses as most of our businesses with the exception of doors 13-week quarterly calendar underneath our corporate umbrella which is on a fiscal month-end calendar.","But we have to keep all of the businesses inside of fiscal close week of one another, and so we have to take a 53rd week every once in a while. And Cabinets it's particularly onerous because you have a fixed cost structure where you're paying out fixed cost for that week but you\u2019re shipping almost nothing because it's a holiday week. ","So specifically in Cabinets it was around $15.5 million of sales in the week that was incremental because of the extra week, but it was actually about a $6.6 million hit to profitability. So that's what going on there.","All of our businesses take them and we try not to talk about them. In particular with cabinets the reason we wanted to call it out here is we wanted to give people of viewpoint of how the business was really exiting the year on a run rate performance, given all the cost take out it did during the year.","In the case of Fiberon, Fiberon was about 100 basis points of that adjustment that you referred to. It was in the quarter about, I want to say $29-ish million in sales and maybe an unfavourable $2 million in profits based on some of the cost associated with acquisition like inventory step-up amortization and so forth. We expect that business to be accretive to next year.","Steven Kim","Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for that. And then I guess my second question relates to sort of the outlook for this year. I think you painted it out pretty well. I think you have been very clear, you think the first half of the year is going to be slower to back half; you\u2019re anticipating sort of a normalization.","You're being conservative in incorporating the tariff assumption in there as well. I guess, I was just wanting to clarify a little bit, are you -- is it also your view that 1Q is going to be within that softer first half, that the 1Q would be particularly softer and maybe Q2 will be ameliorating a bit?","And then also, I was wondering if you could lay out what if anything you have seen or incorporating in our outlook for the government shutdown, maybe on back pay for load workers through coming through along with tax refunds in the near future, anything related to the shutdown of our tax refunds in your outlook?","A \u2013 Pat Hallinan","I would take the second of that two-piece question. We don't have any specific assumption in our plan for the government shutdown or for a tax reform as it affects consumers. I would\u2026","Chris Klein","One thing that was beneficial was, throughout they said the tax refunds wouldn't be impacted and new attractive data, as well as we do, tax refunds turn out to be a source of R&R funding. So that was good news. So it could have impacted it, but hopefully it did not, but Pat you can take the second part of the question.","A \u2013 Pat Hallinan","And then -- so, yes, we do expect the first quarter to be, at least from a U.S. and Canadian new construction, we expect the first quarter to quite possibly be negative, because of just the starts momentum that was playing out through the back half of 2018, in particular the starts momentum that all of us saw in October or November.","None of us have yet seen December, but if December's anything like October-November, it kind of drives through a negative new construction scenario for Q1 in both the U.S. and Canada modestly so, because we would kind of take a combination of starts and completions across that horizon.","And then, we think and the second quarter should get us back to flat to slightly below flat for the whole first half on the new construction front. And we would expect R&R to be reasonably resilient, kind of 4% bouncing, plus or minus 50 basis points throughout the year. So R&R, the linchpin, prevents whole things from going negative in the first half.","Steven Kim","Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Weiss from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Timothy Weiss","Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Maybe just going back to cabinets and the margins, I think that the midpoint of the growth in margins gets you to maybe a 30% incremental. You took out some fixed costs in the year in 2018. How much of the profit improvement next year is really that from cycling through a lot of that fixed cost versus what might be volume related? Just trying to see how much visibility you have for the cost lines in cabinets this year?","Chris Klein","Yes. I'd say, it's half the benefit of fixed cost low forward, and then half the fact that -- while we covered off in cabinets, actually cabinets is a division where they covered more than their total inflation during 2018. Much of that happened in the back half of the year, because they will hit very severely in the first half of the year with plywood tariffs, initially hardwood plywood, and then soft plywood was added to that.","And so they are going to be about half price commodity, about half fixed costs as they manage through all of the supply chain changes related to plywood. But that business is still good and you're close. I want to say the incremental leverage maybe more like 28%-ish 29%-ish year in the ballpark there.","Timothy Weiss","Okay. And then that\u2019s good. And then on Plumbing just on the inventory reduction was that in also end retail or was it one of the two channels? And do you expect that to happen again in the first quarter, I just want to be cognizant that the comp in the first quarter Plumbing is kind of particularly tough?","Chris Klein","Yeah. We got a across channels. There was probably a little bit more retail than in our wholesale but it was across channels and it kind of unfolded throughout kind of November, December. It was twofer as the market was \u2013 demand was coming off \u2013 they were already \u2013 even had a weaker rate than that. I think stable it's at a stable rate right now. There is a point where weeks of inventory falls below stocks out and other situation that isn't good for either of us. So I expect \u2013 certainly there couldn\u2019t be a little bit, but I don't expect \u2013 there'll be a significant move up, I think you're going to run it above POS.","Timothy Weiss","And POS \u2013 that was about 6%-ish?","Chris Klein","Yeah.","Timothy Weiss","\u2026in U.S. performing.","Chris Klein","Yeah.","Timothy Weiss","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Look forward to meeting you guys next week.","Chris Klein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes our conference for today.

","With me on the call today are Chris Klein our CEO and Lee Wyatt our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed ample time to address questions that you may have. ","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, overall sales growth accelerated, led by plumbing, and our teams again delivered strong operating margin growth across all segments, driven by a continued focus on growing in the most attractive parts of our market. ","For the full year, we continue to execute our strategy of disciplined profitable growth as we increased earnings per share at 33%, with sales growing 9% and our operating margin exceeding our plan for the year, rising 140 basis points to 13.2%. We also saw early benefits from a recent formation of our global plumbing group, and the strategy is to grow sales faster than the market while maintaining margin. In addition, we delivered incremental growth during the year as we completed the acquisitions of ROHL and Riobel. We purchased $424 million of our shares and again increased our quarterly dividend. Our teams have continued to execute at a high level against our strategy and the momentum we have built positions us well for continued strong performance heading into 2017. ","Let me first take you through some of the fourth quarter highlights and my thoughts on our full year performance in 2016. Then I\u2019ll discuss our view of the U.S. home products market and our 2017 outlook for sales and EPS growth. And finally, I will discuss our upcoming CFO transition. Beginning with the quarter, overall sales increased 6% versus the prior year and 10% when we adjust for the negative impact of calendar shift in our Cabinet segment. Operating margin performance was strong, increasing 130 basis points to 13.3% with solid performance across all operating segments. ","Turning first to the Plumbing segment. Plumbing sales were up broadly in the quarter, increasing 19% overall and low-double-digits excluding our recent acquisitions. Growth in the quarter was driven by a number of changes we made to drive growth in the Plumbing business starting in the fourth quarter of 2015. Specifically, we began focusing and growing sales in segments of the wholesale market with targeted customers, developing and accelerating the launch of new products at retail, employing more sophisticated online marketing tactics, bringing out a new ad agency and reinvigorating our brand positioning and marketing programs, investing in digital marketing capabilities and deepening our pool of talent as we formed the new Global Plumbing Group and focused on the high impact areas. ","Together these changes helped strong sales performance in the fourth quarter and should continue to benefit us going forward. We continue to emphasize product innovation and are becoming more sophisticated in our marketing approach by focusing on digital content and mix across spreads. Overall for plumbing in the fourth quarter, we experienced strong sales and profit growth across our channels. U.S. wholesale and Canada sales were up double-digits while U.S. retail and China sales increased high-single-digits.","Going forward, our strategy will continue to focus on growing sales above market, while maintaining our operating margin and on making accretive acquisitions under our newly formed Global Plumbing Group. We have seen early benefits as we accelerated organic growth in the quarter and again to realize some of the potential from our acquisitions. We continue to believe that we have the ability to reach $2.5 billion in Plumbing sales by 2020.","For our Cabinet segment reported sales were down 1% in the quarter, but grew 7% excluding the impact of the Cabinet division calendar shift, which Lee will detail in a minute. Excluding this impact, sales growth was strong in our core markets, with the exception of some continued softness at the luxury end of the market. Importantly, due to our disciplined focus on profitable growth, we delivered strong operating margin improvement.","Let me cover our Cabinet's highlights, excluding the calendar shift, to give you a sense of our core performance, which accelerated nicely from the third quarter. Sales in our dealer channel trended up, growing mid-single-digits overall. Sales of our core stock and semi-custom dealer lines grew high-single-digits, driven by strength across the Board in our Aristokraft, Homecrest, Schroc, Diamond, Kemper and Mid Continent lines. Sales at the luxury customer end of the market where we saw our Omega, Decora and Ultracraft lines were down modestly in the low-single-digits.","Prior to the second half of 2016, we experienced a two-year run of solid double-digit growth at this very high end of the market, which tends to be more discretionary, cyclical, and tied to certain geographic markets. The softness in the second half of 2016 was focused in the higher income geographic markets including South Florida, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast.","Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanity sales, which represent over 20% of our total Cabinet sales increased at a mid-teens rate due largely to strong sell through of new programs and product upgrades that launched earlier in the year. The balance of our Cabinet business, which includes builder direct home center special order in Canada grew 3%. Sales in the builder direct channel were up double-digits driven by new construction activity and operating margin improved meaningfully as we focused on the regions where we can achieve profitable growth.","In the home center, special order channel, where our competitors were very aggressive on promotions, sales were down slightly. The volume in this part of our business represented only 13% of fourth quarter CapEx revenue and we remain focused on our strategy of disciplined profitable growth. We are committed to growing profitably with our home center customers in this segment, by partnering with them in areas where we can leverage our sustainable competitive advantages, including product innovation, new styles and designer focused tools and customer service enhancements. Lastly, sales were down in Canada, where the economy in the central provinces continue to be challenged by the earlier downturn in the energy market.","So overall for Cabinets, momentum picked up again fourth quarter. Our teams continue to execute well and build on our structural competitive advantages. As the largest Cabinet company in the industry, with the broadest portfolio of brands, price points, products and channels, we have the ability to target and consistently win in attractive segments of the market without resorting to excessive promotions. Our consistent results reflect this focus and I\u2019m pleased by our ability to simultaneously grow and increase operating margin consistently over the last eight years.","Door's reported sales were up 6% for the quarter. Door products saw sales growth driven by gains in both wholesale and retail. The Therma-Tru brand continued strong performance across both channels, with mix and efficiency driving 170 basis points of operating margin improvement. New products continued to be important to this business, and we had success with our new door styles as well as decorative glass. Our team has been able to build momentum by enhancing the capabilities of our wholesale fabricated network and by building successful programs in retail. In the security segment, sales increased 6% for the quarter. High single-digit increases in Master Lock US retail, commercial and international throughout the growth.","Safe sales were limited in the quarter as we worked to ramp up our new facility. The recent integration of Sentry safe and Master Lock continue to drive profit improvement and we remain excited about the top line opportunities we see in these two brands over the next few years.","So to recap the quarter, we executed our strategy very well in improving U.S. home products market, delivering solid sales growth and exceptional profit growth. Reflecting on the full year we delivered a very strong performance on multiple dimensions in 2016. Against the backdrop of a steadily improving housing market, coupled with the stronger business model we have created, we just achieved one of our best years ever, capping an impressive five year run of consistently increasing sales, earnings and operating margin.","While our teams have executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results in 2016, and even we're excited about the foundation that we have built to drive both organic and incremental growth over the next five years. Housing market demand drivers continue to be solid, and with the highly capable management team and strategy we have in place, we are extremely well positioned, not just for 2017 but for the next several years.","Switching back to 2016, in the full year we grew sales by 9%, earnings by 33% and increased total company operating margin by 140 basis points, which exceeded our plan. Importantly, inside of each business we made a number of significant changes to enable us to continue to deliver profitable growth. In Plumbing, we created the new Global Plumbing Group, a key platform that will enable accelerated organic and incremental growth for years to come, while maintaining the strong operating margins for the segment.","In Cabinets, we grew at above market rates in the parts of the market that we targeted for profitable growth and continue to improve mix of efficiency, which increased segment operating margin by 180 basis points. In Doors, our full year operating margin rose by 320 basis points, and we reached record levels of working capital efficiency. We launched new products in wholesale and that retail and drove continued sales in operating income growth. And in security, we completed the integration of the SentrySafe supply chain into our operating platform and have already begun to realize profitability improvement with full year operating margin up 160 basis points.","Beyond these strategic actions, we also deployed capital in value creating ways as we completed two plumbing acquisitions, re-purchased shares and again increased our quarterly dividend. Moving forward we will continue to focus on creating meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders.","Our acquisition pipeline continues to be active, and I'm encouraged by the number of things we are working on and the potential we have to create incremental shareholder value over time. We are closely monitoring potential changes to regulatory trade and other governmental policies, as it may make some opportunities we are working on more attractive and others less attractive. Over the next two to three years, we believe we'll continue to have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive this incremental growth in shareholder value.","Now let me turn to our full year outlook for 2017, starting with our of the U.S. home products market. Our 2017 annual outlook is built on an assumption that the U.S. home products market, which impacts over 70% of our sales grows at a 6% to 7% rate which is slightly less than last year's market growth due to the challenging comps in the first quarter. Within that overall assumption, we anticipate that the pace of repair and remodel demand in 2017 grows at a rate of 4.5% to 5%. We see consumers continue to demonstrate an appetite for stronger styling, product differentiation and project complexity, which will continue to improve mix across our categories.","New home construction is assumed to grow at high single digits in 2017. Single family is expected to continue to grow faster than multifamily, and single family entry level activity is expected to continue to accelerate.","Our total global market, which includes assumptions for the U.S. market as well as our other international home securities markets is expected to grow at a combined 5% to 6% for 2017. Based on that total global market assumption, continued share gains, plus the ROHL and Riobel acquisitions, we expect solid top line growth for 2017, with our full year sales increasing 6% to 8% over 2016. With this market and sales growth, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS in the range of $2.95 to $3.05.","So overall, our 2017 outlook is based on reasonable market growth assumptions, based on the basket of indicators that we monitor. We'll continue to execute on our growth strategy and I feel good about the winning momentum that our teams are carrying into the year. Before I turn the call over to Lee, I wanted to talk about his transition to retirement at the end of the year and some of the things that we've been able to establish in the time he's been here.","Over the last 5.5 years, we have significantly strengthened our management team, including all areas of finance function. We've added stronger functional leaders and created a more robust set of processes across all areas. Lee's successor, Pat Hallinan, will step into a strong finance team. He is deeply familiar with our approach and strategy, having worked in our two largest businesses, Cabinets and most recently Plumbing. He is a proven leader that fits in well with our high-performance culture that is focused on creating shareholder value through a focus on profitable growth. ","Because of the strong leadership and processes we've been able to establish, I see the eventual transition from Lee to Pat as seamless. Additionally, Lee will be with us throughout the year to ensure a smooth handout. At the right time, I will thank Lee for his many contributions to our company and will wish him the best as he prepares for retirement. However, we have a strong 2017 ahead of us with plenty of exciting opportunities unfolding. So I'll hold off on those comments until later in the year when he steps away.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Lee who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our guidance.","Lee Wyatt","Thanks Chris and good afternoon. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. ","Let me start with our fourth quarter results. Sales were $1.3 billion, up 6% from a year ago, in spite of challenging comps from the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of a calendar shift in our Cabinet segment, total company sales increased 10%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $173 million, up 18% or $26 million compared to the same quarter last year. Consolidated operating margin improved 130 basis points to 13.3%. EPS was $0.71 for the quarter versus $0.56 for the same quarter last year, increasing 27% and were at the high end of our guidance range. ","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our Plumbing sales for the fourth quarter were $426 million, up $68 million or 19%, led by U.S. retail, U.S. wholesale, Canada and China. Sales excluding acquisitions increased low-double digits. Our new global plumbing group is executing our strategy, and in 2017 we expect plumbing sales to grow by double digits for the full year, including the recent acquisitions. Operating income increased $17 million to $88 million, up 23%. Operating margin for the segment was 20.6%, up 80 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the full year, plumbing sales increased to 8.5%, operating income was up 14% over the prior year and operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21.7%.","Turning to Cabinets. Our Cabinet business had a favorable calendar shift in the fourth quarter of 2015 that increased sales for all channels. More specifically, the fourth quarter of 2015 included nine shipping weeks prior to the Thanksgiving week, while the fourth quarter of 2016 had only eight weeks. These are the highest volume weeks of the season.","Additionally, the fourth quarter of 2015 included three more regular shipping days. The full impact of this calendar shift was an additional $45 million in sales in 2015. To best understand year-over-year business trends in the segment, it\u2019s necessary to exclude this impact. Reported sales were $601 million, down $7 million or 1% versus the prior year quarter. However, sales increased 7% for the Cabinet segment when you adjust for the calendar shift. Reported dealer sales of $300 million were down 3% from the prior year, but were up 5% excluding the calendar shift, which strength across core product lines.","Reported sales in-stock cabinets and vanities of $130 million increased 7%, but 15% excluding the calendar shift, driven by strong sell through of new products. Reported sales in the home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada of $171 million were down 4%, but increased 3% excluding the calendar shift. With builder, direct up strong double-digits and home center and semi-custom in Canada down for the reasons Chris described earlier. Importantly, margin improved in all of our channels. Even in home center semi-custom, where sales decline modestly as competitors drove elevated promotional activity, we remain disciplined and chose to grow operating margin. This improvement in margin across our channels is a sign that our strategy, which remains focus on disciplined, profitable growth is the right one for our business.","Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased 4% over the prior year quarter, with operating margin increasing 60 basis points to 10.6%. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 11.1%, excluding an increase in bad debt reserve related to the direct bankruptcy filing during the quarter. For the full year reported Cabinet sales increased 10% over the prior year and operating income grew 33% to $260 million, with the operating margin increasing 180 basis points to 10.8%. This significant increase in profitability was driven by our team's discipline focused on growing in the most attractive parts in to the market and not chasing lower margin sales.","Overall, we remain pleased with the underlying strength in our Cabinet business and by our ability to drive margin improvement; and expect Cabinet sales to grow by high-single-digits in 2017 with continued operating margin improvement. Door sales were $122 million, up $7 million or 6% from the prior year quarter. Sales were up in all channels and operating income increased $3 million to $16 million, up 22%. Operating margin was 13.3% for the quarter, up 170 basis points. For the full year, Door sales increased 8%, operating income grew 42% and operating margin increased 320 basis points to 15.2%. We expect 2017 operating margin in the Door business to be over 14%.","Security sales were $153 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% for the prior year. Segment operating income increased to $24 million, up 28% and the segment operating margin was 260 basis points higher at 15.6%. The improved operating margin reflects the benefit of the Sentry Safe integration. For the full year, security sales increased 5%, operating income increased 18% from the prior year and operating margin was 14.1%. We expect to increase operating margin in the security business to around 15% for the full year 2017.","To sum up consolidated fourth quarter performance, sales increased 6% and EPS were at the high end of our range at $0.71. Our total company operating margin increased 130 basis points to 13.3%, with an incremental margin of 45%, excluding acquisitions. For the full year 2016, sales increased 9% and EPS grew 33% to $2.75 including $0.16 of tax benefit related to the accounting change for equity compensation. Total company operating margin was 13.2%, a 140-basis point improvement. We are well on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state levels.","Turning now to capital deployment. During 2016, we repurchased $424 million in shares, including $61 million in the fourth quarter and we bought an additional $27 million in January of this year. We spent $260 million on plumbing acquisitions and approximately $100 million on dividends and increased the 2017 dividend rate.","2016, free cash flow was $531 million and reflects the benefit of over $80 million of reduced working capital. Even after the significant level of capital deployment in 2016, our December 31 balance sheet remains solid. Cash was $251 million, debt was $1.4 billion and our net debt to EBITDA leverage was 1.5 times. Additionally, we had significant capacity under our revolving credit facility to continue to deploy capital to drive incremental growth.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2017. Based on our projected 6% to 7% U.S. home products markets growth and our total global market growth of 5% to 6%, as well as continued share gains in our areas of strategic focus, we expect full year 2017 sales to increase 6% to 8% compared to 2016. Our resulting outlook for 2017 EPS are in the range of $2.95 and $3.05. The midpoint of our EPS outlook reflects an increase of 14% when you exclude the benefit of the accounting change for equity compensation on our tax rate of $0.16 in 2016 and $0.05 in 2017. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions. Interest expense of around $50 million, a tax rate of around 32.5% and average fully diluted shares of approximately $157 million.","In summary, the fourth quarter and full year EPS had strong growth. The solid performance of our business through the year, the platform we have created with the global plumbing group and the expected continued market recovery give us confidence in continued solid growth in the coming years. Importantly, the 140 basis point operating margin increase in 2016 and continued increase in our 2017 outlook places on track, is not ahead of our timeline for achieving our long term operating margin targets.","Also, as demonstrated by the Riobel and ROHL acquisitions, share re-purchases and the dividend rate increase, we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value. And our credit facility agreement provides significant flexibility to continue to drive incremental shareholder value.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks on the fourth quarter of 2016 and our full year 2017 outlook. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions. And since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I will ask that you limit your initial questions to two, and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Philip Ng from Jefferies.","Philip Ng","I guess the first question for me, as you pointed out in the release, the uncertainty will add a little noise to the recovery and with interest rates going up, just wanted to get your view on where are we in the cycle, the shape of the recovery as we look at 2017, because the last time I think rates did go up off a very low base. There seem to be some pre-buy ahead of that and demand kind of faded. Just want to get your thoughts on how you guys are positioned this year?","Chris Klein","If we look across a whole number of drivers that we follow, I'd say interest rates is really important, but everything else we're looking at continues to point up. Consumer confidence is up. Household formations continue to expand beyond where we're building to. So if you look at assessments of household formations around 1.4 million in 2016 plus 200,000 demolitions, we are not building at a level of 1.6 million at this point in the cycle. Unemployment is down, purchase loan activity is up, variability credit is good, household debt levels are low. So assume there was a tick up in rates but all the other things that we follow look quite positive.","Fourth quarter, definitely saw an increase in starts to attract the public builders. Looked like order rates continued to be strong coming out fourth quarter end of the first quarter. So on the new construction side we are actually looking at '17 as being a good year. We think it will be in aggregate like '16 but the weighting will be a little bit different. By the time, it starts to kick in, it will be later in the first quarter and then second quarter, third quarter we should see some very strong performance coming through on that side. On the R&R side, I think we're looking at R&R growth for the year around 5%, first quarter probably a little soft. We had such strong comps last year and then probably a little better than 5% quarters two, three, four. So I think the market is setting up to be okay. I think obviously, it will pick up an interest rates. But we don\u2019t think it's going to suck the area out of the marketplace. ","Philip Ng","Okay very helpful. And I guess switching gears to Cabinets, constructive, encouraging hear you say high-single digit growth for the full year. But can you provide a little more color on just the competitive activity called out in the home center channel. I think you did call out a little weakness in luxury as well. Do you expect that to have any impact as we think about this year? And is there anything we need to be mindful in terms of the calendar shifts that you saw in '16? What the impact would be this year? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Chris Klein","Thank you. So I'll start with the last piece, the calendar shift beyond us. So we should have comparable calendars this year. We can talk about that and give you a little more detail on that. But I think as we look at a comparable apples-to-apples, quarter was up 7% for cabinets, strong growth in dealer, semi-custom, harder market, we're up high single, low-double there, in stock vanities, mid-teens, builder direct.","And you mentioned that the home center promotional activity. That's about 13% of our sales for the quarter. And I guess, if I look back over the last eight years, from time-to-time one of our competitors or the other of our large competitors will go very aggressive on promotions. We've been disciplined and we've been focused on taking the business that is at a good margin. And so we haven't chasing down the rabbit hole and just throwing money after it. We'd rather invest our money in products and service and training for the designers. So it hurts a little bit, but the reality is once they came off-promotion, volume came back to us. So I'd rather do that and take the business that I got at good profit margins and let the other guys chase -- throw money at promotions and chase it.","On the very high end in custom, which is about 10% of our Cabinet business, there we saw softness the whole second half, we as a industry did. If you looked at TCMA [ph] data that that was reported, a lot of TCMA [ph] these are smaller regional guys reporting in, that in parts of the market South Florida, the Northeast and Atlantic we saw some weakness in that very high end of the market. That's off of two really strong years. So we had kind of a two year surge in that part of market. A lot of that R&R activity coming out of savings, equity market, not a lot of borrowing in that part. And there seemed to be a pause. Based on the traffic that we're seeing in the showrooms and talking with our dealers, it appears to be coming back but it's early. It's January. So we'll see how it unfolds. So I'd say little soft but given how small it is for our total business, didn't hurt too bad. And clearly, we were able to continue to drive margin improvement in the core of the business because the mix held up throughout. ","Operator","The next question is from Tim Wojs from Baird. ","Tim Wojs","Good. I guess just maybe first question. As you look at kind of the cadence through the year, could we just kind of -- maybe as a percentage of full year EPS or something like that, can we just, is there a way to think about what Q1 should look like relative to maybe historical patterns as a percentage of the full year? EPS, or revenue or margins?","Lee Wyatt","Yes, I think if you -- you'd start with first quarter of '17. It's growing against the tough comp obviously with the market being up with the additional good weather days we had in the first quarter of \u201916. So when you think about our full year sales, a range of 6% to 8%. I\u2019d say the first quarter probably is at the low end of that. I think as you get into the second half, you are at the high end of that. So kind of a natural progression in terms of sales.","In terms of EPS, if you back out this impact of the accounting change on the tax rate, which was $0.16 in 2016 and will be $0.05 in 2017, if you back that out, and you should have that by quarter, what you see is a pretty consistent EPS growth quarter-over-quarter. So somewhere from -- on average for the year it\u2019s 14% up. So I think you\u2019ll see anywhere from 10% to 15% on a quarterly basis throughout the year, with the first half being at the lower end of that and the second half being at the higher end.","Tim Wojs","Okay, okay. And then just, when you think about incremental, so I think just kind of back of the envelope, I get about 25% or some incremental margin on sales. So one is my math right there? And then two, how are you guys thinking about just price cost and maybe some of the mix impact? I know Chris you mentioned entry levels picking up a little bit on the new construction side. How we should about price cost and mix in 2017 on margins?","Lee Wyatt","So incremental, I think if you -- we\u2019re still annualizing the two acquisitions on the Global Plumbing Group. Think if you back that out, incremental margins are a little over 30% at the midpoint of our guidance. So we think that\u2019s good. It reflects this disciplined process of growth. I think at the midpoint of the guidance you\u2019d see an operating margin approaching 14%. We were 13.2% this year, a little bit ahead of our sales, because annually we went about 100 basis points. So we were 140 basis points growth company-wide in \u201916, maybe it\u2019s 80 or 90 in \u201917, but gets us around that 14%, which says we\u2019re right on track.","Chris Klein","A lot of that is coming out of price mix. We see that across all the businesses, looking across Plumbing, continue to improving mix there. Within Cabinets, even as he said, if we're going more entry level, we continue to drive mix-up in that part of the market. So seeing doors, continued attachment rate on glass, decorative glasses, into there. So we\u2019ve been able to achieve that mix improvement across the whole board.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. ","Bob Wetenhall ","So when I look back in 2016, I think the highlight for me is the margin expansion that you guys continued to deliver, irrespective of the operating environment. It\u2019s 130 basis points year-over-year, speaks to strong execution and having a very attractive portfolio. What are we, Chris or Lee to jump off going into next year, can we still expect 100 basis points of operating margin expansion? What should expectations to be after a very strong 2016 on the margin side?","Lee Wyatt","Yes. I think if you look again at the mid-point of our guidance, that\u2019s around 14% operating margins. So you take the two years \u201916 and \u201917, that would be 240 basis points improvement. So we're right on track in terms of margins. We're right on track, probably a little bit head of our long term perspective of 14% to 15% operating margins at steady state. And it all comes back Bob, and Chris can elaborate on this focus on profitable growth on improving mix and efficiencies across all of our business.","Chris Klein","And it\u2019s really, it\u2019s going to -- within -- if you think about it for a second, it\u2019s within the businesses and then it\u2019s across the portfolio. So within the businesses, if I look at Cabinets, we continue to drive that margin improvement by improving the mix and the proportion of business that\u2019s coming through more attractive parts of the market. So we're kind of managing that within the portfolio. So it gets too skinny on margin, we're not too aggressive on that, and that is part of the reason why we're not going to be too aggressive on some of this promotional activity you see.","If you also look across the portfolio, as we're growing plumbing faster than the market and we\u2019ve got very good margins in that other market and clearly demonstrating, we're putting that business on a higher growth trajectory, that shifts the overall balance of the margin within the portfolio a little bit more toward that part of the market and that benefits us. Inside of Doors, inside of Security, we continue to manage that. So it's kind of across the board inside the businesses as well as how we manage it across the businesses. So I would say we are on a good track. We've been executing on this strategy really four, five years. Once we got through the point where volume is going to cover fixed costs, we explicitly, we are driving profitable growth, we're driving it in every corner of the business and you can see quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year our performance shows that.","Bob Wetenhall ","Yes, it was \u2013 it was a great quarter. You guys definitely to serve some serious recognition. Wanted to switch gears for a second. You guys did two M&A transactions on the plumbing side, following before that SentrySafe, but it seems like the emphasis on building out the Plumbing platform and where are you guys, what do you see in the pipeline? Do you think if you buy something it\u2019s a public market or private market vehicle? There\u2019s a lot of questions about taking the legacy businesses you have now and what can be done to get them to the GPG growth targets you talked about. And I\u2019m just trying to understand is there enough opportunity, the opportunity set big enough on M&A that you guys are going to be able to achieve those GPG growth targets you laid out?","Chris Klein","Yeah, I think we are very active, we are looking on a plumbing sector, we are looking on in some other sectors, but we are definitely focusing plumbing. If you look at the organic growth and growing faster than the market, a portion of that target is going to come, probably at least half of it is coming from organic growth and then a portion is going to come out of acquisitions. So there is not \u2013 there's not a huge hurdle to me on acquisitions. The reality is if we're successful, they could in excess. But I think we targeted a balance between those two and so if you look at the trajectory Plumbing's on, coming out of the fourth quarter and say okay, backing that into the next few years, I can see where a portion of that organically as well as we are looking at. Third part of your question was how much of this is private, how much is public? It\u2019s a mix depending on sector. We are looking at a couple of public situations, but I can\u2019t give any more detail on that and then a lot of assets around the world are still privately held and those are long lead times that we have been working for a long time and you just kind of see where our catalysts in the market that could make some of those things happen. So continue to work those situations.","Bob Wetenhall ","And just to confirm, how do you feel about the pipeline, like is it full or do you guys feel like \u2026","Chris Klein","Yes, I feel good. I think one of my comments in my prepared remarks is that we are taking stock of any regulatory trade tax impacts. And some of those maybe quite positive, meaning that we are a large U.S. manufacturer with assembly operations, manufacturing operations in the U.S. Now 70% of our employees are in the U.S. and we are big U.S. tax payer, 32% type of tax rate. So that may change and make some things seem more attractive for us as we look at M&A. There are other things that by way of mix could be less attractive. So factoring that in, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s slowing down. There are things that we're working on that work irrespective, but certain things that those changes could impact, we're taking stock of that.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","First question, I just wanted to drill down a little bit on your comments on the first quarter and first half versus the second half. And Lee I think you alluded to first quarter sales growth potentially being at the lower end of the 6% to 8% range, which would be pretty impressive given the comp of 16% growth rate there. And likewise, in Cabinets, the lights out performance you had 30% plus there. So just trying to get a sense of, drilling down by segment, would you expect cabinet to be positive in the first quarter, because again also with the high single digit growth for the full year, which is a little more than we were expecting as well, just trying to get a sense of perhaps what's driving that high single digit growth number, because clearly it would seem that there is some nice market share gains built in there and how that fits into your first quarter outlook?","Lee Wyatt","I think as you look at being at the low end of that range, could be five to six, it's in that range. I think Cabinets does have a challenging comp. I think they will be ok. Is that 4, 5, or 6 it's probably in that range. Keep in mind on the global Plumbing group, we're annualizing the acquisitions of ROHL and Riobel. So that will cause them to be probably double digit growth when you include that acquisition activity. And then in doors and security or at kind of that wall in. So I'm comfortable saying would be somewhere in that vicinity of the low end, is it 5% or 6%, it's all in there. But the global plumbing group will give you nice boost.","Michael Rehaut","Yes, certainly. We are definitely counting on that. I guess just second question on capital allocation and in specifically share re-purchase. We were mainly expecting a little bit more share re-purchase, we were maybe expecting a little more share repurchase in the fourth quarter given the pull back in the stock and I think historically you've been pretty opportunistic. When you've had decent pull backs in the stock like you saw in the fourth quarter. At the same time you alluded a reference to your intent focus on growing out GPG and maybe being on the sideline or maybe being a little bit of a wait and see mode with regards to the regulatory environment. So just trying to -- in piecing it all together, how should we interpret I guess maybe more of a call it lighter share buyback relative to the pullback. Is there -- should we be thinking about it more that the acquisition pipeline like you said is still pretty active and there are things that may hit sooner than later? Or you're really just trying to maybe play it a little more conservative until some of the regulatory backdrop clears up. ","Chris Klein","So I think it's a combination of things. I think clearly we were active in the fourth quarter and in January and buying back shares and we'll continue to monitor kind of where the market is trading. And we think that as you see by our actions that at press levels a little bit later than where we are, those are good points for us. And we'll be opportunistic as we have been. ","On the other hand, there I think we're looking at that we can deploy capital against on the acquisition side and we'll keep investing internally. If I look back really over the last five years, we've been pretty consistent in saying we're going to be very efficient with our cash flow and appropriately aggressive. So I think we've deployed quite a bit capital over the last five years, slightly more into acquisitions than on share repurchases with consistency on the dividends. And I think that\u2019s our plan coming into the year. ","So I don't know that you should expect that much difference from the way we've been playing it out. But if I look over the last three years it's probably a good template for how we're going to play out over the next couple of years in terms of combination of things. And that obviously tilts it more aggressively towards acquisitions. We're busy at looking at a lot of different things, but I never force it there. So to the extent that we're successful on a number of the things that we're working on, titled more so on the acquisition side. So I guess that's about as much specificity as I can provide. ","Operator","The next question is from Scott Rednor from Zelman & Associates. ","Scott Rednor","Hey good afternoon. Chris I was just hoping if you could just talk about how quickly you could move or adjust your capacity in two scenarios? One would be if interest rates did cause new residential construction as well as materially, how quick could you adjust the plans and how quick could the business respond? And then similarly if there were some kind of border tax adjustment, just how much of the footprint is in Mexico or abroad and could you change the sourcing model in that scenario?","Chris Klein","Yes, we've got a lot of flexibility in what we've built. If I go probably back to the downturn, we've restructured and made decisions around what hubs we were going to build as we came back up again. And so within that footprint we can staff up and staff down. And we've had to do that throughout. The last eight years of recovery hasn't been a straight line. So there are quarters or parts of the year where we've have to pull back and then we've have to surge and staff. so we're good at that. And so I'd say on that we watch it very closely, we watch a lot of the macro factors and then we also watch inside of our own business and adjust staffing appropriately. And to the extent we need to move aggressively, we move aggressively. We are on the side of moving harder and stressing the system as opposed to waiting patiently and that's kind of been the way we've run the business. So I feel really good about that. We've got a great team, and we're on it. ","In terms of kind of the outcome of any of the proposals being talked about, we're looking at all of that very carefully, we're not making any decisions until things get sorted out and I think there\u2019s some continued proposals on the table. I\u2019d start with we are a big U.S. manufacturer. We\u2019ve got about 70% of our people in the U.S. We\u2019ve got another 10% in Canada. So if I look outside U.S. and Canada, you\u2019re talking about kind of roughly 20% between China, Mexico and Europe. And so we\u2019ve got flexibility in those operations and we just have to see how the impact of any of these changes are going to collectively hit us in terms of obviously reduction in tax rate. ","If you are paying in the 30s, anything anybody is talking about and take it down, and we're also looking at the strength of the currency one way or the other and looking at any other taxes or tariffs. And so we\u2019ll be pretty deliberate about make any changes, but we\u2019ve got flexibility in the system, we can repurpose facilities, where we can ship things and will react accordingly. That\u2019s a good about where we see competitively. I think it actually could present some interesting opportunities for us. Again starting with the fact that we're a big U.S. employer with a big U.S. -- fat [ph] tax rate, and so while that hasn\u2019t been competitively a great advantage, it looks like that maybe going forward. So we\u2019re again, just looking at things from a fact-base way, waiting for things to unfold, and as they unfold, we\u2019re going to be taking some pretty deliberate actions around it as you could imagine.","Scott Rednor","I appreciate the lengthy response. Lee, did you make any comments around plumbing margins in \u201917 and then just quickly, if there is still benefit on the tax line, sounds like still nickel. Why with the full year tax rate go all the way back to 32.5?","Lee Wyatt","Couple of things on the operating margins at the midpoint of the guidance. I think going up, let\u2019s call it 14%, you\u2019d see all the operating companies improve their margin. The one that might be flattish or slightly down potentially could be the Global Plumbing Group, because remember our strategy there is to grow faster than the market and maintain operating margin. So anything around 21% operating margins for Global Plumbing Group if we were driving sales above market would be very successful.","So that\u2019s the one you could see flat to maybe even slightly down, if we're growing above market nicely. So that is the strategy, but overall going to 13.2% operating margin to around \u201914 is a pretty strong year. And on the tax rate. So remember that we had $0.16 benefit in \u201916, basically driven around, and that\u2019s all in that equity comp accounting change. And looking at what we think might get -- what options might get exercised, it\u2019s really hard to estimate that obviously. We think that\u2019s about $0.05. So that benefit in \u201916 was about 400 basis points on our tax rate. So you think about a tax rate that was 28.7%, in \u201916, you add 420 basis points back for the impact of that accounting change and you get to 32,933. So that was the rate without that. You do the same thing in \u201917, we talk about 32.5% tax rate at the midpoint of the guidance, you had back impact of $0.05, it'd get you to around 33 or so, 33.5. So slightly up, but very consistent in terms of our base tax rate.","Operator","The next question is from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","John Lovallo","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my call. The first question just following up on the border tax question, more specifically just on the Plumbing business where a lot of manufacturing is done overseas. If there was a border taxing, are there strategies that could you have to kind of mitigate the impact? And then ultimately do you think that the cost is going to be passed on to consumers?","Chris Klein","Yes, it\u2019s probably just to say cost is going to go over there. I think if you look at our plumbing business, we\u2019ve got a global supply chain that feeds components into our assembly operation, which is based in North Carolina. And so that model sources from around the world. Who knows how uniform tariffs are going to be, or the application if taxes are going to be. But as an industry, we\u2019ll all be sourcing components similarly. I think proportionally we're advantaged, because we are doing assembly for the U.S. market in the U.S. and I'd say there is a lot of finished goods that are coming into the Plumbing market that are actually assembled overseas. And so our proportion of that tariff or tax would be lower than our competitors.","So this is why I made a comment earlier that there are things that could actually benefit us, because we\u2019ve got this base in the case of plumbing assembly operation. In Cabinets, we are actually building Cabinets here in the U.S. quite significantly. We\u2019ve got a huge employee base and a big manufacturing operation. And so again maybe sourcing some components or raw materials globally, a huge proportion the value-add that we\u2019re bringing into that product is here in the U.S. So you got to look at I guess, you look at it competitively and say where are we relative to who we're competing against by segment and then where is the impact. And not much of that gets back to the system. I guess we\u2019ll see what form it takes as its coming at us.","John Lovallo","Okay. Yeah, that\u2019s helpful. And then I think last year you may have given a free cash flow and CapEx outlook. Just wondering if you guys might provide that?","Lee Wyatt","Yes, we -- this year net CapEx in \u201916 was $145 million. I think we'll probably be in that $140 million range this year. Free cash flow, very strong obviously in \u201916, $531 million and we actually had a couple of things that really drove improvements in working capital. Actually in \u201916 working capital improved to a positive for the year of $80 million as we did a couple of things we -- we cleared some inventory that we had built during our transition of the Global Plumbing Group, some of the Asia manufacturing and then for the security, the transition of the SentrySafe. So we build safety stock there. We\u2019ve now kind of taken that down. We also looked at just the need to focus on working capital. Our WCE is down to about 15% right now. So we had some good onetime benefits in \u201916 that won\u2019t repeat for the same level. I would say probably and we're still kind of working to be honest on that free cash flow plan. I think you could see $425 million, $450 million of free cash flow next year and that\u2019s assuming we go back to kind of a normal growth in the working capital. So still very, very strong growth and strong free cash flow.",".","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","Good job on the quarter. Just a quick -- the first question is talking about the political environment and the regulatory environment. You had mentioned a very sensible sort of approach to how you might handle any kind of border tax issues or domestic tax policy and you sort of said that you\u2019d move fast, hard and fast but you\u2019d also wait for some certainty and I guess I was thinking that probably that same kind of balance would inform the way you would approach acquisitions perhaps, which would perhaps adjust that we might be sort of for installing any actual direct action there until maybe the back half of the year. But I wanted to see if I have that wrong and if you could correct me on whether that's the right or wrong way that to be thinking about your M&A strategy this year? ","Chris Klein","Yes, there are things we're working on right now that work irrespective of changes that are going to be made. So there are things that are maybe more domestic which we're taking domestic and adding into domestic. We're operating in the country and we're going to add to that country within the parameters of that country. I think anything that had got a cross-border component, we want make sure kind of where things are tracking and whether we're bringing things in here to benefit from our manufacturing or whether they've got a global supply chain that would have to be reoriented around my earlier comments.","So those are things that there is certainty, and it looks like it could be significant that you might wait on. But it doesn't mean that our M&A strategy is wait and see. We're active on some things right now that could materialize in the first half of the year if things line up okay. It's just, clearly we're not going to jump into something that might be subject to changes in trade policy or changes in tax policy until that could sort it out. And I don't know how quicker that will get sorted out. So we're not going to -- we'll just be aggressive in watching that and understanding how it impacts both our current business as well as anything we're looking at. ","Stephen Kim","Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Okay, thanks very much for that. And I'm sorry I forgot to mention that Lee we will definitely miss you, but glad you're sticking around for a while so we can continue to pass through you. So we appreciate you giving us a chance. ","Lee Wyatt","I'll get a few more shots Adam. --.","Chris Klein","Great. Second question I had related to your special-order business in cabinets. I guess could you just help us on the big picture try to contrast the situation that you see in the home center special order cabinet business too. Sort of what was emerging or what evolved in the builder direct business which obviously you took a step out of couple of regions and things like that. Can you just sort of contrast the situation the way you see it between these two businesses?","Chris Klein","Home center special order is an important business to us. It's just in proportion to the total. We've got very strong programs at all three home centers. We invest a lot in product development, in innovation, in training. And so there is a consistency to that business that we approach it with. We take a very straightforward, profitable growth type mindset to it and we try to partner with each of the home centers and say we'd like to expand your offering, we'd like to introduce new product extensions, and we want to provide a lot of service and reliability to you. It's a really good partnership with all three of them and we like that business. That's just running as a constant through the system. ","From time-to-time one of the other of our competitors will for a short period of time surge on promotions. Our consistency and the way we're approaching this says we're not going to follow them on that. We'll let it return back to normal and so therefore there is a proportion there is a share, there is a market share of that that we like to have. And that's a good profitable attractive business. And those home center partners enjoy having us in there as well.","So I contrast that with on the builder side of the market and builder direct, there was a lot of cost over the years that had been added to that segment because of the level support that we needed to provide to builders to be able to support them with direct programs, which is designer services, which is installation services, and it spread across the entire country, which meant we had a lot of infrastructure required to support that business, dedicated specifically to that channel. We took a step back three years ago, even longer, really, just imagine three years ago, say we can\u2019t really support on the margin structure of that business, all that infrastructure. And so we simultaneously took out some infrastructure as well as then we couldn\u2019t support that business and so exited. It kept infrastructure in place, margin structure was better and since restructuring that business we\u2019ve been growing in the east. It's East of the Mississippi, so it isn\u2019t just East Coast and that\u2019s very nice profitable business. So it has to do with the composition of how you service that business and the competitive environment around that. And so that\u2019s the difference between those two.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Brian Lantz for closing remarks.","Brian Lantz","Thank you, everybody.

Following their prepared remarks, we have allowed some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. In the first quarter, our performance was on plan in the U.S. and Canadian housing market that started the year slowly, as we expected. We had anticipated some weakness in the first half, given the slower momentum at the end of last year and we executed well in a softer market, by positioning our businesses appropriately and managing them tightly.","At our February 6 Investor Day, we outlined a set of actions we were taking across the company to address market and industry challenges and increase exposure to the more stable and predictable segments of our markets, all in the backdrop of more moderate market growth.","Through the first quarter, both the market and our performance have been consistent with what we laid out in February. We're making solid progress on the business plans we communicated, including in Cabinets and Security and we're focused on consistent execution, even in periods of slower growth. Although, much work remains ahead and the market overall is likely to remain soft through the first half, I'm very pleased with the start of the year across our businesses.","Let me first take you through our view of the U.S. home products market. Next, I'll provide my perspective on our business performance in the first quarter. Pat will then provide more details on our first quarter performance and 2019 outlook.","Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the first quarter, the market for our home products was softer and grew at the pace we planned, about 2% to 2.5%. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew around 4% and that new construction spending on our product categories was down low single digits.","We continue to expect the second quarter market to be soft. However, the pace is beginning to pick up here in April and we expect to see demand improve month-over-month. Orders are trending positively and the fundamentals that drive housing and R&R demand are improving.","Mortgage rates have fallen below where we thought they might be. New and existing housing price increases have moderated. The economy is slightly better than we thought and the recession does not appear imminent. There appears to be progress on trade discussions and consumer confidence is improving. All-in-all, we're more comfortable with our February assumptions regarding a modest acceleration of growth in the second half of 2019.","Now, let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the first quarter, sales increased 6% in total. On the top line, we performed well across the company and grew on an organic basis, ahead of a market that was low single digits in the quarter.","Total company operating margin came in 80 basis points above last year, at 10.7%. We delivered on our margin expectations, as we continued to be aggressive with our cost management and supply chain actions. In addition to these cost actions, our pricing actions last year recovered tariff and other inflation throughout the second half of 2018 and into the first quarter.","Now turning to the segments, beginning with Plumbing. Sales were up 2% for the quarter and up 3.5%, excluding FX. Our Plumbing business achieved its plan on sales and margin, as we saw continued strong growth in China and growth in our U.S. business was as expected. Charter growth continues to outpace the market as we expanded our presence into whole room solutions and our strong execution across this broader portfolio of products is driving share gains.","In the U.S., wholesale of POS ran ahead of sales and inventories are running lean, as our channel partners continued with a conservative approach in the first quarter. This trend is not surprising and has the potential to act as a tailwind and improve our second half, in line with our expectations.","The gradually improving market, coupled with this team's pace of product innovation and channel expansion, gives us confidence that the Plumbing team remains on track and is positioned to accelerate growth in the second half.","In our Doors & Security segment, sales were up 20% and 5%, excluding Fiberon. In this group Doors continued to perform well in a softer new construction environment, with Door sales increasing high single digits on the back of strength in retail, as the wholesale channel saw some destocking with the weaker new construction market.","In decking, we've been rapidly integrating the Fiberon acquisition and accelerating investments there ahead of plan, to achieve targeted growth opportunities that will begin to be realized in the second half of the year and into 2020 and beyond. And in Security products, we improved operating performance and grew sales low single digits, while improving margins versus prior year.","Overall, the Doors & Security segment is tracking to plan on sales and profits. The segment will reflect some increased seasonality in its quarterly profit profile, associated with the decking business of Fiberon. Additionally, we have been investing in capacity and innovation in Doors and Fiberon to sustain above-market growth rates and realize new opportunities.","Our integration effort with Fiberon is progressing well and we're investing in product line expansion and capacity ahead of a range of new opportunities that will begin to be realized later this year and into the following years. We look forward to updating you on our exciting progress in the recently formed Doors & Security segment as we move through the year.","In Cabinets, our team achieved 3% sales growth in the first quarter, which marked the reversal from the negative sales trends we saw all of last year. The team also delivered 350 basis points of margin improvement, which is slightly ahead of our expectations.","Our performance was a solid start to the year and is clear evidence of the concrete progress of our pivot plan. As we continue to align our product lines and capacity toward growth opportunities, demand for simpler bath and kitchen remodel projects continues and sales of value products remain strong. Both of these are signs that we are on the right track strategically in terms of where we are pivoting our Cabinet business.","As I look at value-priced cabinets broadly across home center, dealer and builder-direct, in the first quarter we saw home center in-stock cabinets and vanities continuing to grow above market; online and e-commerce business that is accelerating within this price point; stock products offered through our dealer network expanding; our targeted builder business taking share in most parts of the country where we compete; and lastly, our decorative laminate veneer product winning across the board and taking share in builder-direct and other new construction-facing channels. Margins continuing to be very good in value cabinetry in the low teens, as we leverage Mexico and automate and streamline more facilities in the U.S.","Turning to semi-custom in Canada. The market and our business growth remained challenged in the first quarter. However, we are aggressively restructuring capacity and supply chains and driving pricing actions to continue to improve profitability in this part of the market.","Over the course of the past year and continuing into this year, we have taken a number of actions, including rightsizing our capacity, eliminating several plants and reducing fixed costs broadly throughout the segment, standardizing product lines to further leverage our global procurement and Mexican component manufacturing and investing in automated finishing.","Work in these areas will continue throughout 2019 and despite our first quarter cabinet market that was soft overall as forecast, we continue to make good progress on our pivot plan and target those parts of this market that continue to grow.","As a reminder, we're executing our pivot plan, as we believe that over time the scale of our logistics advantaged and low-cost Mexican production platform combined with our distributed assembly and industry-leading made-to-order facilities in the U.S. will be competitively advantaged in the marketplace versus both import and domestic competition.","These actions reflect not only our longer-term view on the, industry but also position us well for the next three to four years of profit improvement and growth. The shifts we are making increase our exposure to the more stable and predictable parts of the cabinet market and at higher margins than we enjoy today.","So to recap the quarter. Our performance was on plan in a market that started out slowly as we expected. Our Plumbing business delivered on its planned sales and margin and our Cabinet pivot is showing more visible signs of progress. Our Security business is back on track and we're making some investments into our new Fiberon platform to capture some exciting growth opportunities that will unfold later this year and into the next several years.","Our teams did an excellent job of growing overall sales and margin in the soft market and in the quarter where our channel partners continued to manage inventory conservatively. Despite these planned headwinds, we remain on track for the year. So based on how things are progressing, we feel more confident in our assumptions regarding modest second half expansion.","While it is too early to update our full year outlook, I am more confident in the progress we have made in Cabinets and Security, which were two areas with more uncertainty as we exited last year and in our general ability to execute in the softer market. Given the housing market volatility over the past few quarters, we are maintaining our current sales and EPS outlooks, but we'll further revisit our outlook on our second quarter call after assessing the key spring and early summer selling seasons.","Before I wrap up, let me return to our capital deployment in the quarter and our broader plan to create long-term incremental value. Year-to-date through April, we have spent $50 million on share repurchases for about 1.1 million shares. We plan to continue to use share repurchase opportunistically as a vehicle to generate attractive returns consistent with prior practice. We also continue to evaluate a pipeline of potential acquisitions.","Using our strong cash flow and balance sheets, we have the capacity and flexibly to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase additional shares and increase our dividend to create meaningful incremental shareholder value, while still deleveraging naturally throughout the year. As a reminder, over the next three years, we continue to believe we have the potential to deploy an additional $3 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Pat who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our outlook for 2019.","Pat Hallinan","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our first quarter results.","Sales were $1.3 billion, up 6% from a year ago 3% organically. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $142 million, up 14% or $18 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 10.7%, 80 basis points higher than last year. We remain on track to achieve our goal of around 50 basis points of operating margin improvement for the full year.","EPS were $0.63 for the quarter versus $0.56 the same quarter last year, an increase of 13%. EPS met our expectations. We are pleased by our team's ability to grow sales and earnings during a period of slower market growth and with the persistence of a challenging trade environment.","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the first quarter were $459 million, up $9 million or 2%. Excluding currency, sales were up 3.5% in the quarter, which was above our expectation given the 16% organic sales growth rate delivered last year. Mid-single-digit U.S. POS and continued strong growth in China drove the quarter with reported sales results muted by unfavorable FX and U.S. and Canada channel inventory reductions.","Plumbing operating income decreased 2% to $91 million. Operating margin was 19.7%, right in line with our plan and consistent with typical first quarter Plumbing operating margins. Last year first quarter Plumbing margin benefited from favorable volume and mix dynamics we did not expect to repeat in 2019. We continue to be on track with our full year outlook in Plumbing with sales up in the mid to high single-digit range and operating margin of around 21%.","Turning to Doors & Security. Sales were $296 million, up $49 million or 20% from the prior year quarter with Fiberon contributing $37 million to a seasonally low quarter for decking. Operating income was lower by $3 million in line with our expectations and driven by expected first quarter investments and other anticipated margin items in particular product innovation and capacity investments in doors and decking for important 2019 and early 2020 growth initiatives.","Purchase accounting amortization during a seasonally light decking quarter and ahead of offsetting synergies, which are tracking as expected. Uniquely strong prior year doors mix associated with a new product launch; and above-average doors operating performance both of which produced a uniquely high first quarter doors operating margin we anticipated would not repeat during the first quarter of 2019.","We remain on track to deliver high-teens sales growth and segment operating margins of around 14% in 2019. Our base Therma-Tru and Master Lock businesses expect organic sales growth in the mid to high single-digit range in 2019. Importantly, security products returned to growth and delivered solid operating performance in the quarter.","Turning to Cabinets. Sales for the first quarter were $573 million, up $16 million or 3% versus the prior year quarter. Sales were positive across most product categories with the especially strong sales of value cabinets as Chris mentioned. Home center special order and Canada were the exceptions and were lower in the first quarter on softer market demand for semi-custom cabinets and a weak overall housing market in the case of Canada.","Operating income in the first quarter was $45 million, up $20 million or 84% versus the prior year. Operating margin was 7.8% or 350 basis points higher year-over-year, an excellent result given the soft market. While we are off to a solid start to the year, our Cabinets pivot is not complete and we are on a journey that targets improvement in half year increments.","For the full-year, we remain on track to deliver 3% to 4% sales growth with around 70 basis points of margin expansion, but we do not expect sales and margin progress to be uniform across quarters. For example, in the second quarter, we are supporting a number of new product introductions into the value part of the market, which while positive overall are likely to slow operating profit growth relative to the first quarter pace and relative to last year, though we expect to deliver double-digit operating margin performance during the second quarter.","For the company to sum up consolidated first quarter performance sales increased 6%, 3% organically and EPS were consistent with our plan at $0.63 demonstrating our ability to execute and drive growth and margin improvement in a slower market. Our total company operating margin was 10.7% or 80 basis points above last year and was led by Cabinets profit improvement, lower corporate costs and tight management of our businesses across the board.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our March 31 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $281 million, net debt of $2.2 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 2.5 times. We also added to our financial flexibility in the quarter by extending the maturity on our term loan to March 2020 at an amount of $350 million and we continue to have the capacity and flexibility to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases as we delever naturally throughout the year and over time.","Year-to-date, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $50 million. Our approach to share repurchase continues to be opportunistic and focused on where we can generate significant returns. We have approximately $364 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2019. As Chris mentioned, we are maintaining our 2019 EPS outlook of $3.53 to $3.77 with the midpoint of $3.65 representing 9% EPS growth versus the prior year. We continue to expect full year sales growth of 6% to 7.5% and organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. While it's too early to update our full year guidance, we are encouraged by the improvement to demand drivers, critical to the U.S. housing market in particular housing affordability, employment and wage growth and by our business performance in particular in Cabinets and Security. The important spring and early summer selling season will inform any guidance update at the end of the second quarter.","As a reminder, and consistent with our initial guidance, we continue to expect first half sales growth of 5% to 6% and first half organic sales growth of 3% to 4% and first half EPS growth of 6% to 7%. This continues to be our first half expectation. We expect 2019 free cash flow of $500 million, with a conversion rate of over 90% and EBITDA of around $950 million consistent with our Investor Day expectations.","The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions interest expense of around $94 million, a tax rate of between 25% and 26% and average fully diluted shares of approximately 142 million.","In summary, we are off to a good start to 2019. Our teams executed well in a slower market, while making significant progress on strategic initiatives. For 2019, we expected a soft start to the first half of the year, with market growth in the 2% to 3% range. We got exactly that and our teams delivered putting us on track to achieve our full year financial targets.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Pat. That concludes our prepared remarks on the first quarter of 2019. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions. Since there maybe a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then re-enter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Justin Speer","Hey, guys. Thank you. Just a very large incremental margin there for the Cabinets in the quarter and can you relay in terms of your pivot strategy the fixed cost savings that you're expecting to extract from that strategy incrementally this year? And then, separately the mix of value versus non-value product today versus last year and the margins of that non-value product?","Chris Klein","Yeah. We don't break out the kind of contribution between those lines. I'd say, the results reflected the combination of a number of things that we've done inside that pivot plan. So as you point out, we took out some significant fixed costs last year, closed two plants and took out some other incremental costs, primarily around the semi-custom part of that market. In turn, we put some capacity into Mexico to support the value side of the business, and so that certainly contributed to some leverage. We also as we talked last year took quite a bit of incremental pricing to offset tariffs in other commodities that we described throughout the year.","And then the mix, I think improved a bit too. So really the combination of those things. From a growth standpoint, clearly the value part of the market the in-stock and value part of the market showed some really nice growth in the quarter. The overall semi-custom and the other part of the market was less robust. Dealer was okay, but as we pointed out the home center semi-custom side of the market was a little soft in Canada as well. So the value side of the market clearly was driving more of the growth. But I'd say improvement across the board and a culmination of a number of things. And this is what we expected. I know it's frustrating where we were last year as we're describing a number of things and actions we were taking and it wasn't all transparent. I think you're going to see a steady cadence of that transparency unfold throughout the year.","Justin Speer","Thank you. My next question just following up on Plumbing from last quarter, I think you mentioned 25% tariffs in your margin mapping, or roughly 80 basis points headwind to the overall business implied in that $45 million headwind from a 25% tariff. How does that affect or how does that change with a 0% tariff? How does that change your mapping if at all in terms of pricing or margin assumptions for 2019?","Pat Hallinan","Yeah. Justin recall when we talked guidance for the year Plumbing and beyond relative to the 25% -- or 25% tariff scenario we stated both at the Investor Day and our earnings call before that, that if that were to emerge, we would offset it with cost initiatives and price kind of dollar for dollar. It wouldn't be a change one way or the other, up or down in our EPS dollars for the year. Now, if 10% tariff dropped off that certainly is beneficial, but beneficial more to 2020 unless it were to happen literally tomorrow, right? I mean, most of those goods are obviously coming from China, where it takes about three months from order to receipt and then about another three months for them to flow to your balance sheet onto your income statement. So any change to tariff that's kind of June or later doesn't really change the income statement for 2019. But just as a reminder, consistent with the guidance we gave out the 10% tariff scenario for fiscal 2019 was about $25 million of inflation for the total business not just Plumbing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Nice start to the year.","Chris Klein","Hey, Tim.","Tim Wojs","Maybe just stepping backwards. Maybe if you can talk a little bit of kind of what you saw around demand as you kind of went into the quarter. And I'm specifically kind of interested in margin how April has kind of shaped up for you?","Chris Klein","Sure. We expected pretty soft quarter overall given that we lagged on the new construction side by a quarter or two. And so everybody saw what happened in the last two quarters of last year. So we knew that would impact that side of the business in the first quarter. But it came in about as expected so a little soft. Not worse, but about where we thought it was.","And on the R&R side still decent demand maybe 3.5%, 4% demand on that side of the market. I think there was \u2013 January was okay. I think you saw as the quarter unfolded a little softness in February. And then as we got to the end of March and early into April business picked up. So here in April over the last couple of weeks, we've seen some more encouraging signs. So I'd say in general, it's as expected. And it unfolded in terms of mix and market dynamic in the way we thought it would.","Tim Wojs","Okay. Okay. And then maybe on Cabinets. Could you talk a little bit about just some of the costs associated with what sounds like some \u2013 I don't know, if it's marketing promotions or some sort of training or things like that around the value product launch? If there's any way to kind of run through what exactly you're doing there and then \u2013 and maybe how much that might be costing you in the second quarter?","Chris Klein","Yeah. In general, we're launching a couple of new products but more significantly there's a product road through dealer that is coming at kind of the simplified part of the market part there, where we've got products today, but this is probably coming in tighter around a limited selection and a sharper price point. So there are some normal launch costs in terms of just supporting that from a sales and training standpoint. So that's kind of going to unfold in the quarter. I'd say the quarter is still going to generate nice margin as Pat illustrated. I mean, you'll still be below teens margins. So \u2013 ","Pat Hallinan","Yeah, it'll be like 11.5 plus or minus 50 basis point margin for the quarter, Tim. And it's the kind of typical startup costs and launch costs associated with the product offering.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. Just the comments you made about demand trends showing some signs of improvement in April, I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color about that. What products, channel, end markets just a little if you could give a little more specific about what specifically you were seeing in April in terms of improving demand trends?","Chris Klein","Sure. I think in the context of a pretty soft first quarter exited March and early April, and I think the overall activity that we observed on the Cabinets side as we looked at shopper behavior and traffic overall quote activity through our dealers, which we have proprietary insight into through our bigger dealer network, and then orders beginning to pick up off those quotes coming through. We certainly saw the same feedback through our retail partners and some order activity coming through there.","On the builders side not too much, I think we commented that the channels are lean on the wholesale side across Plumbing, across Doors. We expect those may pick up but we haven't seen that activity pick up in anticipation of builder activity. So it's really more just concrete shopping quoting and on the R&R side behavior coming through.","I haven't uttered the word weather yet, and I really hesitate. But I think there are parts of the country where you just saw a lot of shopping activity muted in February and March and maybe opening back up again here as we enter April.","Nishu Sood","Got it, got it. And the destocking or the inventory lightness that you mentioned in wholesale -- in the wholesale channel was that the case in retail as well? And also in terms of the -- some of the destocking activity, would you say that it was roughly in line with the level of demand weakness? Or was it greater than that, and therefore might represent some potential tailwind later in the year?","Chris Klein","So second half of your question first. It was -- POS was running ahead of sales. So there should be some tail wind coming into the second half. Not unexpected. I think the channels are understanding that there will be demand materializing waiting to see it materialize.","The reality is we can respond pretty quickly and so they count on us to respond pretty quickly and we do. And so they're being efficient and so it's not completely unanticipated. But as they see demand starting to pick back up again they'll push through. POS was actually stronger than the sales results that we put out both in Doors and in Plumbing. So that's an encouraging sign.","I'd say in terms of wholesale and retail, more pronounced in wholesale than in retail. I think retail in general -- the general trend in retail has been for them to be managing their channels tighter. So I think that general trend continued. But I'd say the pronounced -- more pronounced was I think -- most exposed to more the builder activity just waiting to see it show up before they push an order button.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Yeah, thanks very much guys. That question regarding the pickup in the business and you haven't seen the restocking manifest itself yet. I just wanted to clarify that that was assumed in your guidance, right and you didn't anticipate that you'll be seeing it that quickly.","And then also assuming that's correct, I was curious if you could talk about the Cabinets business. Specifically you talked about the semi-custom being a little bit weak. Was curious if you think there may be any likelihood that there would be some exiting or reduction of shelf space associated with the higher end of the cabinet array in the home centers.","Chris Klein","Yeah. So I guess, the first question on was this anticipated in our guidance? Yeah, we expected a pretty soft start to the year and we looked at channel positions as we started the year and assumed that given the soft start on new construction, we projected negative new construction activity in the first quarter that there wouldn't be that restocking. So that was anticipated and things unfolded as we thought they would.","In terms of your second question just on the cabinet market overall, I think there is -- we talked about the shift more to value simpler projects. There is still a market there for premium and for that higher-end more complex and costlier project.","And so our dealers still carry those product lines and we still work with designers. That activity is less than it had been but it is still there. And as building picks up and especially in kind of more fluid areas that will still be a business. So we're not exiting those product lines. I'd just say all the activity that we've been about has been balancing our capacity to where we see the demand at. And we're still operating across a huge spectrum of price points from entry-level down sub-$100 all the way up through over $1,000 cabinet box. And we're still operating across there, but we balance our capacity and our cost structure to match where the demand is and we're comfortable that we're positioning that appropriately.","Stephen Kim","Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Last question, I guess on Cabinets again is, obviously, there's been some talk of competitive change in ownership in the cabinets. And I'm curious as to how you look at it at the industry dynamics really over the course of the next couple of years. How do you think that shift in ownership is likely to affect your opportunity set or your strategies that you'll be -- you're employing this year in light of this forthcoming change?","Chris Klein","Because we've been pretty clear eyed in looking at the cabinet industry over the last couple years and have taken a lot of action to control what we can control and we're really encouraged with the progress that we've made there and the results that we're delivering.","And I'm not sure of that ownership change in our competitor is going to impact that. We are confident in what we're doing and the success that we're having and where we're having it and the plan that we've got, and the further actions that we're going to take. And so we feel that we're competitive irrespective of the changes in the dynamics in the industry.","We've taken tough actions and as I said earlier there hasn't been as evidenced last year as they will be this year. So things externally will play out the way they will play out. We'll be competitive against whoever else is in the marketplace, and we feel comfortable with the strategies that we're executing on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Phil Ng","Congratulations on a strong quarter. Particularly on the growth in Cabinets, 3% was pretty solid from our perspective. With this segment potentially seeing more of an uplift with some of the trends you highlighted where things are picking up in recent months particularly on new construction I would imagine, and I believe you have a pretty nice rollout of some new products coming out there, so I'm just curious how the adoption is coming along.","Chris Klein","I think we called for low single-digit growth. That's what we achieved in the first quarter. I think as the year unfolds, you'll certainly get a benefit from some new construction. It will be more back half weighted, which is where we see demand coming at us across the board from new construction. So I think you'll see that benefit us. What we projected for the year assumes soft new construction activity first half and a modest pickup second half and a traditional R&R marketplace. 4%-ish is reasonable, and so that should support that level of activity.","Pat, I don't know if you have any other comment.","Pat Hallinan","I would say, Phil we expect Cabinets for the full year to be in that three-plus percent range. We delivered that in the first quarter. You'll see that be the average across the next three quarters. There'll be ebbs and flows. I think the second quarter will be close to where the first quarter was. The third quarter will be higher with some of the value product launch and the comp dynamics we have versus the third quarter of last year.","And the fourth quarter will be a little bit below that average not because there's anything wrong but just because we had a 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2018. And so that will be the only kind of comp dynamic. But we'll be traveling in that three-plus percent range on average for each of the next three quarters of the year. And it will be led as it has been led by value price point products both those pocket, the home center and those going through the dealer channel and the builder channel. And we're expecting to see continued softness in the mid-price points with semi-custom cabinets in Canada both just because of the market dynamics around semi-custom and the Canadian housing dynamics. And we're working to adjust those cost structures proportionate to those market dynamics.","Phil Ng","Got it. That's great color. And then from a Fiberon perspective, can you provide a little more color how that business performed in the quarter? And it sounds that you're adding some incremental capacity. How much supply could that unlock? And does that provide some opportunity for you to pick up some share or you've already picked up some share?","And just lastly from a capital investment standpoint, I can't imagine this is a big spend but just any color on that front would be helpful.","Chris Klein","Yes. So, Fiberon is going well. Anytime you buy a business and we've bought a number of them, you find good things and then you're surprised with some bad things. And so the good things far outweigh anything else we found.","The team is working hard. We had a set of opportunities that we were targeting and I'd say, I'm not going to give specifics on them, but they're progressing faster than we had even anticipated. And so we're going to ahead making some investments in both some product and some capacity and it's within range. It's not going to really put pressure on our EPS guidance or our capital budget. It's all within the range. But I'd say we're pulling some things forward earlier into the year to allow us to accelerate some of those revenue opportunities that we've got.","That should start to unfold second half of the year and come into 2020. So, everything on track I think from both a revenue and margin standpoint. It's just that we're going to accelerate some things and we're excited and we'll be more transparent about that as they unfold.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hey guys. This is actually Truman Patterson on for Stephen. Just following up on -- hey, just following up on a prior question on Plumbing and tariffs. Have you guys actually altered your supply chain to offset the 10% China tariff? Or have you guys primarily mitigated this through pricing?","And then kind of a second part. Assuming that the tariffs would drop to 0%, you said the benefit would be in kind of 2020. Would that impact your pricing decision? Would you guys try and capture that tailwind and expand your margins? Or would you guys more look to reinvest kind of keep margins capped at 21% to drive additional market share?","Pat Hallinan","Truman in the case of Plumbing, specifically, because all of our businesses are attacking the tariff situation through a combination of cost and price, not just price. And obviously supply chain is part of that formula.","I would say in the case of Plumbing more specifically, it's more cost takeout in areas where we could accelerate it pricing and some cost sharing with vendors more than getting out of China, that's harder to do in Plumbing than it is in some other categories that we have like in Cabinets where we are very much departing China from a wood products perspective. So, there's less retooling of the supply chain and more just changing the cost structure of it and then balancing out price for the remainder.","I would say consistent with what we've been saying, we're going to maintain roughly 21% margin in the Plumbing business to drive above-market growth. And so to the extent we end up with any kind of favorable event, we tend to invest that in innovation of brand and we'll continue to do that whether it's driven by tariffs or something else.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Okay. Thank you guys. Jumping over to your Doors & Security segment. Margin seemed to be a bit more pressured than what we were expecting. I know you guys mentioned some tough comps and individual businesses. Could you maybe break apart the segment and discuss the individual operations? And I know in the back half of 2018 you guys also had some manufacturing issues with the ball bearing locks. Could you give us an update on this?","Pat Hallinan","Yes. So, the hint kind of where you finished your question. Just really clearly our Security business had a really nice first quarter. They returned to growth and they had operating margin improvement versus the prior year and delivered solid operating margin that has them on track to make very significant operating margin improvement for the full year. So, it's good to see and much as we expected our Security business performing again as it has throughout much of its history.","In terms of the whole group, it's what you're referring to of the profit and margin performance of the group. It was really driven by the three items we referenced in our prepared remarks. We have some significant investment in both new product and capacity in both the Doors and the Fiberon decking business for growth initiatives that will be taking place in the latter part of this year and into 2020 and beyond. It's a very exciting growth initiative that we'll talk about more during the latter part of this year.","And then also in the Doors business, specifically last year, they had a very unique comp that was driven by a new product launch in the wholesale part of the business that was very successful and involved a product load-in.","And what you saw last year in the Doors business was a first quarter operating margin that was roughly at 80% of its full year operating margin when it's typical that the Doors first quarter operating margin is usually 50% or less of its full year operating margin.","So, you just have a unique dynamic with the Doors operating performance in the first quarter last year that we knew was not going to repeat this year. And that's why atypically we don't give guidance in anything less than a full year. And that's why we gave enterprise-wide guidance for the first half that have EPS growth in the 6% to 7% range versus the full year of 9%-ish.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Thank you for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to hit on the full year guidance. And in your prepared remarks, you talked about some better than expected trends and encouraged results I think in Cabinets & Security where it was a little bumpy in the past year and in the last couple of quarters in particular.","It seems like if I'm hearing it right that you're holding guidance at this point. Obviously, you said you want to see how the spring and early summer still plays out. But there's definitely it sounds like there's some encouraged results at least in the first quarter.","Just trying to get a sense if those better than expected results or some of those positive turns continue would we expect to see any upside driven by Cabinets & Security? And just trying to get a sense of -- it looks like you reiterated not only your full year EPS guidance, but segment-by-segment where we might see some of that upside. Would it be more in the cabinet topline and margins or a little bit better on the Doors & Security margins? Just trying to get a sense of where the upside might come from given again sort of the positive commentary description around the first quarter.","Chris Klein","Sure. I'd say obviously we exited the year as an industry in a pretty volatile way. And the first quarter we considered would be soft. And I'd say the market overall was pretty soft. As we sit here all those things that drive the market as we look at it are trending positively.","And so we expect that over the next quarter things will improve. We lag the new construction cycle by a quarter or two. So, as it picks up we'll really feel that in the second half of the year.","So, I'd say the best way -- I guess that we've been talking about it is what's unfolded over the last 90 days has increased the probability that we will achieve the guidance we've given. We've obviously given a pretty wide guidance range. So, there's a -- they're at a range above the midpoint.","But at this point let's see how things unfold over the next couple of months before we try to quantify that. I think that's kind of the best way that we thought about it. So, a lot of moving pieces within the marketplace.","And then within our business we're really encouraged by the progress that we've made especially in those parts of the business that there had been a lot of change going on. So, as you say in Security, we corrected some operational issues and that is back on track and operating really well.","In Cabinets you're seeing evidence of everything we've done over the last 18 months. That's operating well. And we did a significant acquisition in Fiberon and that's coming along well.","So, I think you kind of think about those pieces where there's been more significant change and the performance is good. And now if the market continues to unfold the way it looks like it's going to, it's going to be a good year and we'd say consistent with our guidance. But we felt that given the volatility, we want to wait until the next couple of months to unfold before trying to lay that out.","Michael Rehaut","No, I appreciate that obviously. I guess, secondly just going back to Cabinets. You had mentioned that the value cabinets generating low teens margins. But you also have other initiatives in -- with regard to profitability for the other parts of your portfolio. So just trying to get a sense number one, if you think about the next couple of years, and obviously, you're shifting more to that value part of the segment, where would that go as a percentage of your portfolio, let's say, 2019 versus 2021?","As well as with the remaining parts of your portfolio, what type of margin improvement are you trying to drive from a basis-point standpoint? So again, it's kind of a two-parter, but where -- what could your value cabinets be as a percent of your portfolio? Where could that go from what to what over the next couple of years? And what are we talking about in terms of the margin improvement in other parts of the segment?","Pat Hallinan","Yes, Mike. Last year we finished 2018. If you include our new construction products like the Aristokraft brand and the broad range of value products, which is dominated by the cabinets and vanities we sell at home center, but not limited to that it was in the 35% to 40% of our business range at the end of fiscal 2018. It is growing mid to high single digits, right? So it's growing kind of above, I would say, overall U.S. building products market.","Like I said, it's a bit like our Plumbing. It's a project that consumers have a great desire for, so it won't be surprising to us if over the next 24-plus months, it's more than 50% of our business there. We're working to get all of our businesses across that whole portfolio though towards that 13-ish percent operating margin. And we talked about at Investor Day of getting the portfolio to 12.5-plus percent by 2021, and that's still our objective working across the brands to keep driving that.","Operator","And your next question comes from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Chris Klein","Hi.","Susan Maklari","My first question is just can you give us some sense of the inflationary trends that you've seen? How have those changed maybe as we're approaching the second quarter? And how we should be thinking about them maybe relative to some of the pricing initiatives that you've put in across the business?","Pat Hallinan","So we expected at least again take out kind of tariffs from the picture and just clean it up. We expected inflation non-tariff or at least non-301 tariff commodity inflation of roughly $50 million and freight inflation of around $15 million. So think of it as total $65 million of non-301 tariff inflation for the year. And our forecast following the first quarter actual results is virtually right on top of that.","We've had some favorable items like particle board and plywood and freight where we faced a lot of uncertainty, as we were switching vendors in particle board and plywood out of China, a part of that tariff scenario that's not a 301 tariff scenario. And that turned out better than we expected. But copper and zinc had been a bit higher than we have expected.","But I'd say across the portfolio, you're talking inflation that's very much within the balance of our start of the year expectations and we don't see that changing our pricing scenario for the year.","Susan Maklari","Got you. Okay. And then coming into the year with the uncertainty in the operating environment, you kind of have talked to a more cautious or more defensive approach to your capital allocation. You're definitely stepping away from M&A at least for the first half of the year. And now with things maybe appearing to come together a little bit more and a little further into the year here, is there any change to how you're thinking about that? Can you talk a little bit to what you've been seeing in terms of the M&A pipeline? And how we should be thinking about the second half of the year?","Chris Klein","Sure. Yes. I think our caution was really reflective of the M&A marketplace, where we saw it get kind of quiet in the fourth quarter and anticipated that would continue, and it has been kind of quiet really on the part of companies wanting to sell themselves. I think most companies in our sector would have felt the effect of the fourth quarter, the first quarter market and would rather get a couple of good quarters under their belt before they come forward and represent their financials to us.","So I'd say, it was more of the hesitancy on the part of the sellers than on our side. Having said that, we've been engaged in a number of discussions that have been going on for a while. And so those continues I think at the point when companies may be opened to be selling, we haven't stopped talking to a number of opportunities.","All those are within the sectors that we're in, so broadly outdoor living, exterior continue to have a number of discussions in the Plumbing area. And so there's -- yes, I think, I can never project or predict things, but I'd say, if market continues to improve and the results of some of the businesses that may want to sell themselves, improve certainly second half of next year or second half of this year or into next year, you could see some things and I think we'd be prepared to take some action.","Operator","This does conclude our conference call for today.

We're pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress during the fourth quarter of 2017 and provide our 2018 guidance.","Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release issued earlier. The news release and the audio replay of the webcast of this call can be found in the Investors section of our fbhs.com website.","I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements we make on the call today, either in our prepared remarks or in the associated question-and-answer session, are based on current expectations and our market outlook and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated.

Any references to operating income, earnings per share or cash flow on today's call will focus on our results on a before charges and gains basis for continuing operations, with the exception of cash flow, unless otherwise specified.","With me on the call today are Chris Klein, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pat Hallinan, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, sales growth accelerated across our businesses and it was led by Plumbing. Demand for our Home & Security products continues to be solid and our teams again drove strong operating margins across all segments.","For the full year, we continue to execute on our strategy of disciplined profitable growth as we increase earnings per share double digits. Sales grew 6% and our operating margins increased to 13.7%. Our teams again grew sales and margins simultaneously. The margin improvement delivered during 2017 keeps us squarely on track to achieve 15% operating margins when the housing market returns to steady state levels over the next few years.","In addition, we delivered incremental growth during the year, we spent a 140 million on the two plumbing acquisitions of Shaws of England and Victoria and Albert. We purchased $215 million of our shares and again increased our quarterly dividend. All in all our teams have continued to execute at a high level against our strategy and we are performing well in the market that continues to recover gradually. Our product and brand positioning remains strong and the momentum we have built sets us up for continued success in 2018.","Let me first take you through our fourth quarter results and my thoughts on our full year performance in 2017. Then I will discuss our view of the U.S. home products market, our 2018 outlook for sales and EPS growth, and our thoughts on capital allocation. And finally, I'll share a view on the impact of the recently passed tax reform legislation on our company. Beginning with the quarter, overall sales increased to 6% with some storm-related weakness in October transitioning to strength as we moved into November and December. Operating margin performance was solid increasing to 13.5% with margin expanding across our home segments.","Turning first to the plumbing segment, plumbing sales were 10% in the quarter and with organic growth of 9% we continue to outpace the market. This was an especially strong performance against our 19% growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year. The growth was driven by broad based strength in our core markets as consumers responded to our new marketing and accelerated pace of product innovation, strength in new adjacent categories including disposals in all of our markets and sanitary ware in China, and the successful integration and performance of the four acquisitions that were completed over the last 18 months.","As a reminder, the Global Plumbing Group was formed in the summer of 2016 and the strategy began to prove itself throughout 2017. The power of this platform to create value through accelerating organic growth and expanding incremental growth is already starting to show. The Fuller product and brand portfolio, we now offer in plumbing combined with our well established distribution strength and leverage across North America and China is taking hold.","We're driving growth in new and existing sales channels including showrooms, hospitality and online, and the new team structures accelerated growth in our core mowing business as well. On the backend, we're leveraging share procurement, engineering, product development and overhead to drive efficiency and cost savings. In short, the GPG has delivered on our high expectations in the first 18 months. Going forward, we'll continue to enhance our capabilities, products and talents while remaining active in looking for incremental acquisition of partnership opportunities. Importantly, we continue to believe we are on track to reach 2.5 billion in plumbing sales by 2020.","Turning next to Doors, sales were up 6% for the quarter. The doors team delivered another quarter of strong performance and overcame the headwinds associated with severe weather early in the quarter. Wholesale growth was driven by share gains and new construction where the furniture brand continues to resonate in large home builders and industry leading door distributors. Retail door sales also continued to be a terrific story in the quarter.","Our new product and display investments have resulted in sustained share gains and additional store placements. As a result, retail sales have come in above expectations throughout 2017 just by significant inventory placements associated with new product launches in the prior year. We have strong momentum in doors moving to 2018 and plan to invest more in this business, which Pat will discuss in a little more detail there.","In the Security segment, sales increased 4% for the quarter. High single digit increases in Master Lock U.S. retail and double digit increases in safety and international drove the growth and offset the exit of a commercial product line we announced last quarter. Safe sales were also up double digits in the quarter as we\u2019re less constrained by our own capacity following the successful integration of our SentrySafe manufacturing facility.","Security business continues to post strong operating margin overall driven by the manufacturing consolidation and an improving mix. As we move forward, we see enhanced opportunity in 2018 to increase sales across commercial, retail and international markets with continued margin improvement.","For our Cabinet segment, sales were up 4% in the quarter, slightly above the cabinet market which we believe is currently growing at about 3% overall. Similar to recent quarters, sales of in-stock cabinets and vanities were stronger than the overall market, growing low double-digit as we continue to gain share with our product innovation and our sophisticated supply chain and logistics models that support the unique needs of the largest home centers. This part of market also benefits from low project complexity and strong value for price product lines.","Sales in our largest channel dealer were up low single digit in the quarter. Our new construction lines performed well and the premium into the market was positive again, reversing negative trends we saw earlier in the year. The middle of the market remains sluggish and our dealers continue to face constraints in their access to enough installers in many markets around the country.","The balance of our cabinets business which includes builder direct, home centers special order in Canada grew mid single digit. Strong new construction demand in builder direct drove solid growth in the quarter and builder sales increased to high single digit. Builder direct business continues to generate strong sales and margin growth, as we continue to be precise in terms of where we focus, we are evaluating spending our footprint into areas where we can achieve profitable growth.","Canada was down low single-digit, but up low single digit when adjusting for some exited business. Looking past the quarter, our overall cabinets business, it's clearly we have some parts of the business that are performing very well. These include simpler project offering at lower price points across our in-stock cabinet and vanity lines as well as higher price points in custom lines and dealer where we continue to invest in innovation, customer service and technology. And larger contractor remodelers are having more success securing trade labor.","The new construction builder market also remains robust across both builder direct and through our dealers. However, some parts of the cabinet market remained softer, notably the middle of markets semi-custom cabinet business continues to be constrained in many places across channels. As we have done in the past, we are addressing these market opportunities and constraints ahead on. We are making targeted capital investments in parts of the cabinet market that are growing to increase capacity, innovation and service to support to growth.","In the middle of market semi-custom, we are taking things up and allocating our capacity against our best dealer in home center opportunities as we go deeper with important customer in markets that are grown and had labor available. On the margin, we will also backing away from targeted pieces of less attractive business to help us to continue to improve our mix from a margin and growth perspective. We have also initiated some pricing actions to offset tariffs with commodity labor inflation. We will see the benefit of these actions as the year unfolds.","So overall for cabinets, sales growth in the quarter was solid and slightly above the market and at good margins. As we look forward, we see growth in 2018 for our cabinets business in the mid single digit, inclusive of the market dynamics we see, share gains we are experiencing and select exits of U.S. and Canadian business that is also attractive to us going forward. Margins were also continued to expand as pricing actions began to cover inflation and we actively allocate our capacity and product innovation toward our most attractive opportunities.","Turning to the full year, in 2017, we executed well against our strategy of profitable growth. We delivered solid sales, earnings and margin results that continue to reflect health consumer demand for our Home & Security products and our continued commitment to disciplined profitable growth. It's also a strong performance in the face of continued labor constraints the return to an inflationary environment, severe hurricanes and uncertainty on trade and tax policy throughout much of the year.","In the full-year 2017, we grew sale by 6%, earnings by double-digits and increased the total company operating margin to 13.7%. Importantly, inside of each business, we made significant progress on our strategies to enhance our sustainable competitive advantages and achieve profitable growth. In plumbing, we proved out our GPG strategy and added to the power of the platform to drive accelerated organic and incremental growth, while maintaining the strong operating margins for this segment.","In doors, our share gain performance gave us a broader platform to build upon and our 2018 plan now includes significant investments to accelerate growth further. Our doors business produced solid operating margin improvement during 2017 rising by over a 150 basis points and we expect the continued solid margin improvement in 2018.","In security, our core business grew solid mid-single digits and full-year operating margin improved to nearly 15%. We have additional growth opportunities with new product introductions across our markets. And in cabinets, we stay disciplined and focused on profitable growth while navigating a heavier promotional environment, continued trade labor constraints and new plywood tariff and elevated demand from low price points and simpler projects.","With our focused strategic approach, we continue to grow sales and profit despite the challenging market backdrop and some changes in mix, and we remain committed to leveraging our industry leadership.","Now let me turn to our full-year outlook for 2018, starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. Our 2018 annual outlook has built on an assumption that U.S. home products market which impacts roughly 75% of our sales grows at a 5% to 7% rate similar to last year's market growth with favorable housing market demand drivers and demographics. Within that overall assumption, we anticipate that the pace of repair and model demand in 2018 grows at a rate of 5% similar to 2017.","New home construction is assumed to grow at high-single digits in 2018. Single family is expected to continue to grow faster than multifamily and single family entry level activities expected to remain strong. Our total global market which includes assumptions for the U.S. market as well as other international and security markets is expected to grow at a combined 5% to 6% for 2018. Based on that total global market assumption continued, share gains plus our recent funding acquisitions, we expect solid top line growth for 2018 with our full-year sales increasing 6% to 7% over 2017.","With this markets sales growth, our teams are focused on delivering full-year EPS before charges and gains in the range of $3.54 to $3.66 which includes the favorable impact of tax reform. So overall our 2018 outlook is based on reasonable market growth assumptions based on the basket of indicators we amount there. We will continue to execute on our growth strategy and I feel good about the winning momentum that are teams are carrying into the year.","On top of improving sales and earnings organically across our portfolio, we also deployed capital in value creating ways in 2017 as we completed the two plumbing acquisitions. We purchased shares and again increased our quarterly dividend. We continue to focus on creating meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong free cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders.","Our acquisition pipeline continues to be robust and remain encouraged by the number of things we are working on. While there was a brief pause in the fourth quarter as many parties awaited the potential implications of tax reform, the decks are not clear and many situations are becoming more active. Some opportunities we're evaluating are tuck-ins and some are of more significant size. We are looking for long term opportunities that make sense strategically. As a reminder since our 2011 spin-off, we've deployed $1.5 billion on eight acquisitions over the past five years. Over the next three years, we continue to believe we've the potential to deploy more than $3 billion to drive this incremental growth in shareholder value.","Before I turn the call over to Pat, I wanted to talk about the recently passed tax legislation and its impact on our business. We're excited about the new tax legislation. At a high level, it reinforces the advantages of being a big U.S. manufacturer with the large percentage of domestic sales. We're clear winners as a result of the changes and are better positioned now then we were six weeks ago.","Large homebuilders are also now better off and U.S. consumer will see more disposable income providing an increasingly healthy backdrop to the U.S. housing market. And so I do not see the new tax rules that specifically relate to housing and real estate is being a headwind. Instead, I see an opportunity for incremental top line growth due to the strength of underlying demand in an environment which just became more favorable.","Regarding our tax rate, the recently passed tax legislation was positive and going forward the benefit should be significantly favorable. Our estimated 2018 effective tax rate will be between 24% and 26% all in, as a result a good portion of lower U.S. federal tax rate will flow directly to our bottom line. We now have more money to work with and tax incentives continue to invest in our already sizeable U.S. manufacturing and employee base.","Since the housing recovery began, our company has created over 4,000 jobs in the USA over 80% of them in manufacturing, plants and distribution centers across the country. We will continue to invest in capital and people to drive growth, including property plant equipment, technology and an accelerated pace of new product innovation, which should help us drive long term growth in the business while generating even more free cash flow.","To sum up, tax reform is a significant positive that will enable us to continue creating growth opportunities and deploy additional capital to drive long term shareholder value. We look forward to leveraging our improved position to sell even more products in the most exciting housing market in the world.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Pat, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our guidance.","Pat Hallinan","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon. As Brian mentioned to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gain from continuing operations.","Let me start with our fourth quarter results, sales were 1.4 billion up 6% from the year ago despite labor constraints which continued to impact the rate of U.S home products growth and a soft October due to hurricane. Organic sales grew 6%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was 187 million up 14 million or 8% compared to the same quarter last year.","Consolidated operating margin improved 20 basis points to 13.5%. EPS was $0.80 for the quarter versus $0.71 for the same quarter last year increasing 13% and was at the upper end of our guidance range. For the full year 2017, EPS was $3.08 versus $2.75 last year increasing $0.33 or 12% and came in well above our initial guidance at the start of the year which called for $3 and full year EPS at the midpoint.","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our plumbing sales for the fourth quarter were $469 million up 43 million or 10% driven by strength across most of our businesses and geographies including a strong finish from the companies acquired during 2016. Organic sales increased 9%. Operating income increased 10 million to 97 million, up 11%. Operating margins for the segment was 20.8%. For the full year, plumbing sales of over a 1.7 billion increased a 186 million or 12%.","Operating income of 371 million was up 39 million or 12% over the prior year. Operating margin was 21.6%. Our new global plumbing group is delivering on our strategy of growing sales above market while maintaining an operating margin around 21%. In 2018, we expect plumbing sales to go high single digits, and for the plumbing group continues to target operating margins around 21%.","Turning to doors, sales were a 129 million up 7 million or 6% from the prior year quarter. Sales were up at all channels and operating income increased 3 million to 19 million up 15%. Operating margin was 14.5% for the quarter up a 120 basis points. For the full year, doors sales increased 6% to 503 million. Operating income grew 20% to 75 million and operating margin increased 160 basis points to 14.8%.","For 2018, we expect door sales growth to be in the high single digit to low double digit range as we invest in additional retail expansion and in new products to drive growth. Operating margin in our doors business next year is expected to be well above 15%. 2018 leverage will be below that of the last few years as we invest further in retail expansion and new product development.","For security, sales were a 159 million in the fourth quarter up 6 million or 4% versus the prior year. Segment operating income of 24 million was flat and operating margin was 15%. The flat operating income reflects the impact of material inflation. We expect pricing actions to offset material inflation during 2018.","For the full year security sales increased 2% to 593 million, operating income increased 8% from the prior year to 88 million and operating margins was up roughly 80 basis points to 14.9%. Strength in our core business drove the strong operating results as core sales grew 5% offsetting a commercial product line exit. We expect the performance of our core remains strong throughout 2018.","In 2018, we expect security sales growth to be in the mid single digits range as we capture additional top line opportunities in safe and leverage sales momentum in commercial and international. Operating margin in the security business next year is expected to be over 16%. We expect price to offset commodity inflation and mix in operating improvement to drive margin expansion.","Turning to cabinet, sales were 626 million up 25 million or 4% versus the prior year quarter. Sales were up in all channels excluding Canada which declined slightly driven by the strategic exit and business are focusing we discussed on prior earnings call. Dealer sales up 303 million were up 1% from the prior year. Sales of stock cabinets used and new construction were up mid single digit and sales of premium cabinet maintained stable low single digit growth. Both showed promising strength at year end.","Softness in semi-custom cabinets limited dealer growth in the quarter. Sales of in stock cabinets and vanities of 143 million increased low double digits, driven by strong home center POS and share gains, R&R projects requiring relatively low labor intensity such as those involving in stock cabinets, we continue to experience strong demand. Strong demand and low labor intensity higher affordability product is a trend we see across our businesses and expect to continue.","Sales in home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada of 180 million were up 4%. Those are direct sales increased high single digit to despite the team holding some orders in the quarter as builder is still behind due to labor. Home center semi-custom grew low single digit and Canada declined low single digit, despite the decline we focused business in Canada continues to show progress as sales grew low single digit after adjusting for exited business.","Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased 3 million to 67 million or 5% over the prior year quarter with operating margin increasing 10 basis points to 10.7%. Slower than anticipated dealer growth in semi-customs and inflation relative to price constrained fourth quarter and second half margin expansion. During 2018 pricing actions and capacity re-bouncing will reaccelerate margin expansion. Pricing actions have already been implemented in most segments of our cabinet business. Also our disciplined approach to promotion will be tightened further 2018 to be consistent with demand trend and the inflationary environment.","For the full year, cabinet sales of 2.5 billion increased 69 million or 3% over the prior year and operating income grew 5% to 272 million. Operating margin increased 20 basis points to 11%. While our 2017 margin expansion was less than anticipated the team did a good job navigating a challenging market environment and continues to leave the cabinet and industry in terms of ability to grow sales and deliver strong operating margin performance.","In cabinet, we anticipate improved sales growth and operating margin expansion during 2018, driven by strong pricing and promotion discipline, capacity management and continued improvement in the dealer sales. We expect cabinet sales to grow mid single digit in 2018 with operating margin improvement of more than 50 basis points.","To sum up consolidated fourth quarter performance, sales increased 6% and EPS were at the upper end of our range $0.80. Our total company operating margin was 13.5%. For the full year 2017 sales increased 6% and EPS grew 12% to 308. Total company operating margin was 13.7% a 50 basis point improvement and our full-year operating leverage excluding acquisitions was 27%. We are well on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margins when the housing market returns to steady state levels.","Turning now to capital deployment, during 2017 we repurchased 215 million in shares including 39 million during the fourth quarter we spent approximately a 140 million on plumbing acquisition and approximately a 110 million on dividends and increase the 2018 dividend rate. 2017 free cash flow was 464 million were reflecting a conversion rate of almost a 100%.","Even after meaningful capital deployment in 2017, our December 31st balance sheet remains solid. Cash was 323 million, that was 1.5 billion and our net-debt-to-EBITDA leverage it was 1.4 times. Additionally, we have significant capacity under our revolving credit facility to continue to deploy capital to drive incremental growth.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2018, based on our projected 5% to 7% U.S. Home products market growth and our total global market growth of 5% to 6% as well as continued share gains in our areas of strategic focus, we expect full-year 2018 sales to increase 6% to 7% compared to 2017. Our resulting outlook for 2018 EPS are in the range of $3.54 to $3.66. The midpoint of our EPS outlook reflects an increase of 17%.","The impact of tax reform on 2017 was nominal and the go forward benefit of tax reform to our business is significant due to the sizeable reduction on our effective tax rate. The annual 2018 EPS outlook includes the follow-on assumption. Interest expense of around 55 million, a tax rate between 24% and 26% and average fully diluted shares of approximately 155 million. In summary fourth quarter and full-year EPS have strong growth.","With solid performance of our business for the year the momentum we have created and with the global plumbing group and the expected continuing market recovery give us confidence and continued solid growth for the coming years. Importantly the 50 basis points operating margin increase in 2017 and another 50 basis points margin improvement expected in 2018 places on track to achieve our long-term operating margin targets.","Also as demonstrated by the continuing plumbing acquisitions share repurchases and the dividend rate increase, we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value. And our credit facility agreement provides significant flexibility to continue to drive incremental shareholder value.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks Pat. That concludes our prepared remarks on the fourth quarter of 2017 and our full-year 2018 outlook. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","First question I had was just on the broader macro outlook and as always very helpful to get your views on, as you stated previously, how you expect the different end markets to grow in 2018. But I was hoping to get a little bit more detail in terms of what you're seeing in the U.S.? And what drives some of the confidence around some of the -- and specifically the U.S. housing market? How things have been -- you've mentioned the cadence in 4Q and how it's improved during the quarter, perhaps off some of the hurricane challenges. But in general as you look at 2018, where do you see relative areas of strength across your different businesses? And potentially where could you see some areas of upside?","Chris Klein","Yes, we track a lot of variables in the market and the things that we're tracking and looking almost informally point positive. We did start the quarter in October still softer, especially down south and in Texas off the storms. We did -- we felt that the cadence of the business in October wasn't quite where it would have normally been. It picked up November, December, December especially finished strong. You never know December historically is kind of a quiet month. But there was backed up demand flowing through December.","If I look across all of these were tracking, GDP, unemployment, consumer settlements, housing mission data, home ownership rates, rolling 90 days of orders, permits and starts, housing inventory both new construction and existing housing start inventory, quite good, affordability remains good, interest rates are ticking. But in a spectrum of overall affordability where you've got disposable income rising as wages are going up, tax cuts will benefit, disposable income, the affordability metrics if you look at are good, R&R dynamics are positive.","I think historically it's availability of remodel includes to do -- there's much work as there is demand for it, I'll talk about that in a minute but there's strong demand out there, our kitchen bath dealers report a lot of traffic, except when the snow is falling and the storms are going on, and the showrooms were busy, kitchen best show was busy as well. And there's a little bit of tailwind coming in off of the storms, kind of like Hurricane Sandy we could have put our finger on but it was a little bit stronger at the East Coast throughout the year.","And as we started to see that at the back half of the year, I think we'll see it in the first half of this year, so all that points toward a lot of demand, the real constraint in the market is labor, and the labor out in the market, we're looking at labor in terms of our plants, our ability to manufacture the products as we sell. Labor in the end market skilled traded especially carpenters, installers, it's just there's a tight pull in, and so jobs are getting sequenced as the construction take a little bit backed up.","But projects are there and demand is there, just how does it flow, to the extent we have, pretty good weather first part of the year, we'll see a lot of that continue to flow through. And then the other thing we're tracking obviously is inflation, both input cost inflation, wage inflations but then also gives you some pricing power of the market, and so that's what I am watching in general. But that's the byproduct of the strength that we're seeing overall. Even the tax cuts on top and for us it's a really good thing.","You know, currently the fighting phase off to be the big U.S. manufacturer with over 75% of our sales in the U.S., maybe we got a little tailwind finally after spending the last nine years in this recovery kind of fighting it off. Now, we got a little bit of breather back which feels good. So I think we're positive coming year. And then across our businesses, I think we're going to see it unfolding in the end markets. Our two biggest business, plumbing and cabinets, is really seeing strong demand coming in. Doors, some great share gains there and in security numbers not to miss.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks for that Chris, I mean it\u2019s a great answer and certainly I agree with you know some tailwinds supporting continued solid repair model growth with perhaps the tax reform adding a little bit to that. And I know that\u2019s in for some people little bit of contrast of concerns of you know repair model demand slowing as the cycle progresses. So I appreciate that. I guess second question shifting towards from the top line part of the equation to the margin part of the equation. You know you mentioned in your guidance incorporating about a 50 bps margin expansion in '18, similar to the 50 bps you experienced in '17. You know when you kind of look at from the incremental margin, consolidated incremental margin standpoint, you're now a couple of years in a row, if you blend again on a consolidated basis. Looking in more closer to like the low 20s of an incremental margin versus kind of a banner year in 2016 when you almost hit 30%, and of course that was coming off of some investments that you're making in the prior couple of years. So, my question is, how should we think about incremental margins over the next couple of years? I think is it fair to say that in '18 you have a little bit of a catch up with some of the pricing actions and some of the you know offsetting some inflation that you start to experience in the back half of '17? Should we still think about a mid 20s type of incremental margin as the norm, maybe you could help us kind of think through you know the plusses and minuses of the -- of what's helping or hurting the margins in '18?","Chris Klein","Mike, you should expect 25 plus percent incremental margin and I think if you adjust for acquisitions you'll see that. But I step us back to, we feel like we're probably on track for 15% when the housing market is at 1.5 million starts. We would see is kind of the 2020ish or thereabout timeframe, and we're marching towards that at 60 plus bps a year. If you look at '17 and you were adjusted for acquisitions, you get about a 27% incremental margin.","Year 16 was considerably higher and '16 benefited from deflation that '17 did not benefit from. And '18 the first half of '18 we'll be taking price, prices will be flowing into various channels over the first half as though the margins of the second half will be found in the back half, but again if you look at '18 and again you get to the end of the year you are just for inflation you should be seeing leverage of 25 plus percent.","So we feel like we are on track for that 15 percentage steady state. We are still tracking incremental margin at 25% plus. There will be timing lag price to commodity or absorbing the early stages of acquisitions where you could be off that cadence by a little bit, but we still feel like we are broadly on track with where we have been heading.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Rednor","Chris, I wanted to maybe have you talk a little bit more about the cabinet strategy I mean to the prior question on incremental. It seems to be focused on that segment where you're expecting more margin expansion in 4Q. And you got a lot of different things going on as you look to '18. So I think this is the business that you set the stage to get back to 14% 15% margins in two to three years. Just want to hear kind of what's the strategy to get there, now that it seems like there might be a different path?","Chris Klein","Yes, I'd say. Second half of the year, we saw a couple of things going on obviously input cost rose. So we started pricing and actions in the fourth quarter, carrying through the first half of this year. It will take a while to work through system. It's both pricing and reduction on promotion where the least aggressive of those promoting, but we are going to pull back even bit tighter. And then there is mix, the parts of the market are a little challenged in the mid market, semi-custom. They are flattish. It's not significant negative like we saw in the premium end of the market probably 18 months ago, probably three months ago.","But that mix part in the middle was a lot weaker than what we had anticipated. So, as we move in '18, pricing action will be a part of it. The other piece of it is allocating our capacity into those more attractive parts in the market and focusing on those customers and those segments that have given a stronger margin. These parts of the centers on the home -- parts of the centers on the home centers, the two largest home centers actually doing quite well, kind of looking aggregate across their in stock cabinet, vanities and especially order business. The third largest home center has been struggling and actually had pretty weak 17 in cabinet.","And so we are backing away from them and we are really redirecting and going harder at the two largest home centers as well as going deeper in dealer. We are expanding our dealer base. We had a number of terrific companies in 2017 to cheer away from some of our competitors and we are going deeper into that business. And so that pivot moves you toward a regional mix of business in the market. So I would like getting back a few years, we exited builder west because the dynamic of that business was not improving and we allocated capacity to the parts of the builder market that were given us good return and good growth.","And it's the same thing now as we look at that middle part of the market where we are getting good growth. We are getting good growth good margin profile top two home centers. We are getting good growth and profile in dealer and we are going to run hard in those segments. We are big enough we are sitting here across a quarter in the market and every channel every price point that we can direct the business we can direct the flow on what we want and still bring in very good growth but improve that margin profile.","So I mean that is what we've been doing over the last six to seven years we've gone from breakeven up to 1% margin have you exactly what I'm just driving so next step of journey is to continue to focus look at where competitively there is good margin directed business into that harder and backed away from parts of the market where it doesn\u2019t look at the attractive anymore. And our ability to execute that is really unparallel given our signs and scope of our business. So it's more of the same, but in transition you cannot see different effects flowing through the P&L. Is that that clear? Or is I -- there is a lot going on in that statement.","Scott Rednor","No, yes, I think that's the great detail, I guess just from the market perspective. Why do you think the markets I think you mentioned 3% for cash slightly below both your macro indicators and the R&R and new construction side. Is there anything else competitively going on, I was just curious to get maybe your thoughts there?","Chris Klein","The 3% number is market overall, someone would say it's only two. For perspective, our fourth quarter in the U.S. only was about -- we did about 5%. So I take Canada out of our numbers, our cabinet number in the U.S. was about 5% growth, across the market that were saying about three, some would say it's a little bit less than that, it's labor. The demand out there for projects is high. They're backed stuff and if you are going on to our viewer network, we're talking about kind of where is the growth kind of come, it's going to come to those places where they have access to labor where bigger dealers are locking up some labor it's installation and carpenter labor in the market.","So the demand is there, there is a lot of projects in the queue, a lot of designer activity it's just getting it through and into the market. So I'm optimistic about the market overall and I think we're solving this incrementally overtime so I think the owners are better than smaller builders in the market as accessing labor in general. The bigger contractors are having more success from this smaller local price. So it's getting there but it\u2019s working its way through. Home service as well, bigger home service they have more success and access to labor than as I discussed smaller close to that market as well.","So, we will go where the strength is. We'll go where the market is actually able to handle the projects and that's going to give us good growth and good margin. So that's the dynamics kind of one of those by products of tax labor market when you ask I don\u2019t plan where loans were at right now. You don\u2019t have a lot of immigration and immigration typically would have brought in more still trades. We brought in m ore more carpenters, more electricians, masons, plumbers.","So we have got the pool we've got. We're trying to bring some more talent into the industry and were making progress on it, but it's taking the time its taking. Outside of that I'd just say, competitively we're in a very strong place in cabinets. We are winning share. We are winning business. Next time, we can get the flow into the market. The accounts are in there. The penetration of the counters are strong, so I feel good about positioning the business overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari","First I wanted to delve in a little bit more into the weather. I know that you mentioned that you certainly saw maybe some kind of slowdown that came earlier in January as a result of that. Do you think that will sort of cause any kind of a shift in terms of the timing that we see things coming together this quarter?","Chris Klein","It's interesting to say we had some strong rolls through, good chunk of the country, but unlike where we had really bad weather year like 2014 where we kind of had half of the country frozen for six weeks. Most of storm moved through, thawed out a bit, traffic resumed, our plants may have been off a day here or a day there, but got back up again and are recovering. So I am not it will persist. There'll probably be a catch up into February from January volume, but it's nowhere near where we had really bad weather here like hurricane where it's kind of shifted demand into the latter part of the whole year. So I am not as concerned about it as we sit here today, but it's February 1st, so I guess, I shouldn't declare a victory yet, but I think we're okay, I don't know it's just there were a few disruptive weekends, where people stayed home and didn't go to the local home center or kitchen or bath dealer to talk about remodeling their kitchen, they just kind of started the fire and sat back only until the snow melt.","Susan Maklari","And then my second question is and this is kind of bigger picture and thinking further out but if you work across your business and you think about maybe some of the political rhetoric that's coming down, the changes in the taxes, all these things. Do you think over time we could perhaps see more of your offshore competition moving to U.S. base manufacturing? Did that kind of change their cost structure, the competitive dynamics that you face? How do you think about that coming together over time?","Chris Klein","So, a couple of parts to that, I think as big U.S. manufacturer, clearly the tax code, was really written to benefit companies like ours. And so as we sit here today, our cost structure advantage and I think that's a good thing for us, where international competitors should come to the U.S. and set up plants, I think there's a curve on all of that, to come up and attract the labor and to get the process flows and this is the top industry in many places and so the experience we have in manufacturing and some of these sectors is to replicate.","So over time you could see it, I guess the pressure would come on wages bidding up for wage labor, in our marketplace, but for today I actually feel really good, I think as I said here a year ago, I was a bit more concerned about overall trade relations. NAFTA said that there's been any huge breakthroughs, but the tone overall feels a little bit more constructive. So things like NAFTA, China, were not in the period of complete unknown which is what I felt like this time last year.","I think the parameters of where things can wind up are tighter and so we feel pretty comfortable about all of that, so I'd just say for today we feel really good, it's kind of like finally our time has come as a big U.S. manufacturer, we hung in there, we've got over 16,000 people in the U.S., across 87 manufacturing facilities so when you write a tax code that benefits the U.S. manufacturers. We're sitting here in kind of sweet spot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Eisen of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Eisen","I just wanted to start quickly on the GPG and kind of thinking back when you set your targets I think the commentary was mid single-digit organic growth was upside from M&A, now you guys approaching 9%, it sounds like you're expecting organic parts to continue to be strong. Can you help us think about how the original acquisitions you've made playing into the organic channel and whether the strategy has changed going forward to being more organic driven than acquisitions?","Chris Klein","Yes, I am delighted to talk about plumbing and GPG, it's going really well. So when we did a lot of work obviously before announcing this, the changes we made in the summer of '16 and we talked reorienting and really allowing for more products to go through our existing channels, leveraging our back end, doing some acquisitions, but really bringing more product through the channel that we've got. We did a couple of acquisitions early on and we followed on with some in '17 and that's going well.","They're executing really well, the acquisitions were of a very high quality and so those products and those brands are very well accepted in the channels that we\u2019ve got. So we're moving more products our stores we\u2019ve strong channel position across North America and across China, moving more product through China so that gives us greater confidence than I was even sitting here 18 months ago and as we\u2019re looking at other acquisitions as we're looking at partnership opportunities to get other brands and other products, and move through the system we feel really good.","We also invested in some talent, upgraded our marketing organization, our operations organization, the pace and cadence of innovation picked up and so we're pushing more product through a faster cadence and so that's working well, there's just a lot that's executing really well and so I feel good about you know we laid out a target of 2.5 billion by 2020 frankly that's a lower risk target now than it was 18 months ago having done some acquisitions and having improved out the organic side of it.","And it gives us more confidence as we're looking at other things that we might acquire, partnerships we might have, we have set of metrics here to understand what's reasonable that we can bring through that system and those guys are executing really-really well so it gives us a lot of confidence. And plumbing part of the market, we get really good margins there and our commitment is to kind of hold that margin at 21 to 22 in that range.","Starting 21, we can move ahead of that particular above the market and that's what we were able to in '17 and our plans are for '18, all quite reasonable and we're pretty excited, I mean we embarked upon something it looks great in a PowerPoint it looks great when you're talking about it, we got to execute and we now have two months execution and a team that's firing on all cylinders so we feel really good about the plumbing group right now.","Michael Eisen","Very helpful and very encouraging as well, I was just thinking of following up on some of these comments. As you look at your balance sheet and you talked about kind of a lull on the second half of the year in M&A activities specifically in that segment. Chris I think you mentioned that your, you might have deals that seem active now but significantly higher in the year looking at things with a more significant size than you had recently. Can you talk to maybe if that's more across the portfolio if you're considering things that are outside of your current product set and kind of bigger picture would it be unrealistic to expect more M&A activity outside of the plumbing group as you move forward the next couple of years, thanks and good luck?","Chris Klein","Thanks, I think we're looking at things within the portfolio across the businesses, probably more focus on plumbing than in the other sectors, we're looking in other sectors inside of our adjacent portfolio and we're looking at some things that are outside of the core, core but have very similar characteristics of being consumer oriented home products, not commodity building products. So strong brands, strong channel positions, strong pricing power, all those things that are allowing us to take price down are characteristics of things we look in terms of acquisitions.","Don't want to say too much because I'm going to give away stuff we're looking at but there's a lot of things we're looking at now and I think there's receptivity as we're looking at things, particularly I think clarity on the tax law helps, there were durations where people were wondering how that was going to unfold in terms of the state taxes. In general, I think just looking our inbound tax treatment on things we are acquiring is clear both international as well as domestic assets and then part of their selling understanding how things are going to get treated as they are realizing returns on new investments.","So I think there is clarity. We deliver it. We have had lot of things we are working on a lot of people we are talking to and we will remain disciplined and deliberate. But I think given this corporate the things we are looking at it I would expect we got additional things in 18 into 19 and we certainly have a balance sheet capacity to take those steps on. And so we put pressure on ourselves to look at and working a lot of things. We don\u2019t put pressures ourselves to close. I think we had trouble when you do that and pick corners.","So we are disciplined in that. I wouldn\u2019t call us over the conservative. We're smart about businesses and the factors that we are looking at. We have been in this long time. I have been in this long time. And so, we are working on it hard, spending a lot of time on it. But we will remain disciplined, and then we have excess capacity we will certainly be active find that peers we currently have 550 million I think authorization of outstanding.","So, you will see us doing that as well. So we will be active in the plan on our capital this year, it's back to the commitment I made 6.5 years ago when we became public that we have great operators we don\u2019t need the sales cash for any day. We will restructure new things every day so we are going to be aggressive in deployment of capital and we will take that spirit into '18. On the market that I just talked about is we can just be bigger in the market a lot of reasons to be positive.","Operator","Our last question comes from line of Philip Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Philip Ng","Good to hear you are pivoting some of your capacity and cabinets and doors to capture some of the growth down the road. But just curious how quickly can you ramp that up? And with selling the used investment make you served used first time homebuyers and lower labor intensity market to more effectively?","Chris Klein","So as often the case, we are in middle of it. I have to stay out of describing things that there are kind of new and interesting, as we have already been doing that, and as opposed to we are going to go to that. So, we have already even knowing this so. Yes, we are targeting parts of the market where we see good margin profile and good growth. Some of that is addressing first time homebuyer market are direct to builder business continues to be strong and our builder business through dealer is strong and national and we are coming assets with our strong portfolio which is coming into first time homebuyer universe.","So we are just sitting tighter. So as I talked about our -- we are going to harder in this direction that we have been moving and putting capacity in business up against the prices that we see the best opportunity. And not being afraid the back way from parts of the market that have underperformed and we are just not going to stick with stuff that is lack of cluster. And that\u2019s right now is some of that mid market I talked about some of that dynamics with the third largest home center which is not an attractive place to be in right now.","So, we are going to double down on prices we're growing, we are going to double down on the partners that are growing with us. And together, we are looking at opportunities on the market. We are already having success in that. We have just increased the focus in that part of the market. We have a great operating team. We have the best operating team in the industry in our cabinet group. And so, when we put our mind in stuff, we execute all the along.","In period of market moving, we are pretty deliberate about watching and don\u2019t overreact. But when we commit to something, these guys execute like crazy and they're in middle of it and then it's going well. So, you'll see it unfold throughout the year, and you see that margin moving. We will be expanding margin cabinets 50 basis points to 70 basis points and will come in close to 12% for the year-end and I won't keep margins forward. So feel good about that I think we evolved in this business over the last eight to nine years through recoveries, and it's a same core group just executing all over that business.","Philip Ng","And then the growth out of your plumbing business has been really impressive. Based on what you are seeing, do you think you are outpacing the market just from some of the investments you are making? And China seems to be really strong where there we see some concerns in that market the real estate market cooling little bit. Just want to get your thoughts on China as you think about 2018 as well?","Chris Klein","Sure. So overall in plumbing, we are facing the market for a fact to the basic of putting more products through the strength of the channels. So where we've had the business historically only focused on our narrower set of products with the single brand, we've now got multiple brands going through this channels and where we really leveraging the power and the strength of our presence and that's driving lot of growth, innovation is driving growth, investments were making in brand building and marketing is driving growth. E-commerce, we have an outstanding team there and they continue picking it up in market.","So in that core and that core North America, yes, we're gaining share and there is real strength there. China is probably a little bit better than I thought it would be. It's a good year and 18 frankly, is just looking good. I think the dynamic in China is overall the market tightening up, but there is a concentration in China with the bigger builders and the bigger builders are buying smaller builders. And we've got good relationships with the bigger builders. And so, proportionately we're winning there because of investments we've made over the last decade with the great relationships and executing well there.","And then the R&R part of that markets which come through, both showrooms and e-commerce is also strength for us. We've got 1,000 showrooms, Moen showrooms, across the country and we are focused Tier 1 and Tier 2. And so, we are in the markets where the R&R market is pretty consistent and growing. So I'd say that market unfolded better than I thought it would in '17. And looking at '18 and probably feeling better overall of their market dynamics, again I think a year ago, they will start building that markets there has been for a long time.","We've been there 24 years now and so we go through a lot of cycles in China, but we've got really good team on the ground been there a long time we've built that business from scratch and we how do it evolve with the market and leverage again the relationships and the channel strength where we see the end markets performing. We follow where that's strength is so we can execute well.","So, the market is doing well for us. We also expanded the product portfolio in China. We're moving to kind of full room solution and so, within the five to six years, we expanded into vanities, but most recently expanded into sanitary ware solutions and shower systems and other things. So when you got kind of these Moen standup stores, you can really be pushing problem solutions and that's gone really well. So, that dynamic and a market at their local footprint is strong for us and a strong completive advantage.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fortune Brands Home & Security 2014 Second Quarter Earnings and Results. [Operator Instructions] Brian Lantz, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, you may begin your conference.","Brian Lantz","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Fortune Brands Home & Security quarterly investor conference call and webcast.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams executed well and delivered a solid second quarter as the pace of new construction and consumer spending have gradually improved. We continue to gain share and we remain well positioned to deliver strong growth this year.","Our 2014 annual outlook has been updated to reflect the U.S. home products market that we now expect to grow at a slower pace in the second half than our assumptions earlier in the year. However, our revised company outlook calls for continued profitable growth based on our share gains and the improving markets for new construction and repair and remodel activity through the balance of 2014.","Let me first take you through some of the second quarter highlights, then I will discuss our recent actions to drive incremental growth, and finally, I'll tie it all together with our view of the current U.S. home products market and our updated 2014 annual outlook.","Turning to the quarter. Sales were up 10% and EPS was $0.55, up 34% from a year ago. Let me give you some highlights by segment. Sales for our cabinets business were up 19% for the quarter. Cabinet sales growth was led by mid-teens growth in the dealer channel, where big ticket remodeling activity remains strong, as well as nearly 10% growth in home center sales for our brands. We again gained share in the dealer channel, where we continue to see growth across a full range of semi-custom and custom product lines, resulting in a better mix with higher price points. Our share gains are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers, as well as new dealerships. Regionally, the South and the West continue to outpace the North and Midwest, which are improving versus the first quarter but at a more modest pace.","We've launched several new products this year, including our refreshed Diamond line, new bath vanity offerings in home centers and the new Omega frameless custom line for dealers. These new products are selling well. Our home center business continues to benefit and gain share from the innovation we are bringing into the category.","We continue to leverage our proven structural competitive advantages to generate sustainable momentum. This is a complex business, but our teams execute flawlessly against a business model that is tough to replicate. Our share gains across channels with improving margins reflect the tangible impact of these advantages. If we exclude the sales from WoodCrafters and the impact from last year's planned exit of low-margin builder direct business in the West, underlying cabinet sales were estimated to be up 10%. Plumbing reported sales that were up 5% for the quarter, led by growth in U.S. wholesale and international.","In the second quarter of 2014, Moen faced challenging sales comparisons in the wholesale channel versus the second quarter 2013, that saw wholesalers bring inventory and to support projected second half demand. This year is different as wholesalers drew down inventories to some extent, but mix was better and we were able to support some price.","Even with these dynamics, our sales grew mid-single digits and margins were strong. Across both retail and wholesale, we are encouraged to see consumers continue to select our innovative new faucet products for their new homes in repair and remodel projects, including new pullout faucets with reflex self-retraction in our Walden, Kinzel and Berkshire lines. Our MotionSense hands-free faucet, which continues to be introduced in additional styles and faucets with our Microban finishes. Overall, we see continued strength in the more premium end of the market, supporting bigger remodel and renovation projects. Moen international sales were led by Canada wholesale and retail sales, which increased high-single digits and improved from the weak first quarter. China sales were up modestly over the prior year as new construction activity was weaker and direct to builder sales softer but our 920 Moen stores continued to generate solid growth. Windows & Doors reported sales were up 9% for the quarter, drove product's healthy sales growth of 11% driven by gains in new construction and ongoing distribution additions. We continue to see an increasing benefit from our distribution improvement and expansion in the Western region that we put in place over the last couple of years. Mix also improved especially with consumer selecting our new decorative glass designs and the door styles like our new recently launched Pulse line of modern entry doors. The Therma-Tru brand continues to perform strongly across all channels.","Window sales were up 7% in the prior year with continued double-digit growth in the west and improved growth across the remainder of the country as the northern markets rebounded from the slower first quarter. In the Security & Storage segment, sales declined 5% from the prior-year quarter. Security sales were up 1%, led by increases in U.S. retail and safety, offset by some weakness in international. Store sales decreased by $9 million as we exited some lower margin accounts and the Father's Day promotional season was weaker. Master Lock U.S. retail sales continue to grow with program expansion at retailers. And Master Lock's roll out of new commercial electronic access control solutions designed to secure high value sites, such as cellular telephone towers and other storage facilities, again contributed to our sales gains.","So to sum up our results, our teams executed well in a modestly improving quarter. As we move into the balance of the year, we remain positioned to continue our share gains and deliver a stronger full year of sales and profit growth. I would now like to turn to our recent actions to drive incremental shareholder value with our cash flow and balance sheet. First, given the pullback in housing-related equities through the second quarter, we have continued to opportunistically repurchase our shares. As a result, we have now repurchased approximately $375 million of our shares year-to-date. These repurchases, along with our quarterly dividend, reflect confidence in our performance and our ability to drive long-term shareholder value. Second, today, we announced that we have acquired Sentry Safe, a leading producer of personal saves and protective security containers. Sentry will become part of Master Lock. We are thrilled to welcome nearly 500 Sentry associates to the Master Lock family. Sentry Safe's global brand strength in the adjacent safes market enables Master Lock company to broaden its market product offerings and leverage both iconic brands domestically and internationally. Both companies hold similar competitive advantages and produce products that protect people's most valuable assets. I'm excited about the growth opportunities we will now have together to drive innovation and leverage global distribution and manufacturing. These actions reinforce our commitment to create incremental shareholder value by investing in our businesses, pursuing accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I'm excited that we were able to identify opportunities and execute against our strategic priorities to drive this incremental value.","Now let me tie this all together with our updated full year outlook for 2014, starting with our assumptions for the market. The demand for new construction continues to outstrip supply in many markets across the country. Housing inventory remains low. Mortgage rates have remained stable over the past year and single-family homes are at historically affordable levels. We continue to believe that new construction will return to historic levels and that the R&R market will grow at 5% to 6% in a steady-state. In repair and remodel market, which is around 65% of our home products business, we see the continuation of the growth for bigger-ticket semi-custom and custom cabinets, as well as increased project size and stronger demand for more premium of faucets in our Moen wholesale showrooms. However, in the near term, the pace of repair and remodel demand has been recovering more gradually than we expected in half of the country impacted by weather early in the year even as demand has been solid for the remainder of the country. New home construction, where our products are installed in the later stages, has also been slower to reaccelerate since last fall. So while demand for both new construction and repair and remodel should show solid growth for the balance of the year, we expect the overall U.S. home products market growth for the second half will be somewhat lower than we assumed on our last call. Therefore, our updated 2014 annual outlook is built on a revised assumption that the U.S. home products market grows at a combined 6% to 8% annual rate. Based on that U.S. housing market projection, the assumptions we make for our other markets and continued share gains plus the Sentry Safe acquisition, we continue to expect solid top line growth for 2014 with our full year sales increasing at a 9% to 11% rate over 2013 and our home products business is growing faster and again, outperforming the market for our products. Based on this market and sales growth, and the benefit of share repurchases, our teams are focused on delivering full year EPS of $1.88 to $1.96.","So to sum up, we remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the recovering home products market and intend to deliver strong profitable growth in 2014. We believe that our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provides flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our strong free cash flow.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our 2014 outlook and on our recent capital allocation actions.","E. Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains, which best reflects ongoing business performance. Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.14 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $137 million, up 28% or $30 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.55 for the quarter versus $0.41 for the same quarter last year, an increase of 34%.","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $468 million, up $76 million or 19% over the prior-year quarter, led by growth in dealers and improvement in home centers. As Chris mentioned, excluding the sales of $50 million from WoodCrafters and the impact of $13 million from the planned exit of low-margin builder-direct business in the west, underlying cabinet sales were estimated to be up 10%. Operating income for the cabinet segment increased to $46 million, up $11 million or 31% as we benefited from higher sales volume, WoodCrafters and our improving mix from repair and remodel growth. Operating margin for the segment increased to 9.9%.","Turning to plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $340 million, up 5%, led by U.S. wholesale and international. Operating income increased $15 million to $70 million, up 26%. Operating margin for the segment was 20.6%. The increase above the anticipated annual operating margin of 19% was due primarily to consumers purchasing upgraded faucet packages and the timing of expenses. Windows & Doors sales were $193 million, up $16 million or 9% from the prior-year quarter. Operating income for this segment was $15 million, a $5 million improvement from the second quarter last year. Operating margin for the segment increased to 7.8%. Security & Storage sales were $141 million in the second quarter, down 5% to the prior-year quarter. Security sales increased 1%, while sales of storage products decreased by $9 million. Segment operating income was only $20 million, due to the lower tool storage sales and investments in security growth initiatives. Operating margin for the segment was 14%.","So to sum up the second quarter performance, we continue to leverage our structural competitive advantages to drive share gains and we're continuing to see better mix, driven by the improving R&R market. Before I turn to the balance sheet, I want to reiterate that we're continuing to make investments to begin building incremental capacity. As mentioned on our last call, these investments should enable us to expand capacity and infrastructure to support sales growth as the housing market returns to steady-state levels over the next 3-plus years. We need to make these investments this year so that we're positioned to capture the potential growth and should begin to realize the benefits of these investments later next year.","In the second quarter, these capacity investments were equal to approximately $0.02 of EPS and were mainly for incremental capacity for the cabinet and plumbing segments. For the full year, approximately $0.08 of incremental investment spending is reflected in our 2014 EPS guidance, including the $0.06 that we've now invested year-to-date. We will pace additional investments with the pace of the recovering market.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our June 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $145 million, debt of $605 million and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 0.9x. We have $245 million drawn on our $650 million revolving credit facility. Our balance sheet reflects the impact of share repurchases and year-to-date capital expenditures of approximately $47 million.","Turning to our recently announced actions to drive incremental shareholder value. These actions confirm that our cash flow and balance sheet provide additional levers to generate incremental growth and navigate through any unevenness in the near-term home products market. First, we've continued to opportunistically repurchase our shares. As of today, we repurchased around $9.5 million of our shares year-to-date for approximately $375 million, with $112 million remaining on our current authorization. These repurchases represent nearly 6% of our outstanding shares. And given our view on our potential performance over the next few years, should represent a significant return. The positive impact to earnings per share from share repurchases should be approximately $0.10, with $0.05 benefiting the second half of 2014, and an incremental $0.05 in 2015. Second, our acquisition of Sentry Safe into Master Lock is a natural fit, providing annual revenue of approximately $150 million. The purchase price of $117 million should be equivalent to 8x 2014 EBITDA. However, over the next couple of years, potential synergies resulting from the acquisition could reduce the purchase multiple to closer to 6x EBITDA. Before synergies, Sentry could add $0.02 of EPS to our 2014 second half performance and an incremental $0.02 to $0.03 in 2015. Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2014. As Chris mentioned, based on our projected 6% to 8% U.S. home products market growth, the assumptions we make for other markets and continued share gains, plus the Sentry Safe acquisition, we now expect our full year 2014 sales to increase 9% to 11% compared to 2013. Actions taken this year should position us for above-market sales growth in 2015 and '16. Our resulting expectations for full year 2014 EPS are now in the range of $1.88 to $1.96. The midpoint of our guidance was revised down only $0.02 and represents an increase of 28% over 2013 EPS of $1.50. The impact from share repurchases and our recent Sentry Safe acquisition nearly offset the impact of our lower market assumption. More importantly, these 2 value enhancing moves position us for above-market EPS growth in 2015 and '16.","Let me make a couple additional points regarding our 2014 annual outlook for sales and EPS in the second half. First, in the third quarter. We're faced with a challenging sales comparison against the 2013 performance that delivered robust 24% growth. Second, both our recently announced acquisition of Sentry Safe and our share repurchase actions will have more impact on the fourth quarter than the third quarter. Therefore, the fourth quarter will experience higher sales and EPS growth than the third quarter. We expect 2014 free cash flow to be $225 million to $250 million for the full year after CapEx of approximately $130 million to $140 million, as we begin to invest in incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential. Additionally, the board has authorized a September dividend of $0.12 per share.","In summary, our solid performance and the expected continuing market recovery not only give us confidence for the balance of 2014, but also for potential growth beyond 2014 as we continue to benefit from our structural competitive advantages. Importantly, this sustainable momentum in both the housing markets and in our business performance is allowing us to make selected acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase. These actions position us well for incremental growth in 2015 and beyond as we focus on maximizing shareholder value. I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks on the second quarter of 2014. We will now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","The Midwest and Northeast regions not bouncing back as much as maybe you would have thought particularly on the remodel side. Can you just give order of magnitude what you did see in the quarter relative to the first quarter? And then offer any thoughts you might have as to why that might be either from your internal data or from customers?","Christopher J. Klein","This is Chris. We lost the first part of your question, I think your mute button might have cut off the first couple of words of your question.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Sorry. The first part was just if you were to look at the Midwest and Northeast in the second quarter, how did that performance -- or the year-over-year growth compared to the first quarter? And then second part of it was any thoughts as to why it didn't accelerate more.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, so it came back -- I'd say, Midwest came back faster. Northeast a bit slower, both in the positive range. We thought they'd comeback a little bit faster than they did. So I'd say it was fine, but it did set up a second half, which might be a little slower as well. So that was kind of our sense of looking at the balance of the year, the market assumptions that we are making, and that's both kind of new construction activity in those regions, as well as the R&R activity.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I guess specifically on the R&R. Any thoughts as to whether it's more of a kick out or reasons why it didn't come back more?","Christopher J. Klein","No, it just -- it built back but it's slower. I think -- we talked a little bit in the first quarter about the fact that especially big project, big kitchen and bath remodel project takes a while to engage the designer to do the work to come to the point where you're making the order. And so there's a timeline around that, which -- it's taking a little while longer. But we're seeing plenty of activity in the showrooms. I think we have reason to believe second half is going to be busy and we're prepared for that. But I think we expected a little bit more momentum just coming in. In the other parts of the country, West, Southwest, South, it was really kind of just a continuation of what we were seeing. So that pattern looked pretty good.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. And then the second question. Just -- you talked about the dealer business being very strong and even excluding share gains, it seems like a strong number. And then mix and the plumbing segment, both of those things would seemingly be R&R related. So as you look at the change in the outlook in the second half of the year, can you may be split how much of that was driven by the pace of what you're seeing in new construction versus remodeling?","Christopher J. Klein","No, I think it was more on the new construction side. So that was the bigger impact. Maybe it was half a point on the R&R to really cover kind of the regional slowness Northeast. Well, I think the thing that we're excited about is the mix continues to hold up strong. These aren't just kind of value-type purchases, but we're seeing good mix across not just cabinets but faucets and entry doors and we've got some pricing power. So it feels pretty good actually and coming into the second half, really setting up '15 and '16. So I mean, we're excited about kind of what's coming at us over the next 2 or 3 years and I think we look for those kinds of stable points in the market, which mix is a good indicator of people got a willingness. Once they're in a project, once they're willing to take something on, they're spending money. So that's good sign. That's certainly a lot better than we were a couple of years back.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I had 2 questions. Let me follow-up on Dennis' question regarding the big-ticket. It just want to clarify one thing because in your prepared remarks, it sounded like you were talking about continued strength in bigger-ticket, but you kind of co-mingled that with a statement about how you were seeing kind of more custom, higher price points. And I just want to make sure that what I'm hearing from you is not just that you've seen the benefit of some higher-end SKU. But also that just in general, larger kitchen remodel type works or bath remodel type work, irrespective of whatever how much luxury or entity level it may be. Just that you're continuing to see more demand for larger projects up or down the price spectrum.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. I'd say it is up and down the price spectrum. I think the mix shift on the higher end is encouraging. But we also saw, especially within the home center, some good kind of heart of market type volume. Some of that would be some new products we've brought in, so that might be share gain as well that we picked up in that segment of the market. But I'd say there is still some appetite on the value end of the market and certainly seeing demand for that and then we're seeing that mix on the higher-end. So I'd say we're encouraged, I think kind of coming off of a weak first quarter into the second quarter seeing that kind of mix come through. And on a base level, looking at the cabinet business being up 10% over what wasn't a bad second quarter last year. There's a lot of things that are going right to have that happen.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. No, that's never encouraging and certainly better than what we've heard from some others. I want to ask about plumbing, if I could, next. You made the commentary that margins in the quarter were higher than your expected annual 19% rate. It sounds like you're still holding to due to better mix and deferred expenses. But by virtue of the fact that you are not changing your 19% outlook for the year, I assume that a hefty dose of this was the deferred expenses, which will then hit in later quarter. I was wondering if you could sort of talk about how much was the deferred expenses? How much is the better mix? And why you are not raising your outlook for the year?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, it starts with our operating margin last year at 17.8% and then on our first quarter call this year, we said that we could pick up, we thought given the way we saw the business, another 100 basis points, which approach -- starts approaching 19%. So that was, we thought, a good estimate then and we think it's a good estimate now. And a lot of the expenses just within Moen was just purely timing. A large portion of that 20.6% difference between the 19% and the 20.6% was just timing of expenses. And those will come back in the second half. So we still think 19% is a good percent. Still lets us invest in the business, do what we need to do from a marketing and other investment perspective. So we think 19% will be a great operating margin for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the Sentry business. I think you talked about kind of current snapshot of what the business is and from a topline perspective and the EBITDA multiple. But could you talk to -- maybe some color around as a stand-alone business what the trajectory has been for sales and margins in that business? And what you think about as a good growth rate going forward?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. So we look at 2014 and we basically said, just to frame it, sales of around $150 million. It's got operating margins around 8% right now. EBITDA margins, closer to maybe a little under 10%. Good sales growth in the past. What we're really excited about is the opportunities that we have with Master Lock and the growth that, that can come from with brand stratification. Sentry Safe is a great brand. Coupled with Master Lock, it will give us a lot of opportunities. So we paid $117 million at about a $14 million EBITDA, that's about 8x. We think over the next 2 years, and probably in the second year more than next year because a lot of these are revenue synergies, we think we get that backup to Master Lock kind of operating margins of 13%, 14%, 15%. So pretty excited about what we can do with it and get it down to -- in a couple of years an -- a purchase price multiple around 6x. So it's -- we're very, very fortunate to find this one.","Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's great. And then, I guess, for modeling purposes. Since this was in your quarter, is there any guidance around what the top line impact should be for 3Q, 4Q?","E. Lee Wyatt","Sure. When you -- in our guidance, we said for the full year, sales up 9% to 11%, about 180 basis points of that is Sentry Safe, about $75 million in the second half. Now you'll get more just from a quarterly standpoint. The seasonality of their business there will be substantially more sales in the fourth quarter than the third, but we'll get a benefit total of about $75 million. That's about $0.02 after some amortization from the acquisition. We'll get about $0.02 this year in the second half. Next year, we'll get an incremental $0.02 or $0.03, so net of $0.05 before any synergies next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question for Lee. In your updated guidance, what should we assume in terms of share buyback?","E. Lee Wyatt","At this point, I think we would not assume any share buybacks. We will, from a practical manner, be very opportunistic, but we bought 9.5 million back shares year-to-date. So we wouldn't put anything in there for share repurchases in the future. The benefits will roll out nicely though. We'll get $0.05 for this year and because of the averaging under a fully diluted methodology, you'll get another $0.05 next year. So it will still -- it will continue to give even through '15, so well-positioned. But don't plan on anymore this year. It doesn't say we won't do it. We'll always be opportunistic and we'll balance share repurchases, and we'll balance the M&A pipeline and those things.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just kind of taking with that share repo question, Lee. in your new guidance, it looks like you're about to have free cash flow of $225 million to $250 million. You already got a really clean balance sheet. What's the acquisition outlook from an M&A standpoint going forward? What should we expect, like which categories of product should we be looking for you guys to make purchases? And kind of what's the -- how should we think about magnitude and timing?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I think we're encouraged. It's becoming a busier market. And beginning of the year, I said I thought that over the next 12, 18 months, things will start to pick up. And as we sit here in July, we've got a pretty good flow coming through. We're really excited about the Sentry Safe acquisition. It's a terrific complement to the Master Lock business. But there's other things we're looking at. I can never forecast how many of those will come to fruition. I can just say that there's more activity now than there has been. And so we're encouraged by that. And so I think we're pleased that we have the opportunity to buy back some shares. But now we're saying that there could be some M&A opportunity, so maybe focus there a little bit and see how all that plays out over the next 6, 9 months. So kind of encouraged that maybe -- that market has fallen a little bit and there's a number of things that could come in. I'd say where we're looking is really kind of across the businesses and there's various opportunities across -- might not do anything in Master Lock right now given we've just done something but I think the other categories could be fair game and certainly looking at various opportunities within each of them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zener from KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could expand a little bit on your cabinet comments. The 10% organic, what was kind of the relative split there between these weather-impacted areas and between the dealer and the big box or retailer however, you feel comfortable describe -- just give us different rates of growth in those 3 different kind of categories, including new.","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. I'd just say, I think we saw good growth across the country, better growth in the West, Southwest, South that become the fastest-growth area, Midwest in the middle and Northeast a bit slower. But all seeing positive signs. In terms of channel, I'd say kind of mid-teens on the dealer side. Roughly 9 -- 10% on the home center side and direct-to-builder, probably a little bit less than that. So pretty good spread across the whole piece. I think the strongest momentum was on the dealer side but the home center business was actually pretty reasonable as well. So hope that helps in terms of break out.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, that's very good. And related to the walkaway business that you described at $13 million, is there a way that we can kind of think about that headwind given the organic baseline kind of tapering off? And would you mind describing that 10% revenue growth? If you could kind of split that or give us a sense of price and mix as opposed to volume.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My first question, just around the cabinet margins. I believe previously you had guided for the full year to a 10% number or approaching 10%. I just wanted to know if that's still the case. And perhaps as part of the answer to that, if you could describe the -- what you see in terms of the promotional environment at retail? If that continues to be stable or how do you characterize the trends there.","E. Lee Wyatt","Sure. For our cabinet business, the quarter was -- operating margin, 9.9%. We said on the last call, we thought we could approach 10% for the year. I think we're still in that range, somewhere 9% to 10%. So we have not fundamentally changed that look.","Christopher J. Klein","On the promotional side within the home center market, it's actually quite stable, maybe even surprisingly so. We haven't really, for ourselves, moved over the last, really, 2 years relative to where we are today, kind took it down early and then we've held. We're really competing more on product, on service, on the time we spend with the designers to help them kind of work in our products. And so we're not as reliant on promotion. So I think, for us at least, it hasn't change materially.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just secondly, switching to the Security & Storage margins, and I apologize if missed this earlier, but if you could just describe if you had kind of touched on it, maybe a little more granularity, the driver of the margin decline on a year-over-year basis for Security & Storage? And maybe what was the biggest driver to that? And if you'd expect that to continue in the back half of the year?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. On Security & Storage, our longer-term margins have been 14% to 15%. We dropped down to 14% in the second quarter, driven by 2 things. One was the volume decline in our tool storage business. We lost some leverage there. And while Master Lock margins continue to be good, we started investing some -- in some growth initiatives, part of it on top of thinking about this acquisition and some other things. So we wanted to build a little more infrastructure. That put a little pressure on the Master Lock segment margins, but they're still very good. So we're -- the 14% operating margins in the quarter is very good. There's no real messages there in that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Research","This is Adam in for Mike. Can you just talk us through how sort of the sales trended month by month throughout the quarter and sort of what you're seeing now in July?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. March -- I'm sorry, April started out a little bit improved from March and then gradually built throughout the month of June, finished up pretty good. July is traditionally a quiet month and we're comping against a quarter here where we were up 24% last year. So I'd say July is fine, but it's kind of early to read the whole quarter. Traditionally, the third quarter starts to come in kind of August and then really build momentum towards the end of August into September. It's a heavy R&R season. And so that -- I'd say it's early to say, certainly no warning signs. I think it's tracking as we would expect it, but it's kind of too early to get a solid read until we get into August and September.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird.","Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess just 2 housekeeping questions. On the corporate expense line, I think it's been about $30 million year-to-date there. What should expect the pace of that in the back half of the year to be? And then secondly, as we look at the $0.08 of investments in 2014, how should we think of those investment levels as we get into 2015?","E. Lee Wyatt","I'd say -- I'd said start with -- on the corporate side, the, I think, a run rate of assuming no one-time charges per M&A transactions, we think we're in the $62 million range. We're lower this year than last year because we had some one-time items around WoodCrafters' acquisition and some other consulting around that. So I'd say if you think about a $62 million annual run rate with no one-time items, that kind of gets you there. And then the $0.08, we've talked about it at the beginning of the year, things that would hit the P&L, not depreciation but things that hit the P&L directly, the planning and the design things around the capacity expansion would be $0.08 this year. We spent $0.04 in the first quarter, $0.02 in the second. We think we'll have a couple of cents left this year. Next year, haven't really done those -- that math yet. I think the heavy spending was probably this year, but we may still have some next year.","Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So incrementally, some of that might go away a little bit but some of it might stick around.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, and we'll talk about that when we give annual guidance next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zener from KeyBanc.","Christopher J. Klein","Ken, I'm sorry we got cut off. Would you just repeat those questions for me?","E. Lee Wyatt","We weren't ignoring you.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It never is. I think I asked about the 10% organic rate that you referenced and I appreciate your channel commentary. But if you could, A, kind of give us a detailed feel around volume, price\/mix since that's something you're talking about so we can understand the underlying volume. And then the $13 million headwind from walked away business, could you kind of give us a sense of when or the magnitude of that headwind deceleration as we look into the back half?","E. Lee Wyatt","Sure. So on the price mix, volume question, price, net of inflation, was less than 1% in the quarter. So we got some price to offset inflation. We are seeing some modest inflation. So we did get some price but the bigger driver here is always for us is mix and volume. So I'd say price is the smallest, volume and mix would be the 2 larger items. In terms of the business, the cabinet business, builder direct in the West that we walked away from. I think about -- you can think about it for the full year to be in the $55 million to $60 million range. We had about $10 million reflected in the first quarter results. We had about $13 million reflected in this second quarter. The balance will be spread in the second half and then will be finished at the end of the year generally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the capacity program and -- that you've outlined the $0.08 this year that was set in place for future growth. Does the slowdown in building product's opportunity this year, it all changed your thoughts on how quickly you're going to have to add back the capacity moving forward?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. I'd say it's a question of pacing at the individual segment level. So we talked about this a little bit beginning of the year. These are discrete expansions around individual facilities. So it's maybe adding a line, expanding out the size of a footprint. So I think certainly there's a pacing issue in there. The other work that we're doing this year was making sure that we're understanding exactly where and how we're going to be building out. And we started to put some capital in, but certainly the pacing of our capital is a little bit slower. So I think we're still on track and I still would highlight that we still believe we're headed toward a longer-term steady-state new construction at the 1.4 million, 1.5 million level, 5% to 6% R&R. If that's 6 months pushed out or trending a little bit longer, we still want to be prepared with the capacity. We're certainly able to handle the business that's coming out today but as we look out through now you'd say second half of '15 into '16, we want to make sure that we continue to service the business. That's one of the reasons why we're able to growth in these kind of markets. You look at our cabinet business and how it's able to continue to service business. Lead time is short, those things is -- we don't want to be chasing. We're not putting in capacity so far ahead when we'd use it but we certainly don't want to be chasing it on the back end. The same would be true for Moen and Therma-Tru. We just want to make sure that we're prepared as it's coming in because one of our hallmarks is our service and our ability to stay on top of this stuff. So that's the eye, but certainly, pacing, yes. I mean, we're kind of looking at it month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, making sure we're not getting too far ahead.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And I guess just a follow-up question to the Sentry Safe acquisition. Just if you could talk a little bit about the opportunity cost of the timing around the deal. You said the deal pipeline for other opportunities, is this starting to pick up? Just wondering with respect to the timing and the business that you picked up, obviously, it is accretive, but how did you weigh this opportunity versus others?","Christopher J. Klein","We've got a pipeline of things that we're looking at all the time and really, it's a question of when we're able to come to an agreement when the company is wanting to sell. So something like Sentry Safe, we've been aware of, looking at, hoping for, for a while. And it was really -- the time was now for it to be ready, but it isn't -- it doesn't preclude other things and in fact, we're -- we've got a team that's working things in parallel across a number of different sectors. And so I wouldn't say there's an opportunity cost of this versus that. I'd say, when it's ready, we'll do it and we're able to handle more than one thing at a time. So we're excited. I mean, Sentry Safe is really a terrific adjacency to the Master Lock. They're both market-leading brands and they've got some complementary product applications. We think there's places that we can take the Master Lock product that Sentry is in and vice versa. So it's really one of those adjacencies is a quite natural thing for Master Lock and we've got a very strong team at Master Lock that's able to take this on and really bring it into the Master Lock family. So I'd say in terms of trading off other things, I think it is all complementary and we truly handle multiple things at the same time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Hackel from Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question just going back to, I guess, more of a broad question, talking about who's spending money. Do you think you're seeing broad -- the broad spectrum of consumers increasingly spend money or how would you weigh more of the high-end versus the middle-end versus the low-end, how they're coming back in this recovery so far? I mean, it sounds like you're seeing nice trade up and you're making it sound like it's sort of across the board, but I just maybe if you're reiterating or -- clarify that, that would be helpful.","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. The probably -- on balance, it's probably skewed towards the higher end right now. We're encouraged that we're seeing more of that kind of value side continue to be in the market. The one piece that's probably missing the more credit dependent consumer who traditionally would finance, I think that's improving relative to where it was. If you look at the statistics on home equity lending, they are improving. There's more home-equity lines out there and people are drawing on those home-equity lines. There's in-store credit, there's dealer-sponsored credit. So there is credit coming back into the market, and that's helping support that level of the younger household. By younger, it's kind of the mid-30s to mid-40s which traditionally does need credit to do a big remodel project. So that's the piece, I think, is still coming and we still have more ahead of us on that. People who've got the means, either through savings or through trading out of the equity market are spending. And when they're spending, they're putting the money they want to into the project and so that's kind of getting lift on the higher end. So I'd say it's not too bad in that middle segment, but there's probably more to come as you get more lending into those households and consumers are getting more comfortable borrowing against the equity that's starting to build in the homes, as values improve across the country. So the ingredients are there. You always hope it'd be coming along a little bit faster but were not discouraged by the pace. We're all making good progress here kind of over our reasonable timeline.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just a second question just on Moen in China. You mentioned it's still positive. Are you seeing trends there continue to decelerate, have they stabilized or are they trying to reaccelerate?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. So small business, you kind of got 2 parts of that business. We've got our retail stores, over 900 of those. And those service, both new construction and repair and remodel market. But in the quarter, we still saw good growth coming there, so we knew that's the combination of people coming in and doing some R&R work where they're fitting out units that they had bought that was constructed years before. And now they're -- finally people and moving into them so they're having to fit them out. On the direct-to-builder side, so we just sell some business directly to the big builders there. That's the piece that was down and that's where we do see weakness given the slowdown in construction markets in a lot of the markets around China, so kind of balance those 2 together, we were up a little bit. I think my outlook for the rest of the year would be, I think we'll continue to see some good growth on the corporate retail side of the business and direct-to-builder piece will be just more tied to the general construction pace in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, if you look at the cabinet business and plumbing business, your 2 big businesses, could you talk about what you think was going on with market share in each of those? On the cabinet side, both the dealer and retail, do you think you were picking up market share pretty usefully? Or are you starting to see an acceleration of that business? And then on the plumbing, the reverse. I know you said you saw some inventory drawdown, but how long do think that plays out and were you giving up any share there?","Christopher J. Klein","I'll start with the Moen side. I do think it is tied to inventory. So as we look at POS data, we're certainly seeing much stronger performance there than what we'd see in the sales for the quarter, which says that we're doing pretty well especially in showrooms and -- on the retail side of the market. I think inventory was down a little bit, which I don't tend to get too worried about it, it tends to then come back to us down the road as they kind of bring it back in for the subsequent quarter. So I'm encouraged. We think we still picked up some pretty good share at Moen, both wholesale and retail. We're bringing in new products, they're selling well and we continue to execute well. Strong showroom business. So yes, I think they're -- we're positive. On the cabinet side, it's probably more so. We're still very encouraged, both on the dealer side and on the home centers. In dealers, we've talked before about the fact this is a ground game. It's one dealer at a time. It's working within that dealer, one sale at a time. And we're just so good at being in the market and with our sales and service teams bringing products and adjust executing every day, day in and day out. The cumulative impact is we're just picking up share and we just have a great reputation in the market. On the home center side, it's more of there's kind of 3 big guys there. And again, you have to keep executing. We have brought in some new products, refreshed some things and just been consistently executing there and we're picking up share there, too. So I think -- that, I think, if you look at kind of a steady-state 10% growth kind of taking the noise out. We think that's stronger than the market was overall. And so that would reflect those share gains.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you talked in the past about you would be comfortable taking your net debt to total cap around 40% or so. And as you look at where you are in the cycle now, some of the acquisitions you made, some of the share repurchase you made, any changes in how you view that particular level?","E. Lee Wyatt","No. We feel good about our cash flow generation and our business model. So longer-term, through the cycle, 2x debt is -- we're very comfortable with. For the right acquisitions, for the compelling acquisitions or group of acquisitions, kind of mid -- in this mid cycle now, we can lever up with the knowledge that we can always lever back down, as we generate so much cash. So I think run rate, you'd say long-term 2x debt-to-EBITDA but clearly, for the right acquisition, could go higher.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what would you feel comfortable with on that metric?","E. Lee Wyatt","I think you can clearly go to 3x, you could approach 4x for the right acquisition in the right time of the cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, you referred in the release and your expectations for the home improvement market for the year. Can you kind of split that up, what you think it grew in the first half of the year that can be actually tough to nail down in this industry? And number two, what was the ending share count in the second quarter?","E. Lee Wyatt","Let me take the share count. At the end of the second quarter was 161 million shares. We started the year around 167 million, first day of the year. So second quarter, 161 million. By the end of July, though, we did quite a few acquisition -- share repurchases in July. We were down about 158 million.","Christopher J. Klein","And then in terms of market growth. First half, you're right. It's tough to pin down. A lot of the data gets revised almost on a weekly basis, so it's hard to know. I think overall market between R&R and new construction may have been around 3% in the second quarter. That's kind of what we thought. It could have been 5%, 6% first quarter, not sure. It's -- we're still kind of sorting that through but those are the kind of working data and then it was -- we kind of project that out. We got to tie out to that 6% to 8% for the full year, which implies second half 6%, 7% third quarter, 10%, 11% fourth-quarter type growth. So that's kind of the net basis of getting to kind of 6% to 8% overall.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then the big acceleration in the fourth quarter, is that just more remodeling coming back in the market, is that a question of starts? Which one would be the driver on that pickup?","Christopher J. Klein","I think the market itself was slow in the fourth quarter. So this is relative to that growth in fourth quarter last year. And so you saw actually a pretty strong third quarter market and then the fourth quarter was when you started to see the impact of the slowdown on new construction that started in the summer kind of hit it in the fourth quarter. So it's just relative to where we were in '13. And so I'd say on an aggregate basis, you could see momentum building in the third quarter and carry into the fourth quarter and I actually think we will see some better business for ourselves in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our last call comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.","Thomas Mahoney","This is Tom on for Eric. I just wanted to ask about the cabinet incremental margin in the quarter, below the levels you guys have seen. In the first half, it seems to be below the levels you guys had seen over the last couple of years. You talked about getting some price there and strong mix there. What are the other moving pieces on that margin line that we need to be considering?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. I would say for the cabinet business, the first half, the incremental margins were lower, but we then started making the investment. This is where some of the investments that we talked about in terms of the $0.08 for the and year-to-date $0.06. And we're starting to -- there's a little bit of an inefficiency as you start moving these around but this is where the investments are. I think when you look at cabinets for the full year, we've seen incremental margin that's right in our sweet spot, the 25% to 30% will be kind of where we'll be for the year. We really don't have an issue there, it's more the timing of the investment.","Operator","I now turn the call back over to Brian Lantz for closing remarks.","Brian Lantz","Thank you, Lianne.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams delivered profitable growth in the third quarter in the face of challenging comps, select channel inventory reductions and slower than anticipated repair and remodel activity. Importantly, our businesses remained focused on targeting the most attractive segments of our markets and we delivered strong profit performance across all four segments.","Since late September and through the month of October, we've seen the pace of orders across our business strengthen, returning to levels that we would expect. So, based on our solid third quarter performance, consistent execution and our current assumption for market growth, we're revising our full year outlook for sales growth to 9% to 10%, while confirming our previous EPS outlook.","Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market, followed by my thoughts on our business performance in the third quarter. Then I would like to discuss the recent creation of our Global Plumbing Group and why we view this platform is the first step to further accelerating growth for the Plumbing segment. And finally, since we've just celebrated our five year anniversary as an independent company, I'll provide my perspectives on the company that we have built and how we have positioned ourselves to maximize growth and value for the years ahead. Lee will then provide more details on our third quarter performance and our 2016 outlook.","Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the third quarter, the market for our home products grew at the lower end of the pace that we expected. We estimate that repair and remodel activity grew at around 4%, and new construction grew generally as expected.","Our businesses experienced repair and remodel activity that began to slow in July and was clearly slower throughout August and the first half of September.","While demand was slower over this period, our channels also reported a tighter labor market at available contractors and trades people to take on incrementally more projects over the summer months after a fast start to the year.","Notably over the past five weeks, we've seen R&R activity and order patterns improve and more consistent with what we would expect starting in mid-September and continuing through October and consumers continuing to drive an improving mix within our categories.","New construction demand continues to grow as expected with single family growing faster than multi-family and single family entry-level activity continuing to improve.","Looking at the full-year 2016, our overall assumption is that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales grows at a combined rate of around 6%.","Within the year, we saw upside in the first quarter driven by better weather. The second quarter was pretty much as we expected. The third quarter saw a slower repair and remodel activity partially due to labor constraints. And with our current visibility into order patterns, the fourth quarter is shaping up to be on plan. Taken together, 2016 will be a good year.","Looking forward, our basket of new term indicators for the home products market remains pointed to strong underlying demand, some constraints in skilled labor, significant levels of single-family new construction activity, and continued market momentum as we head into 2017.","Now, let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the third quarter, our teams delivered strong performance across all operating segments. Sales increased 3% and total company operating margin increased to 14.8%.","Starting with our Cabinet segment, we continue to follow disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Our consistent pace of product innovation and our high levels of reliable service to our channel partners continued to drive performance.","In the third quarter, our overall Cabinet sales were flat to the prior year and operating margins driven by an increasingly efficient operations and an improving mix expanded to 12.4%. Excluding last year's third quarter load-in to support a major new vanity program launch and promotional timing, our total Cabinet sales increased mid single-digits in the quarter. And the dealer channel sales grew both single-digits overall. However, sales grew solid mid-single-digits in all of our core semi-custom product lines, and we continued to see mix improve.","In our luxury lines, which make up a little more than 25% of our dealer channel volume sales were lower. Overall, dealers are seeing strong growth from our new construction products, we're benefiting from deeper relationships with existing customers, and we're beginning to see some cross-sell benefits from our Norcraft acquisition.","Sales for our in-stock cabinets and vanities which are sold through home centers were down, but grew high single-digits when adjusted for the comparison to last year's load-in and promotional timing in the third quarter. The sell-through of the new program and product upgrades that we launched last year are performing very well and we're planning for the launch of additional new programs in 2017.","Our Cabinet team has been focused on partnering with our customers to continue to deliver on consumer trends and drive growth in our in-stock cabinet and vanity programs.","The remaining 25% to 30% of our Cabinets business, which includes home center special order, semi-custom, builder direct and targeted markets and Canada, grew mid-single-digits. We're disciplined in our approach to these segments as we focus on where we can partner with our customers to capture profitable growth. With our focused approach we grew share in these segments and drove strong margin improvement. We're especially pleased with our home center special order business, where our partnership approach is working well and driving growth at above market rates with an improving mix.","In summary, I feel good about our industry leading cabinet business. We continue to execute well and deliver strong results even in a quarter where the market was not as strong as we planned. We're building share in the most attractive segments of the market. Our plants are increasingly more efficient and our new product introductions and program wins are helping us drive a richer mix across a number of price points in the market.","For our Plumbing segment, sales were up 7% for the quarter, with solid mix and strong operating margin. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from the recent acquisitions, sales increased to 6% driven by strength in U.S. wholesale, China and Canada. Across our markets, we continue to see consumers trade up and our mix improve as innovation and design, finish and function attracts consumers who trust our brand.","As we look at the remainder of the year, our growth should benefit from incremental marketing spend, a healthy new construction market, and more focus on recently launched products. Sales in Canada were up high single digits to the prior year where we were gaining share. Notably we continued to see strong growth in the urban markets with our home center partners. China sales increased double digits versus the prior year. Sales gains were brought across the China business particularly in our Moen branded stores where we continue to drive increased productivity.","Doors reported sales were up 4% for the quarter. Door products again saw sales growth in both wholesale and retail. Therma-Tru continues to benefit from the rollout of a refreshed retail strategy that includes an enhanced product line, simpler, more intuitive displays, and better sales support for our customers' associates. And in wholesale, we continue to benefit from strong new construction placements and our enhanced distribution in the southern and western U.S.","In the Security segment, sales increased 6% from the prior-year quarter and were up approximately 8% excluding the negative impact of the planned exit of some less profitable Sentry Safe product lines. The growth came from multiple channels and geographies and we were beginning to see profit improvement from the integration of Sentry Safe into Master Lock. We're also ramping up our Sentry sales efforts as we continue to be excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years.","So to recap the quarter, our teams are consistently leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver profitable growth. We executed well in a U.S. home products market that is continuing to expand despite periodic labor constraints among installers and tradesmen and we are gaining momentum in our Security business with Sentry integration behind us.","Now let me turn to the newly formed Global Plumbing Group, which is a key strategic step to enable accelerated organic and incremental long-term growth. The approach to the GPG is much like the evolution of our Cabinets business into a platform that can support multiple brands across multiple price points sold into leading channel positions supported by dedicated supply chains. The new GPG platform structure should allow us to accelerate growth while leveraging our global supply chain and strong distribution. It paves the way for additional acquisitions, joint ventures and supply agreements and allows for a seamless integration and continued growth.","While only an initial step, we've recently made our first two acquisitions as part of this new platform. Riobel is a premium Canadian showroom brand which brings strong innovation and best-in-class service. We've also recently purchased ROHL, which includes both the ROHL and Perrin & Rowe brands, which bring a design-centric artisanal approach to luxury products. Under the GPG, these additions now have even greater potential for profitable growth.","The new Global Plumbing Group enhances the potential for future growth as we look to grow our Plumbing sales to $2.5 billion by 2020. We're excited about the opportunity to transform our business, enter new markets, develop new products, manage our channels and customers more holistically and accelerate both organic and incremental growth.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Lee, we're proud that we've just celebrated our five year anniversary as an independent company. And we're excited about our accomplishments over a relatively short period of time. Our teams have executed extremely well and delivered outstanding results. But I'm even more excited about the foundation that we've built to drive both organic and incremental growth over the next five years.","Notably in our first five years, this team has nearly doubled our sales and more than doubled our operating margin. We've increased our EPS almost five fold. We've deployed capital in value creating ways which include making five acquisitions for $1.4 billion, repurchasing over $900 million of our shares, and initiating and consistently increasing a dividend. And we've delivered exceptional returns for our shareholders.","At the same time, we've evolved and positioned our businesses for future growth by building on our structural competitive advantages and our leading market share positions, creating stronger operating capabilities and platforms, driving new products, new programs and new distribution, investing in capacity and productivity and by strengthening our management team and aligning incentives to focus on driving shareholder value.","The favorable demographics driven by housing demand from the longer-living Baby Boomers and increasingly the Millennials, we've seen elongated new construction cycle and pent-up R&R demand being realized. These demand drivers, coupled with the stronger business model we have created, position us extremely well not only for 2017, but for the next several years.","Additionally, over the next three years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value through strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and increasing our dividend.","To sum up, R&R demand was softer in the summer, but after accounting for inventory impacts and some market labor constraints, the core of our business continued to perform well and we're maintaining share. So, I am quite comfortable with the top-line performance as we head into the balance of the year, as we're picking up sales in the better parts of the market which drive profitable growth. With respect to the bottom-line, I am very pleased. Margins in the quarter were again strong and we're pacing ahead of our planned long-term profit targets. And lastly, I am encouraged by what we've seen in terms of our orders over the last five weeks. It's exciting to me that fundamental demand is still healthy, even if there was some softness this summer.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who'll review our third quarter financial performance and provide detail on our outlook for 2016.","E. Lee Wyatt - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.","Let me start with our third quarter results. Sales were $1.28 billion, up 3% from a year ago. However, simply adjusting for the major program launch and promo event in Cabinets last year, company sales would be up 5%. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $189 million, up 13% or $21 million compared to the same quarter last year.","EPS were $0.80 for the quarter versus $0.64 for the same quarter last year, increasing 25% or $0.16. Earnings were strong and ahead of expectations driven by continued stronger operating performance and a lower tax rate.","Now let me provide more color on segment results. Our third quarter Cabinet sales reflect the combination of very challenging comps and a softer R&R market. Sales were $602 million, approximately flat from the prior year, but increased mid-single-digits excluding the major program launch and promotional event for in-stock vanities in the third quarter of 2015.","Dealer sales increased low single-digits from the prior year, core semi-custom sales at dealers increased mid-single-digits while luxury products were lower this quarter. Sales from in-stock cabinets and vanities decreased due to the prior year product launch and promotional event. Excluding the prior year activity which was $23 million of the total $38 million increase last year, in-stock cabinets and vanities sales increased around 7%.","Remaining sales for home center semi-custom, builder direct and Canada increased 6%. Within those remaining sales, Canada declined largely due to the areas impacted by the downturn in the energy industry.","In spite of flat sales, our Cabinet segment continued to increase its leading operating margin. Operating income for the Cabinet segment increased $11 million or 17% over the prior year. Operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points to 12.4%. For the full year, we expect an operating margin of around 11% compared to 9% in 2015.","Turning to Plumbing, the GPG generated solid sales growth in the third quarter. Sales were $391 million, up $27 million or 7%. Excluding select channel inventory reductions and sales from acquisitions, sales increased 6%. Sales in Canada increased 8%, and China sales increased 11%.","In spite of around $7 million in additional brand spending, the GPG maintained its leading operating margin. Operating income increased $3 million to $85 million, up 4% from the prior-year quarter. Operating margin for the segment was 21.7%. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be over 21%, including incremental brand spending of $6 million in the fourth quarter.","Door sales were $129 million, up $5 million or 4% from the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 34% with an operating margin of 17.3%, which benefited by around a 100 basis points due to expense timing. Full year operating margin for this segment is expected to be around 12.5%.","Security sales were $157 million in the third quarter, up 6% to the prior year. Segment operating income was $27 million and the segment operating margin was 17%, which also benefited by nearly a 100 basis points due to expense timing. For the full year 2016, operating margin is expected to be around 14% with an expected fourth quarter margin of over 15%.","To sum up consolidated third quarter performance, sales increased 3% and EPS were ahead of plan at $0.80. Our total company operating margin was 14.8%, up 130 basis points from the prior-year with an incremental margin of more than 50%. We are ahead of plan on our operating margin growth and squarely on track to reach our goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state levels.","Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the impact of lower tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the quarter is down from the prior year due to the previous adoption of the new accounting standard that requires companies to reflect the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation transactions in their tax rate and EPS. While our previous guidance assume some benefit in both the third quarter and fourth quarters, our current guidance assumes all benefit was realized in the third quarter.","Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our September 30, balance sheet remains solid with cash of $279 million, debt of $1.59 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage declined to 1.7 times.","By year-end, we expect leverage to decline another 10 basis points to 20 basis points, excluding any additional capital transactions.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2016. Our market and sales assumption for 2016 now call for U.S. home products market growth of 6%, down from 6% to 7%, due to softer summer repair and remodel activity that Chris discussed earlier. Accordingly, we now assume total global market growth of 5% down from our 5% to 6% expectation earlier in the year.","Based on that market assumption, we now expect our full year 2016 sales to increase 9% to 10% compared to 2015. We have narrowed the range on our outlook for 2016 EPS to $2.72 to $2.76. The midpoint of our full year EPS outlook remains unchanged at $2.74, based on our continuing strong operating margin performance and the lower annual tax rate. The midpoint reflects a 32% increase over prior year EPS of $2.07. The guidance reflects the fourth quarter EPS range, which is unchanged of $0.67 to $0.71 to achieve the annual EPS outlook of $2.72 to $2.76.","Note that our year-to-date, EPS through the third quarter are $2.05, which includes the benefit of a lower tax rate due to the adoption of the new accounting standard. Although, we adopted this new standard in this year's second quarter, our year-to-date EPS of $2.05 also reflects a benefit of $0.04 attributable to the first quarter. This first quarter benefit will begin to be reflected in quarterly comparisons in 2017. We expect 2016 free cash flow to be around $400 million with our conversion rate of over 90%.","The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million; a full-year tax rate of approximately 29.5% with no benefit in the fourth quarter from the previously mentioned new accounting standard; the average fully diluted shares of approximately $158 million.","In summary, we're pleased with our performance so far this year and are set up for a strong 2017. The R&R market growth was softer than expected in the third quarter. But, recent trends and long-term fundamentals continue to point to solid demand and an elongated cycle.","Our disciplined focus on profitable growth is working well. As we are ahead of plan, and on track to hit our long-term operating margin goal of 15%, as the housing market reaches its long-term average. We remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian C. Lantz - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks on the third quarter of 2016. We will now begin taking questions. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I will ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good afternoon and congratulations on the five year milestone.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Chris, I think, you referenced to soft patch in demands, and I think, Lee provided some context about Canada being weak in Cabinets specifically. I was hoping you could spend a little bit more time talking about kind of the length of this soft patch and the duration of it? And it sounds like it was a transitory phenomena and you've seen demand pick up, so I was just trying to tie that in as we move towards year-end, what's giving you the confidence in the new guidance range based on the trends you've seen since the end of the quarter?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Sure. As we entered the third quarter, July is always quiet month, and so it was quiet, but in the past, we've had quiet Julys and things have picked up in August and September. This year as we kind of moved through August, it continued to be pretty flat. I'd say there was activity in pockets, but there were other places where it was kind of quiet.","Finally, as we got into second, third week of September, things started picking up, so in many ways, order patterns picked up and it was kind of too late to really drive third quarter. But since mid-September and through October, we're right back on our plans for where we thought the market would be, really across all of our businesses. And so you kind of look at it and you say, from what might have been kind of looking back mid-June through early part of September, we had a quiet R&R market. New constructions in this whole period kept rolling through. As we look at the data, I think builders put a lot of attention into completing the houses that were under construction. We come in, in the later stages of those homes, so to the extent we're delivering product into those homes, cabinet business, direct-to-builder, faucet business going in, doors business going in, that kept at a good pace.","It was just this R&R market was quiet. I can give you a little color, just in the channel feedback that we got, even for those who were out looking, they were getting feedback that to start a project now, there really wasn't the installation labor, carpenters, plumbers available until later in the fall. And so I don't know how much that ended up having to do with underlying activity. I'm sure some of it was the more basic drivers, consumer confidence, et cetera, but there was this feedback loop inside of our distribution that it was kind of telling folks that the activity that most of the contractors were booked up from the strong spring and so installers weren't really available.","That's freed up a bit. I'd still say there's some labor constraints out the market, but it's freed up a bit, and so I think that's passing through in some of the order activity that we see. I'd say that pretty consistent activity now through late September, October across all the businesses. So, that gives us the confidence to say we're going to come in where we thought we would in the fourth quarter. I've been calling this the Goldilocks year, first quarter a little bit hot, a little bit too hot, second quarter was kind of just right. Third quarter was a little bit cool, and it looks like fourth quarter is going to be kind of like second quarter, which is basically back on plan.","So altogether a good year. It's just kind of cycling up and down. Not unusual. This is my eighth year of running this business, our fifth year of being public and this whole recovery has had these kind of surges, flat spots, dips, and then kind of back up. So as a company, we're used to this. We staff accordingly. We kind of take the rolling view of it all. And so that gives us pretty good confidence coming into the end of the year, and frankly setting up 2017.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That makes a lot of sense. And, it's very encouraging looking into 2017. Just to Lee's comments about generating $400 million in free cash flow with the clean balance sheet. How do you make the decision internally between share buybacks and M&A? And what are you seeing on the M&A front in the current marketplace? Are you going on offense? What kind of opportunities are out there for GPG? Thanks and good luck.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks. Yeah. We remain focused on acquisitions. We are active and looking at a number of things. Obviously, we completed a couple of acquisitions on the luxury side of the plumbing market and we're excited about that fitting into the GPG. We continue to be busy looking at a number of other things in Plumbing, some things in Security, and then our other segments, and even looking at additional segments.","To the extent that the market is soft overall, we've shown that we've been opportunistic in buying back shares, summer of 2014, some weakness. And so, we took advantage of that, bought back $440 million of shares. Earlier this year, late January and February, some weakness in the market, we bought back $350 million or so shares. So to the extent there is soft spots, we'll take advantage of that but I still see some good opportunities in acquisition, so we'll balance those two between. We've said from the start, for the last five years, we're going to be efficient with our cash flow. We're not stockpiling cash. We're trying to be efficient for our shareholders to create value. And so that's kind of our mindset as we lean into this whole thing.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Hi, thank you, guys. Chris just to push a little further on this because it is pretty relevant to how people are thinking about the cycle and I think you put some good context around it. But if I back out the acquisition benefit, it looks like the guidance in the fourth quarter is basically sales growth of call it 4% to 7% versus 3% in third quarter. So can we interpret your comments to say that the quarter to date is essentially sort of in the midpoint of that 4% to 7% range?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, that's good math.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then the other thing that's kind of out there and just I don't think you touched on it, but sorry if I missed it. But promotions at retail on the cabinet side. What are you seeing and how are you guys behaving both at the home center channel and then the dealer channel?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. So, we've been more disciplined than the other larger guys who are in the retail channel. It's a smaller part of our business. It's only about 14% of our cabinet business. And so we've been measured. I think, we're third most aggressive of the three. So we have seen elevated promotions, but we've kind of picked our spots. I'd say, we were careful because we've got such a big dealer business, our in-stock business in vanities and in-stock kitchens. Those aren't promotional driven. So we don't really have to use promotions to drive volume. Maybe some others are more reliant upon it. And to the extent you're more active on the promotion side, it's going to deteriorate margins.","So, that's how we balance that. We're targeted, but as you can see from our margin improvements, we're not going that far into it, because we're driving that margin improvement across Cabinets. And, we're getting good utilization across our business coming out of dealer and coming out of in-stock. So, and direct-to-builder, where that business we've obviously readjusted that over time here, but that's a really attractive business. So, the context for it is, we're participating, but we're participating to a lesser extent. I guess, if the other guys want to go knock themselves out, they can. And for us, there is some business there that we like and that we're partnering with home centers around. But, we have a certain point that we're not comfortable going past.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","And then, on the dealer side, are you seeing elevated promotions versus a year ago there?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Much less so. That tends to be more targeted, I mean, really it gets down to almost the individual dealer and going after a single project. So, it's not programmatic as much as in the home centers, you kind of go nationally, you have to. But, within the dealer market, you can go very local and to the extent you see some attractive business chase it. So, no, that's not the same environment that we've seen on the home center side.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. Appreciate, Chris. Thanks, guys.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo of Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. First question is I guess, last quarter you had outlined your expectation for relatively benign commodity costs year-over-year in the second half of 2016. Any update on how you're thinking about the fourth quarter and perhaps into 2017?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yes, it's happening much as we outlined on the last call. We had said the first half would be more of a benefit, when you net commodity deflation or inflation against FX. So in the third quarter, we probably net picked up about a $0.01 from commodity less in FX impact. So \u2013 and in the fourth quarter probably a $0.01 or less, so much less of an impact in the second half, little more impact in the first half. 2017 if you look at commodities right now, it \u2013 they have not started to spike up, there are certain pockets, steel is little higher, glass has actually been higher all year, wood has been kind of breakeven right now, at this point. So not sure the pace right now, don't anticipate huge spikes right now, but we would assume that it would move up commodities \u2013 inflation would move up during the year.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the $2.5 billion Plumbing target for 2020, I guess, or curious, are you thinking that \u2013 are you targeting getting there organically or is there any way to dimension what percentage of that do you think would be attributable to acquisitions and would the acquisitions to the best of your view right now, include getting into other parts of kind of the value chain or other products in Plumbing?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. It's a combination, and it really strikes to the core of why we formed the Global Plumbing Group is, we think it's a combination of both organic and acquisitions, and there is a little loop in there where acquisitions then feed into faster organic growth. So our real strategy within Plumbing is to become more multi-branded, multi-product, a wider spectrum of price points. We've got really strong channel strength in our geographies across North America and China and we can put more through those channels, more brands, more volume, I'm more looking at other geographies. So, I'd say in terms of dimensioning it, you could say half of it through acquisition, half of it through organic. But, I'd say that's rough estimate, and certainly it's not anticipated to be all organic. And there could be even more upside if we're more aggressive on the acquisitions side.","So, it's all \u2013 in terms of putting that number out there, we're just trying to create an understanding, how we're looking at it, and frankly how significant it could be, just based on some of the things we're looking at and the power we see of bringing more through the channel strength that we've got, and leveraging the brands that we've got. Moen is obviously a huge brand, we think we can do more with it. We've acquired some additional brands, we think we're going to acquire some other brands. And so, it's just to create the expectation, and internally it's the way we're talking about, what the opportunity could be.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot, guys.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hey, guys. Good afternoon, nice job on the margins.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I guess just in the Cabinets business, I think that at least relative to our expectations, that the margins there have been a lot better this year versus maybe we thought initially. Could you talk about, I mean, this \u2013 just as we kind of think forward, I mean, is there \u2013 how do you feel about just capacity and the ability to kind of continue to expand margins at kind of that 25% to 30% incremental margin clip that you talked about historically?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. It's \u2013 thank you for that. And the credit goes to our team. We've got an outstanding operational team in our Cabinets business. It's an incredibly complicated business, you think about our spectrum of products that we're making from in-stock vanities through semi-custom, up to our more custom business. And these guys are really on the ball. So, if I break it down, we've got better operating efficiency going through the plants. We still have capacity, we made our big capacity investments a couple of years ago, they're just getting better at running it and we've frankly got more volume coming through, so that's part of it. Part of it is, we are getting some synergy benefit from Norcraft, you're seeing that come through, they've been aggressive in driving that and improving the operations of the acquired Norcraft businesses. And then some of it is just mix. As we've said, we target profitable growth in the market. We're not chasing every dollar of sales out there and within the relationships that we've got, we're driving a stronger mix. And that's coming through finishes, that's coming through more complicated projects and we spend a lot of time out in the field with the designers helping them really design the product into the \u2013 what the consumer is looking for and that yields a higher mix for us. So you take all those three things together and that team has really have been driving things together to improve that margin. We're headed toward mid-teens, that's what we've said, that business is capable of doing and we're well on track with that and team is focused on it and you'll continue to see improvement in 2017 and 2018 as we're moving up to that.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. No that's great. That's really helpful. I appreciate that. And then just thinking about mix, I mean, has there been \u2013 has \u2013 mix has been pretty strong over the last couple years, is there \u2013 have you seen any change in how the kind of breakdown of mix within your different businesses, has it changed at all or has it been pretty steady?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","It keeps improving. And I'd say, it's \u2013 I'd back to the consumer. I think, the consumer is really driving a lot of this. She is going for more painted looks, opaques, more complicated designs. And so, as we're fulfilling that need, it drives the mix up. I'd say it's that fundamental as long as we're on point with bringing out the products that she wants, then these \u2013 we're going to continue to see that mix drive through and it's within price tiers. So, if you go to vanities, the mix is improving in vanities. So, in-stock vanities which you'd say, oh, that's not a huge price point. Well, within that price point, the mix is improving up. In-stock kitchens, the mix is improving up. Value semi-custom, stronger mix in there, in our core semi-custom line, stronger mix in there.","So, it's kind of throughout the price points and parts of the business. I think, we're just trying to understand what's the consumer looking for and then if we can bring that into the market, work with the designers to say, here's what we've got, this is what your customers are looking for and you can execute on that, you can continue to drive that mix. And that \u2013 it's getting into a bit of the detail, but that \u2013 that's really what's going on inside of the channels and what's driving our mix improvement.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's great. I appreciate the color and good luck through the rest of the year here.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","(42:33) from a top-line perspective the last few quarter, what's driving the strength, and just it is you're looking to put more capital to work?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","You cut off in the first part of the question, if you could restate the question.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Sure. The Security business has been pretty strong from a top-line perspective the last few quarters. What's driving the strength? Is this a business you're looking to put more capital to work?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. They've been growing last couple of quarters. They had a particularly good quarter across the board. So, they were strong in retail, had a very good back-to-school season. So within padlocks, that's our big season for the year, they were good there, strong commercial performance kind of across the line, strong safes performance. We integrated the safe operation into both our Milwaukee operations, as well as down in Nogales, Mexico. We completed that over the summer, so it kind of freed up some management capacity. So, yeah, good consistent growth there. And we are looking at other opportunities to bring other products in, we've got very strong distribution on the retail and commercial side. We think our brands are strong, both the Master Lock and Sentry brands, and so it's an area of focus, we're working through that.","Frankly I didn't want to \u2013 we had to get the Sentry Safe integration done operationally, before I think we wanted to move too aggressively into other acquisitions than then had to be integrated. But we got through that milestone this summer, so I think we've freed up some management capacity, and we'll be excited to bring some more product in there. And so when we talk about our acquisition pipeline that's very much a part of that pipeline.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Sounds great. On margins, I mean, margins were strong across all your segments, but Doors as well that was pretty strong, what new initiatives are you putting in place to drive that improvement and is that type of margins sustainable? Thanks.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","I'd say that in the third quarter, the margin was 17%. We probably have a 100 basis points on that which were just some timing of expenses, which gets you down to 16%. I think the thing you're saying in net margin growth and it's been that way throughout the year is the structural advantages we have with the strength in wholesale that we establish two years to three years ago, especially on the West Coast. You also see that in the last 18 months a real thrust towards the retail and driving the retail side of the business, and that's driving those margins up. We get good leverage in that business, it's a lot like Cabinet. It's \u2013 you can really leverage those manufacturing assets well. That's what's happening. We would expect it to continue, when you think about, they finished the year last year with about a 10% operating margin, we think they'll be 12.5% this year, very much like Cabinets heading back to mid-teens margins at steady state, so them and Cabinets very similar in their margin growth and the same kind of potential to get there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola of Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hello.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","I wanted to kind of similarly ask the macro question, but more typically to your business in Canada, and I think I heard that Cabinets were down, but Plumbing was up, which I thought was interesting, so maybe anymore color around what you're seeing in Canada?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. So, that's a good question. Our Plumbing business is pretty well spread across the country, we've got real strength in the urban markets in Toronto, Vancouver, and so you're seeing continued strong activity in those markets. And we're picking up share to begin in those markets and so our Plumbing business performed quite well.","On the Cabinet business, we have real strength across the planes, we're in the urban markets, we also have strength across the planes and they are down. I mean, the Calgary oil industry has been hit, and so you're seeing some weakness there, so that hit our Cabinet business more so. And I think, they will continue to track to the market, we're certainly performing well relative to market, but to the extent that that impacts overall Canada our Cabinet business would be hit by that.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then hopping back over to Security here, more particularly on the margin performance, I think, you called out 100 basis points of benefit from expense timing, but even excluding that, margin performance was quite strong there. And so just wanted to see if you can help us think about the impact of the integration there, whether that is kind of running at full force at this point now and then if there were any other mix kind of considerations or the like?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","So, yes. It's running well. This integration is started to see the benefits of it, and Lee will give you some of the detail, but we're really excited about the fact that that's behind us and now you're starting to see it flow through the numbers.","E. Lee Wyatt - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","So, you're getting sales leverage clearly on the 6% sales growth. Chris talked about product mix improvement. I think that's a big part of it. All those duplicate cost from the last two quarters when we were integrating the Sentry Safe into our Nogales, those are pretty much gone now. So, I think you're now seeing that leverage. When we, a year ago, said that we were going to integrate the manufacturing, we set a target of a 15% operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2016. We said that will be the test that we've done a good job and we've got that integration done. And so, we're at the point now where we can say we'll have a 15% operating margin in the fourth quarter. We'll have a 14% for the full year as the margins built throughout the year, but we'll exit at 15% and that's a good starting point for next year.","Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC","Got you. Thanks for taking my questions.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hello.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions, it's Mike Rehaut.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hi, Mike.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. How are you, guys?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Good.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question, just on kind of revisiting the demand slowdown and obviously great to see the pick backup since mid-September. In terms of the slowdown, I think you kind of alluded to the fact that it kind of hit across most of your product categories, but were there certain end market or channel segments that you felt it more than others? I think you kind of referred to maybe some inventory adjustments. And as well as across any particular price point, as you kind of mentioned that the luxury line in your cabinets was down a little bit?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. So, I'd say it was soft in general. So, I'd say that was kind of consistent across. Having said that, I think Northeast was a little softer. South Florida is a little bit softer. Our luxury lines had run pretty hard the last two or three years on the cabinets in those markets, Northeast, South Florida. So, those are a little bit softer. I think we kind of felt it really across all the businesses. I don't know that I can, beyond that I don't know that it was that much different. And then you got a solid accelerate similarly kind of across the business. So it's hard to pinpoint anything more than that. It felt like a general market.","I don't know how to attribute it to underlying consumer demand, which I think was part of it. But also it felt like the whole system is a little bit backed up, that he ability for R&R activity to get started anew, when you've got a lot of project work coming in and we're fulfilling a lot of the activity coming out of the spring, the channels felt backed up. And again I can't be precise to say, well, how much was related to consumer, how much was related to the channel backed up. But it felt like it was a combination of both those things. That's why I kind of called them both out.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. No, no, no. That's helpful. And I guess just going back to mix for a moment as well, you kind of were very granular in saying that just it affect every product segment or product line let's say within your Cabinet business, in-stock, dealer, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Mix was positive. At the same time you did point out that your luxury lines were down, which would have everything else equal, a negative impact on mix. So just trying to get a sense from the top down if you just kind of, I don't know if you look at this way, but average sales price per cabinet, was that still a net positive despite?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, across the board, it was net positive. So in saying that the luxury end of the market was a little softer, it's relative to last year. But inside of that segment, we're still driving mix. So it's kind of like saying, in proportion as you say across all of these price points, if the very high end is a smaller proportion, that doesn't that hurt that mix, but with inside of those, you continue to drive mix, which is continuing to drive margin.","It's really kind of fundamental. It's Cabinets. It's also inside of Faucets. It's inside of Doors. When we talk about growing a little faster than the rest of the market by driving innovation, what we're really driving at is bringing new product in that's going to drive that mix up, and then working with the channels to allow them or to help them sell that mix through.","And that you can see it as I kind of go through average ASP by price point in Cabinets, it's coming through all those. If I look at the Plumbing division and look at Moen in our wholesale segment going into new construction, we're driving it from kind of spec to first upgrade, first upgrade to second upgrade. We continue to see that move up. In Doors, we're getting better attachment rates on glass, decorative glass, sidelights. And so we're driving that by bringing out new styles, so we're driving that mix up. And so when I talk generally about mix, it's kind of inside of those price points and inside of those categories, that's where all of our innovation work is going to drive that up.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. great. Thanks. And just one little quick one on the tax rate. Lee, fourth quarter you expected to go back to, what was it 33% or so, and any thoughts around next year?","E. Lee Wyatt - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. Nothing on next year yet, we'll give you that when we finish the annual plan. But yeah, about 33.5% in the fourth quarter, just to kind of clarify, when we gave guidance last quarter the $2.74 midpoint, we had assumed tax benefits in the second half of about $0.04 or so, and we kind of spread it by quarter $0.02 in the fourth quarter and $0.02 in the third quarter. What we saw this year was just the way the price of our stock has worked, being strong in the early part of the third quarter. We picked up $0.04 to $0.05 in the quarter. We'll pick up nothing we think in the fourth quarter. So we got the same kind of tax benefit that we would've thought, we just got it in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So pretty much as we'd expected. Next year we'll talk to you about our base rate is 33% or so, 33.5%, so but that's a starting point, but we'll have some planning ideas for next year and we'll give you a rate then.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. And your line is open.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi, thanks. Just wanted to dig in a little bit just on channel inventories in Plumbing, I think coming out of the second quarter, if I remember correctly, inventories were pretty lean and it sounds like because you provide a lot of commentary about how the system just got backed up in the third quarter, but if you could provide a little bit more color specifically what happened in Plumbing and also just the cadence as we look into the fourth quarter, if sell-in were to match sell-through.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, I would say, it's only the third quarter inventories in the channel continued to be lean, I think, you can see on the retail side, we actually called out that there was some further destocking, so in that channel on the retail side, I'd say you're running leaner than POS. So at some point we typically catch back up to that. On the wholesale side, didn't really see any improvements, so you're still running at POS there and so to the extent that the channel is pretty lean. As you see some surge in demand typically we have to ship back into that. So on the one hand it's helping, and on the other hand, it doesn't give us any help, it's bit of a headwind in the existing quarter, but you know that that's further demand that will come about as the market calls for. We've gotten good at servicing this business, so to certain extent, they're leaning on us and that's fine. That's part of our service proposition is we're just going to work hard to fulfill the orders when they come, but to the extent they can run a little leaner on inventory, they may take advantage of that. So, Lee, I don't know, if you want to add anything else?","E. Lee Wyatt - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. I think, what we're seeing across retail and wholesale customers in Plumbing is they're all working to be leaner on inventory whether it's systems implementations, other approaches, methods that they can use. We've seen that all year and which is a good thing for them and it's a good thing for us, it can be a little erratic quarter-to-quarter, but net-net, the demand we think is out there and that's going to drive, they'll drive the POS over time.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just a quick one on China. It seems like it bounced back this quarter after some choppiness in 2Q, I was just wondering if you can provide a little bit more explanation as to what helped with the improvement.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, China continues to perform well this year. I think, they've seen their real estate market perform well, beginning the year, the government put in place some things to try to help that market and those things are working. For us, we really saw it across the board, so importantly our Showroom business kind of the traditional retail business up strong double-digit, and that's a good sign, because that's both R&R, as well as going into new construction, so that was up strong, direct-to-builder continues to be okay, but surely kind of across the board, just healthy growth. A lot of it Tier 1, Tier 2, so I would say, looking back versus three years ago, where it was more kind of spread across Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4, a lot of the activity we're seeing now is more concentrated in those stronger better developed markets, which is again good, because we typically see a better mix coming through there, better price points coming through those Tier 1, Tier 2 markets. So for us China right now is a healthy market, we like that market.","Operator","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd now turn the call back over to Mr. Brian Lantz.","Brian C.

You may begin your conference call, sir.","Brian Lantz","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Fortune Brands Home & Security quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress during the second quarter of 2015. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release issued earlier.

Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll allow ample time to address any questions that you may have. I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. In the second quarter, our teams again delivered profit growth that was on plan in our home products market that improved modestly over the first quarter and prior year as we expected. Importantly, our core businesses are performing well across all segments, and we continue to build momentum in the market.","In the second half, our plan anticipates stronger market improvement driven by higher levels of new construction activity. Based on that market assumption, solid execution of our plan through second quarter and the momentum we have inside of our businesses, we\u2019re maintaining our full year outlook for our core business and updating the outlook for the Norcraft acquisition and interest expense from long-term financing.","Let me first spend time on our view on the home products market, and then I\u2019ll provide my perspective on our underlying business performance. Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market, in the second quarter the growth rate in the market for our home products improved modestly as we expected it would. We estimate that both repair and remodel and new construction grew approximately 5%. Due primarily to the timing of holiday starts, the market for our products should show stronger growth in the second half as our products go into homes in later stages of construction. Our overall assumption is that the U.S. home products market, which impacts 70% of our sales, grows at a combined 6% to 8% rate for the year.","Within that overall assumption, the pace of repair and remodel demand is assumed to grow at around 5% range. New home construction is assumed to grow 9% to 10% over 2014. The new construction activity over the next few months will give us a better sense of where within the full year range the market growth may fall.","Now watching closely to see what the positive impact on our sales in the fourth quarter might be and the pace of construction activity remains robust and extends into the normally quieter months of November and December.","Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the second quarter, sales increased 13% for the total company and 17% for the U.S. businesses. Importantly, operating income grew 20% and saw performance across all operating segments. Starting with our Cabinet segment, as I discussed on our last earnings call, we\u2019re following a disciplined strategy for cabinets with the goal of being the best cabinet supplier in North America. That the center of this strategy is our dedication to the designer as the key customer and our focus on the most attractive segments in the market. Cart innovation and our high-levels of reliable service to our channel partners drive growth.","The largest segment of the cabinet market is the dealer channel, which services more than half of the semi-custom cabinet market. We have the long-term structural competitive advantages that allow us to grow together with our over 5,000 dealer partners, including a regional supply chain for optimal service, multiple brands to avoid general conflict and the industry\u2019s best sales and service teams and a consistent flow of consumer-focused innovation.","In May, we acquired Norcraft cabinets, which fit perfectly into our strategy. Norcraft will help us build on our structural competitive advantages with their proven capabilities, great relationships with dealer channel and strong operating management throughout their business.","The combination will strengthen our overall product offering, while that our regional market penetration and enhance our [indiscernible] capabilities. With more overlap in our dealer channel customer basis, we see tremendous opportunity for accelerated growth by bringing these businesses together. And with this acquisition over half of our annual cabinet sales should come from this very attractive cabinet market segment. We are also sharply focused on profitable growth in home center in-stock cabinets and vanities. We plan to continue our strong growth in this market segment with our new product introductions and program wins, executed through our dedicated and increasingly efficient supply chain and logistics model.","Most importantly, our overall cabinet business is now solidly positioned in the most attractive segments of the market. 75% of our annual cabinet sales should be generated from the dealer channel and home center in-stock cabinets and vanities. These are not only the most profitable segments of the business, but are also where we have our strongest structural competitive advantages.","Turning to the second quarter of our cabinets. Our overall cabinet sales were up 18% over the prior year quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 20%. Sales for dealer and in-stock cabinets and vanities, which account for approximately 75% of our annual sales were up 29%. Specifically, sales in our largest channel dealers grew 32% and 10% excluding the Norcraft acquisition. Our share gains in this key channel are coming from deeper relationships with existing customers as well as new dealerships.","Our home center in-stock cabinets and vanity sales increased high teens due largely to the impact of new programs and product upgrades that we began shipping in the second quarter. We expect continued growth in the coming quarters from these new products and programs. The remaining 25% of our cabinets business focuses on the home center semi-custom, builder direct in select markets in our Canadian sales.","We are disciplined in our approach to the segments of the cabinet market as we focus on where we can capture profitable growth. Together these segments, we are up slightly in the quarter, but up mid-single digits when adjusted for Canadian FX.","Overall, for cabinets, our teams continuing to execute well across multiple facets of a complex category. Our recently expanded capacity is through the transition phase and our plants are increasingly more efficient. We are happy to have added this capacity and transition through its integration ahead of stronger market demand that we expect over the next couple of years.","On the frontend of the business, we\u2019re performing particularly well as we gain share on the most attractive segments of the market. The impact of our consistent execution can be seen in our share gains, our stronger mix and our improving margins.","To our Pluming segment, sales were up 5% for the quarter. Sales increased 10% in U.S. led by growth in both wholesale and retail. Again, in the second quarter, our mix was solid and margins were strong. Wholesale sales increased 5% with the pace of new construction and retail grew mid-teens driven by new product performance and strong POS. Channel inventories remain lean in wholesale with POS running ahead of shipments.","We are encouraged to see consumers trade up and continue to select our innovative new faucet shower products for their new homes and repair and remodel projects, including new pullout and pull down faucets with reflex self-retraction in our notch and [ph] boss lines, our Wynford traditional bath suite and magnetics easy docking, easily re-leasing shower heads.","Sales in Canada were down double digits to the prior year, but were nearly flat when you exclude the impact of currency. China sales declined 4% versus the prior year due to slower direct-to-builder activity. However, retail and e-commerce generated mid-single-digit growth, as we continue to focus our marketing efforts at the local city level and increased store network productivity. We remain optimistic about both our long-term business model in China and the growth potential and are encouraged by the R&R activity that we\u2019re beginning to see.","Doors reported sales were up 6% for the quarter. Door products saw sales growth driven by gains in both new construction and retail. Mix continued to improve with consumers more frequently, choosing our decorative glass designs and responding to our new styles, like our recently launched Pulse line of modern entry doors. The Therma-Tru brand continues to perform strongly across all channels and we\u2019re benefiting from our expanded distribution.","In the Security segment, sales increased 28% from the prior year quarter with U.S. sales up 37%. Sales from the SentrySafe acquisition drove the growth while Master Lock sales increased 3% in U.S. driven by retail and safety. FX and international softness a little bit offset the U.S. growth. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities we see between our Master Lock and Sentry businesses over the next few years and the teams are working hard to integrate the operation.","So to sum up, the second quarter was better than the first quarter and we continue to expect the second half to be stronger than the second quarter. Our teams are executing well and delivering profit results on plan.","Before I wrap up, I\u2019d like to comment on our efforts to use our cash flow and balance sheet to drive incremental long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend.","I\u2019m excited that Nick Fink has joined us in our newly created role of senior vice president of global growth and development. He brings a wealth of development experience and is a proven operator. He is joining us at a very good time as the acquisition pipeline is the most robust we\u2019ve seen since before the downturn. Over the next three years, we believe we have the potential to deploy an additional $2 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value.","So to sum up, 2015 is progressing as we expected. We remain confident in our ability to continue to outperform the home products market, our core businesses are strong and we remain well-positioned to deliver solid growth in 2015, and even more growth beyond 2015 as the housing market continues its recovery. We also continuing to believe that our strong brands, management teams, and capital structure provides flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. We\u2019ve begun to build significant momentum, and we have the ability to create incremental value at an accelerated pace.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our updated guidance.","Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations. Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $1.17 billion, up 13% from a year ago and as Chris mentioned, sales increased 17% for our U.S. businesses. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $151 million, up 20% or $25 million compared to the same quarter last year. EPS were $0.59 for the quarter, versus $0.51 for the same quarter last year, and we\u2019re on plan for the second quarter and first half of the year.","Let me now provide more color on segment results. Our cabinet sales were $551 million, up $83 million or 18% versus the prior year quarter. Norcraft added $46 million of the sales growth. Dealer sales were $253 million, an increase of 32% from the prior year. In-stock cabinets and vanities sales of $136 million, increased high-teens, reflecting shipments to support new product wins. The remaining sales for our home center, semi-custom, builder direct in Canada, increased 4% excluding the negative impact of $5 million from Canadian currency.","Operating income for the cabinet segment increased 23% or $11 million over the prior year quarter, with Norcraft adding $5 million of the increase. Operating margin for the quarter increased to 10.3%. For the full year, we continue to expect to add over 100 basis points to the prior year operating margin of 7.7% and approach it to 9%.","Turning to the Plumbing. Sales for the second quarter were $358 million, up $18 million or 5%, led by U.S. retail up mid-teens and U.S wholesale up 5%. Excluding the negative impact of currency, total plumbing sales increased 7%. Canadian sales were flat, excluding the negative impact of $5 million from Canadian currency and China sales were 4% lower.","Operating income increased $5 million to $75 million, up 7%. Operating margin for the segment was 21%, up 40 basis points from the prior-year quarter. For the full-year 2015, operating margin should be close to 20%. Door sales were $118 million, up $7 million or 6% from the prior-year quarter.","Operating income increased $6 million to $15 million, up 57%. Operating margin for the segment was 12.9%, up 410 basis points from the prior-year quarter. Full-year operating margin for this segment should approach 9%, a significant improvement over 7.1% the prior year.","Security sales, which now include SentrySafe, were $139 million in the second quarter, up 28% to the prior year. The impact of foreign currency reduces sales by $3 million in the quarter. Segment operating income increased 41% to $20 million and the operating margin increased to 14.3%. To sum up consolidated second-quarter performance, sales increased 13% and EPS were on plan at $0.59.","With our total company operating margin at 12.9%, we are on track to reach our long-term goal of 14% plus operating margin, when the housing market returns to steady state levels. Before turning to the balance sheet, let me comment on the cumulative impact of currency. A strengthening U.S. dollar reduced our total second quarter sales by approximately $14 million with Canada being the primary source, the EPS impact was approximately $0.01.","Turning to the balance sheet, in June, we took advantage of the opportunity to secure long-term financing by issuing $900 million in corporate bonds. Our solid business model, consistent cash flow, and strong balance sheet supported both the investment grade ratings received from all three agencies, and a favorable long-term rates realized. The refinancing was leverage neutral and the bonds have traded well since their issuance.","Importantly, with the proceeds used to pay off our $975 million revolver, we will have significant financial flexibility to drive incremental growth. Our June 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $224 million, debt of $1.39 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 2.1 times. By year-end, we expect leverage to be about 1.5 times. We currently have nothing drawn on our $975 million revolving credit facility.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2015. Based on our projected 6% to 8%, U.S. home products market growth, the assumptions we make for our other markets, and continued share gains, plus the Norcraft acquisition, we expect full year 2015 sales to increase 13% to 15% compared to 2014. Our updated outlook 2015 EPS, which now includes the impact of the Norcraft acquisition as well incremental interest expense as a result of our bond issuance, calls for EPS in the range of $2.03 to $2.10. Our updated outlook reflects market assumptions similar to our prior outlook, plus $0.04 to $0.05 from Norcraft, net of interest and amortization, less $0.02 from incremental interest expense from refinancing the non-Norcraft debt, less approximately $0.01 from the additional impact of foreign currency.","We expect 2015 free cash flow to be around $270 million, after expected CapEx of a $135 million. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions. Interest expense of $32 million, a tax rate of 32.5% and average fully diluted shares of approximately $163 million.","In summary, the second quarter EPS was on plan in an improving market. The [indiscernible] core business, the recent investments made to increase capacity, and steps taken to reposition our portfolio for stronger growth, as well they expected continuing market recovery gives us confidence and continued solid growth in the coming years.","As demonstrated by the Norcraft acquisition, we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value with the new debt structure giving us significant flexibility.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks on the second quarter of 2015. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue if time allows. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I\u2019ll ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then re-enter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall","Hey. Good afternoon and congratulations on a very solid quarter. Hey, Chris, I was hoping you could take a moment and just give us a little bit more granularity, what\u2019s giving you confidence in the guidance, you\u2019re moving up the bottom end to the range, what are you seeing from the demand side that\u2019s giving you comfort to be aggressive about your outlook for profitability?","Christopher Klein","Thanks Bob. Obviously two parts of the market on the R&R side, we just continue to see a good steady cadence. Our new construction, really we look at a lot of factors and looking out throughout the year. At this stage, most of what we\u2019re looking at is showing positive. So, we\u2019re looking at drivers of new family demand, household formation, employment, wages and we look at actual activities. We look at the order books of the builders which turn into permits \u2013 so the permit data, purchase financing applications and then you move on to starts and we clearly going to [ph] culminate in closings.","If you run that whole sequence out, a lot of what we\u2019re seeing is setting up a strong second half. And I just draw a parallel to some prior periods where we look at this data and saw the similar patterns and kind of the second half of 2009, which set up a strong fourth quarter and first half of 2010 for us.","The second half of 2011, which was when we came out as an independent company, all those indicators indicated a strong demand coming at us and 2012, 2013 saw some good demand. And we\u2019re going to looking at the same sort of factors right now. I\u2019d say the only caveat, labor looks pretty tight and obviously there was some wet parts of the country, which probably saw some building activity, but everything else we\u2019re looking at, looks very positive. So, we had a year I\u2019d say a little bit more conservative than the market, we were below consensus in terms of our own internal view, and the market has got to come into us. So all that lines up or what we think is going to be pretty good growth in the second half, and we\u2019re performing well in all of our segments.","Robert Wetenhall","It\u2019s \u2013 thanks, it\u2019s very helpful. Second question and then I\u2019ll pass it over. Could you just talk for a second about what your thoughts are about the M&A pipeline that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, what are you seeing in terms of segments where you would like to invest in, how do you see evaluations today and kind of what\u2019s the pipeline thinking from a timeframe for Fortune to start deploying its balance sheet? Thanks very much and good luck.","Christopher Klein","Yeah. I guess, I\u2019d say it\u2019s really picked up over the last four months, five months, a lot of stuff coming at us, inbound. We\u2019ve also had a lot of outbound activity which has resulted in some interesting discussions. I can never speculate on whether any of these result in a successful transaction, but I\u2019d say the pace of activity is stronger than we\u2019ve seen since before the downturn. And looking across our segments, a lot of discussions in plumbing, some discussions in security, some discussions in the exterior part of the home, and some international discussions.","So I\u2019d say all of that is going to moving through us right now, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s notable, it\u2019s much stronger than it had been. What\u2019s driving it, I guess, I think there was quite a bit of pent-up transaction out there and as sellers look at the market and that\u2019s been unfolding in a fairly systematic way, and expecting a huge pop that\u2019s going to realize in something extraordinary. So it sets up a pretty good dynamic. I\u2019d say in terms of valuation expectations are coming more inline as well which is buyers and sellers getting a little bit closer which is probably what\u2019s leading to the transactions that are happening out there.","So obviously we did Norcraft 11. 5 times EBITDA but strong growth characteristics and I\u2019d say that\u2019s typical, paying that range if you got strong forward growth that you can count on that isn\u2019t juts speculative, but it\u2019s concrete based on the trajectory of the businesses and good margin profiles and I think we\u2019re in an environment where you can probably calculate those has some confidence in and so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Nice job.","Christopher Klein","Thank you.","Tim Wojs","I guess just focusing just on the cabinet\u2019s business in the back half of the year I guess coming back to look at Q2 and we take our Norcraft, I\u2019m getting kind of $5 million EBIT improvement in the core business and maybe that translates to low to mid-teens incremental and so could you just talk a little bit about what gives you the confidence in the back half of the year just given the pretty substantial EBIT ramp that I guess is implied in guidance?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah. This is Lee. I characterize a couple of pieces here. One is the market that Chris talked about that\u2019s as we expected continuing to improve both in new construction and R&R, on top of that, when you think of sales just even excluding Norcraft and you look at our second half comps last year, our cabinet sales in the second half last year were basically flat and Moen actually was only up less than 4% in the second half. So, we\u2019ve got pretty nice comps to go against in the second half of this year. So we feel good about that on the sales line and then we just got the normal growth on top of that that comes from this market.","On the profit side, in terms of cabinets, you remember, we moved quickly in the second half of last year to put capacity into cabinets, getting ahead of the demand that we saw over the next few years and that cost us significant inefficiencies and we actually in the third quarter called out $7 million of inefficiencies and then we called out $12 million in the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019ve had those that will not be there this year. So when you start adding back those inefficiencies, and then you add the incremental sales at kind of a reasonable incremental operating margin, you kind of get to nice growth and that\u2019s \u2013 so it\u2019s a combination of all those things. Basically it\u2019s a combination of the market improving as we\u2019d expected, it\u2019s a combination of weaker comps on the sales line and just continuing to improve that profitability, especially in cabinets where we had some one-time items last year.","Tim Wojs","Okay, great, now and that\u2019s helpful. Thanks Lee. And then, just on the investments that you guys had earmarked for this year, can you just remind us the pace of that in the first quarter versus the back half and if that\u2019s going according to plan?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah, so remember in 2014 just to frame it, we had about $0.12 in investments primarily in cabinets around those capacity ads in the second half. In 2015, we talked about $0.07 to $0.08 of investments, and right now we\u2019re thinking at probably around the $0.07 range. Moen would be a little more than half of that, probably $0.045 of the $0.07 for the year. As we think about the timing by quarter, we think we had about $0.01 in each of the first two quarters, probably have $0.02 in the third quarter and $0.02 to $0.03 in the fourth quarter, as we really ramp up some of that Moen capacity in both the North American assembly and in the China manufacturing. So about $0.07 for the year, $0.02, $0.025 in the first half, $0.045 to $0.05 in the second half and all built into our forecast.","Tim Wojs","Right. Great. Thank you.","Lee Wyatt","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Thank guys. Strong results.","Christopher Klein","Thank you Stephen.","Stephen Kim","Wanted to \u2013 yeah, first question, I guess is related to the comments about the strength in housing, we certainly have seen some figures had been pretty good, coming out of builders in terms of top line or orders I would say, but we\u2019ve also seen absorptions per community there kind of coming in more flattish for a lot of the guys.","In addition with the recent little move up in rates, there\u2019s also been some concern about, how that\u2019s going to be affecting demand going forward. And I was just curious is to what degree, some of those more offsetting factors have been incorporated into your outlook. If you could just sort of talk a little bit about, why those factors particularly the lack of absorption growth that the builders would suggest that they\u2019re just gaining share of the market as opposed to the overall market and I would think you would care more about the overall market than the builders gaining share?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. I guess I\u2019m just looking at the \u2013 even near end, looking at second half, you just look at permits and starts, orders are still pretty strong even with the absorption issue, we see a pretty good pipeline across our customer base and it\u2019s not just the data we\u2019re looking at an aggregate, it\u2019s also discussions with the large builders that we support through Moen in large parts as well as Therma-Tru and it kind of lines up to what our expectations are. I\u2019d also say there are expectations are slightly below where consensus is. So as we\u2019re talking about where our growth is for our products coming in with a slight lag to the actual construction. What\u2019s embedded in our guidance, assumes slightly less than consensus new construction numbers. So we\u2019re not really kind of stressing out there, as we\u2019re looking at the balance at this year.","As we look into 2016 and 2017, we create a wider range because frankly we\u2019re doing this to plan capacity to plan inventory to do those sorts of things. And so at that point we\u2019ll probably look more like consensus in the 2016, 2017 range, just because that we need a wider range to plan around. So I\u2019d say, there is no great leads of faith in the second half of the year, it\u2019s based on data we\u2019re looking at, discussions we\u2019re having in the market, the activity that we see. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s just \u2013 I guess it\u2019s also the preponderance of green versus yellow versus red in terms of all of the score cards I\u2019m looking at and where the indicators are, I\u2019m seeing a lot more green than I\u2019m yellow or red, so.","Stephen Kim","Great. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess the second question, if you could talk about the competitive dynamics or the competitive environment in cabinet as particularly, there\u2019s been some conversation about maybe the pricing environment, promotional environment getting better in cabinets. I was wondering if you provide a little more granularity around what you\u2019re seeing in that segment? Thanks.","Christopher Klein","Sure. So for us I guess, half of our sales are going into the dealer channel. I guess pretty fragmented markets, not a lot of systematic promotions going on in that segment, you\u2019ll see it from time-to-time, and we might do things in a certain region, but it\u2019s a pretty stable environment.","On the home center side, in terms of special order, semi-custom that\u2019s the probably the most intensive side of promotional activities historically. It can cycle up or down in the quarter. Our approach has been to be pretty disciplined in there and we retained that approach so that we\u2019re instead investing in new products, new programs, which we have had success with at the home centers and that\u2019s worked well for us. So for us, in terms of our exposure on the competitive side to promotions, it\u2019s increasingly a smaller and smaller part of our overall business.","The in-stock business is not promotional driven, so we\u2019re going to have vanities or in-stock kitchens, that\u2019s not subject to what you hear about us promotional. So it really is just a small portion today as we sit here and we\u2019ll manage it the way we managed it really for the last three years, which is to be disciplined and focus on the things, the designer really appreciates and the consumer values in terms of innovation and just supporting everybody with great service and that seems to work for us and we\u2019re going to stick to that.","Stephen Kim","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","Christopher Klein","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to go back to the last comment quickly, I guess, to be clear, were you seeing increased promotional activity in the semi-custom business, I guess the profitability wasn\u2019t quite as strong as we would have expected in the quarter, but it looks like you\u2019re expecting the back half to still be decent. So was there any promotional activity, was it a mix thing or were there still some of the \u2013 some of the lingering expenses related to the investments coming through in the second quarter?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. It was really more, still some of the lingering investment although we\u2019re through that from an efficiency standpoint certainly in the early part of the quarter that was still moving through. There was some promotional activity, but I\u2019d say given the part of the market that that\u2019s occurring in, not a big factor. So I think second half leverage as we walk through certainly will improve. I think from an overall OI margin 10.3%, we haven\u2019t seen anything over 10% since 2008. So we\u2019re making good progress in terms of kind of building that margin in the second half certainly expect we\u2019re going to continue on that track. I think from an efficiency standpoint, plants are running well.","We got through what we invested in last year and as we highlighted last year, lead time you\u2019re increasing capacity inside of a plant, it\u2019s going to be disruptive and that was expected and we work through it and now we\u2019re starting to deliver against that. So you\u2019ll definitely see stronger leverage coming through second half and into next year.","We are just too kind of talk about mix a little bit on the cabinet side. Surprisingly the higher end of the market continues to perform really well. So our higher price points are selling strong and I think that just for those out there who have real investment interest in their homes and are doing bigger on our projects, they are spending on more premium price points, which is pretty healthy and all that\u2019s coming through the dealer channel.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then I guess shifting to plumbing, there was a comment that POS is selling faster than shipments and inventories continue to be lean, are you seeing any signs or having any conversations with the customers around when you could see an inflection point in that?","Christopher Klein","Yeah, it\u2019s been kind of trickling down, so POS for wholesale is around about 8% for Moen, and sales up 5%. I think what we see at this time of the year, here in July, nobody is going to make big commitments at this point. Typically, what we see is in August, if their expectation is that they\u2019re going to need support, more demand and so we could start to see some inflection in ordering patterns. So, we\u2019ll watch it, sometimes it kicks in August, sometimes in September and then that will support the balance of the year. So, I view it as a pretty healthy in that and that door is out there, and the channels are leaner as demand starts to build, we respond pretty quickly and we\u2019ll just ship into the demand as it comes. So services, I guess, our customers are relying upon that and we have a good service to build and support that and we\u2019ve been delivering on that in the past. So, that\u2019s pretty rationale for them to do is to manage it and start it as possible as they can.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Thanks and good luck.","Christopher Klein","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zener","Afternoon gentlemen.","Christopher Klein","Hi.","Kenneth Zener","My one question is going to be about on cabinets. Obviously Norcraft adds different element to your business and they were kind of higher end, if you could talk to the difference on perhaps how much price\/mix is part of your organic growth rate and\/ or Norcraft\u2019s, is that that was the contributing element for them? And second, if you could just comment on WoodCrafters, you obviously talked about the \u2013 that part of the market being less promotional. So, is that business on track with the EBIT margins that you did expected when you acquired it? Thank you.","Christopher Klein","No, on the Norcraft side, the Norcraft business mix actually looked a lot like our dealer business. So there are Mid-Cont, which is got a good kind of mid price point, looks a lot like ALK in the bottom end of our semi-custom business. And then there are higher price point brand, looks like some of our price point [ph] brand, so pretty good overlay. And they have that pricing power in the market. I\u2019m in a good margin structure. So I would say, it will fit nicely, into the dealer side of the market, but it really kind of looks very similar to what we have before.","The big opportunities we talked about last time is there\u2019s very little overlap in terms of dealer customer base. So only about 25% overlap, which means we can take [above it that we\u2019re selling into our dealer network and move it into those dealer customers required with Norcraft. And then take their products, especially similar frameless products and move into our dealer base.","So that work is started, just a terrific company, great management, great associates, only good surprise is to this point and you like to say that on our acquisition, is only good surprise to sell. So far it\u2019s been a just a terrific experience in \u2013 we\u2019re pretty optimistic about that. On what factors, yeah. That the \u2013 if you look at, that kind of the in stock camp business which we were involved, before WoodCrafters and then the WoodCrafters business and then other vanity business that we were in as well. We roll that all together, significant part of our business now 27% plus and it\u2019s really dependent upon the operating efficiency of the business. So we have dedicated plans, of the Mexico as well as in the U.S. and so operating those wing plant structures to support that business, focus on logistics, so we can support our customers there.","And kind of good efficient logistics, business system just remembering innovation, such a pretty tight business and again not a lot of promotion, their share price point. We\u2019ve got good low cost base of manufacturing and support, and logistics to that business. So it\u2019s a really good business model, we got a lot of sustainable competitive advantage inside of that business model and that\u2019s what makes it attractive there.","Lee Wyatt","And I think part of the question was has Woodcraft performed as we thought it would, yes it has. In fact, we\u2019ve expanded operations down to Mexico, part of the investment we made last year was to expand out big facility in Mexico and we\u2019re making components now for some of our other North American operations out of those plants and ramping up so, it\u2019s not just kind of the woodcraft or product but rather the component that feeds a big part of our other cabinet business, which supplements some component suppliers out of China, which we still have but certainly like the balance between China and Mexico just running on China for that.","Kenneth Zener","Thank you.","Lee Wyatt","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Ryan Hunter","Hi, this is actually Ryan Hunter filling in for Mike. First question, in terms of cabinets and Norcraft, has there been any early feedback from new potential cabinet dealers that you could pick up to your expanded product portfolio, so how quickly is the rollout from bringing Norcraft product into your existing channel and vice-versa?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. Feedbacks like that I think people said wow two best cabinet companies just got together. So I think that\u2019s always good to hear from our customers is that they like us both and they\u2019re happy we are working together and as a team are in the process now of kind of rolling through, first targeting where those cross-sell opportunities will be and then working with our customers. So our expectation is that you\u2019re really going to see the impact of that in 2016 and 2017, even in 2018, but certainly you\u2019ll see some impact in 2016, I\u2019d say we can\u2019t do some right now [indiscernible] . We really didn\u2019t expect that would flow through. The cost side in terms of synergies, purchasing synergies just overall the efficiency side of that, we\u2019ll see some of that this year and then into next year. So, everything is on track. As I said before, only good news is going to coming out of where we see the opportunities and we\u2019re excited about it a couple of months into it.","Ryan Hunter","Great. And then one question on plumbing. Industrial companies have broadly seen a slowdown in China recently, are you guys seeing any impact on your China plumbing business, and what\u2019s happening with the profitability at stores in China, and the pace of new store openings?","Christopher Klein","So, China, yeah, the direct to builder business has slowed and really we\u2019re starting to seeing that late last year. On the other side, our stores business, which is we\u2019ve got about 1,000 stores there, and that business combined with our e-commerce business, which is actually growing is still positive. So that\u2019s kind of the core of the business. The direct to builder sometimes is in favor, out of favor and then that market overall can fluctuate obviously as construction does.","The dynamic is, a lot of these units are built without plumbing finished in them. So as people go to occupy previously built unit that could have been built a year or two years or five years or more years ago, they are needing to come to these home product malls into our stores to shop for their faucet, their showers, their sinks, their vanities and so that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving that part of the business. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re encouraged that\u2019s holding up okay.","From a profitability standpoint, not a big hit. As we\u2019ve said in the past, profitability in China is less than where is North America because we\u2019ve been in an investment mode. So to the extent that sales are a bit slower, it doesn\u2019t really impact the profitability and obviously strong margins once again at Moen of 21% of operating margins obviously not overly impacted by anything going on China. So...","Ryan Hunter","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. First question, I just wanted to circle back to your comments around acquisitions and certainly helpful in terms of the some of the directional comments, but it seems like if I go back two years or three years, it seems like your thoughts around acquisitions at that time was more talking in terms of let\u2019s say moderately sized type of targets and that\u2019s by and large, the types of the companies that you\u2019ve acquired in terms of WoodCrafters, SentrySafe, Norcraft in terms of the sales.","By your tone and comments given, you\u2019re talking around the increased level of more robust pipeline and kind of even talking about exterior home and international, and we\u2019d also think that perhaps the size of the deals could also increase and related to that when you talk about exterior home, is that something beyond doors or more sticking around just the doors, in another words, will there be kind of another leg to the stool that you would add from a product portfolio standpoint?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. So I\u2019d say, we have consistently looked at in the size of acquisitions from small tuck-in $20 million, $30 million in sales up to much larger things that we could make the numbers work sort of locked away. I think, as you reflect correctly here, we\u2019ve kind of been successful in the middle. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re still looking at that wide range and so I think, you could see us do some small things and medium things and there maybe some big out there. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re just pretty disciplined about it and so the accretion needs to work, the value accretion for shareholders needs to work and that\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t waiver from that. So we stepped away from simply in the past and just haven\u2019t met that test, but obviously it doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t pay a full price, and I think we did for Norcraft because of certainty of where we saw the growth and where we saw the margins.","In terms of adding another leg in the assisted category, yeah, we\u2019ve looked at that from time-to-time and continue to look at that in terms of exterior, has to really involve the consumer. So, we don\u2019t want to move into anything that is commodity like just because we\u2019re not \u2013 that\u2019s not our business, it doesn\u2019t mean those aren\u2019t good business, that\u2019s just not where we\u2019re strong, as we\u2019re strong as where there is heavy consumer involvement and where innovation really gets paid for and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been successful with the businesses that we\u2019ve got so. So, any of those categories that would have those characteristics we\u2019re looking at and it doesn\u2019t mean something might happen, but yeah we look at those from time-to-time and also interior of the house we look at some categories where has those characteristics, but heavy consumer involvement is probably the biggest thing that we focus on.","So, yeah, I\u2019d just say that the activity in terms of number of things we\u2019re looking at is picked up, and that\u2019s what\u2019s really remarkable is it kind of got busy the first quarter and it\u2019s kind of not let up, and I can never predict how many things will get done, because you never know where expectations are, but I just say that more things you look at typically the higher the probability of getting something done.","Michael Rehaut","I appreciate that. Thanks, Chris. And just a couple of technical questions, modeling related, if you could just kind of review with us \u2013 if you continue to think maybe roughly speaking what corporate expense, how we should think about that for the full year. And also as you talk about the $32 million for full year interest, I guess that implies a quarterly run rate in the back half of around 11% to 11.5%, and if that something that we should extrapolate into 2016?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah. This is Lee. So I think for what I would do on a quarterly basis for corporate, I think the run rate is around $16 million, I would use that from the last two quarters. And on interest, we had a partial interest, a partial quarter in the second quarter of interest. So I\u2019d say each of the second quarters of the second half I\u2019d have overall interest expense around $11 million or so a quarter, getting to $32 million in total.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois","Well, hi, thank you. Just had a question on the in-stock and vanity in cabinet channel saw that occurred in the second quarter. Just wondering if that is completely around this course sort of is any of that bleeding into the third quarter? And then also, if you look at the second half of the year, you\u2019ve called out \u2013 and you have been calling up for a couple of quarters now, incremental expenses particularly in plumbing. Are there any other onetime items whether it\u2019s from a channel full perspective or from an additional cost perspective that we should be aware of?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. I\u2019ll take the first which is on kind of the vanity and in-stock loading to support new products that we\u2019ve lunched as well as the new programs, that was really pretty heavy second quarter, and it\u2019ll continue into third quarter, we\u2019ll then get into a replenishment cycle. The programs are doing pretty well, so you could see some good growth coming out. So I think you\u2019ll see some support on that third quarter as well as kind of continuing in next year as those are successful. And then I think we \u2013 once we protect the second half.","Lee Wyatt","Yeah and in terms of the second half any \u2013 the question is any incremental one-time expenses, I really don\u2019t see any. We talked in a previous question about the investments being $0.07 EPS for the year and 4.5% or 5% of that in the second half. Other than that, nothing that\u2019s we\u2019re talking about and calling anyone\u2019s attention to.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow up question on the door segment. Just wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit more context around margins and the expectation for margin expansion moving forward?","Lee Wyatt","Yeah. So, doors, you have to remember doors are 13% to 14% operating margin business when we hit steady state. So they were 7.1% last year, full year. We think, they\u2019re heading to 9% or 9% plus even in 2015 for operating margin. So they\u2019re getting on that progression to get back to that 13% to 14% when we get to steady state. So that\u2019s positive, that\u2019s what we planned.","If you look specifically at the quarter, it\u2019s just a combination of things that allow them to go up the 400 plus basis points. It\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re getting nice sales growth which gives them leverage on their fixed costs, that\u2019s a big piece of it, they\u2019re getting very nice mix \u2013 that\u2019s a piece of it. They\u2019re getting some price in the industry, so that\u2019s a piece of it. All those things kind of add together to kind of keep them getting on that trail to getting back to that 13% to 14% operating margin and 9% plus this year.","Garik Shmois","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Barrett from CL King & Associates. Your line is open.","James Barrett","Good afternoon everyone.","Christopher Klein","Hi.","James Barrett","Chris, could you talk a bit, you mentioned acquisitions in pluming, security, exterior products, is it possible to rank those categories in terms of the number of strategic competitive bidders you likely to have in those categories or is that too difficult to gauge?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. I mean it\u2019s very situational by any target that we\u2019re looking at or anything if there is obviously an auction process around a particular company then you are going to see both strategics and private equities involved in kind of a more robust process, if it\u2019s something that we might have been working on because of just being in these industries and then having good discussions with folks over period of time then it\u2019s a less competitive environment. So it\u2019s hard to break it out between the different segments because it\u2019s just really more situational of any individual company if it\u2019s going to be a company held by maybe a private equity owner, it might be more than auction process, if it\u2019s a situation where we\u2019ve been just talking about what we could do strategically with a certain privately held company or otherwise then that probably limits the number of folks involved.","The final caveat is it\u2019s a competitive world out there and it is something like Norcraft where it\u2019s a public transaction typically in those cases there\u2019s what we had which is a go shop precession and then they go scout the world to see they can do better and they got competitive and have good strategic rationale for what you\u2019re doing and then hopefully you\u2019re successful on those things. So, I\u2019d say they\u2019re just a lot of different things that are particular to the given situation and I just come back to the bigger the pipeline the better opportunity we got because of some many individual factors.","James Barrett","Okay and then finally international geographies of any that are particular interest and specifically could you comment on how interested you are in China expanding Moen plumbing?","Christopher Klein","Actually, there are many opportunities in China in plumbing and beyond, but I think it would have to be in the category [indiscernible] we\u2019ve got in terms of distribution I think, being in the bathroom and adjacent categories make sense, being in the kitchen makes sense. Going into other parts of the home in China, feel lot tougher just because we don\u2019t have natural distribution relationships or even from a supplier standpoint, just kind of learning maybe a [ph] topic of learning, so I think there\u2019s other opportunities looking at things over there and so it\u2019s probably more than adjacencies to where we are today.","James Barrett","Thank you very much. That was helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Coppola from Thompson Research. Your line is open.","Nicholas Coppola","Good afternoon.","Christopher Klein","Hello.","Nicholas Coppola","In the Cabinet segment, are you seeing any change in the competitive environment particularly and sales and new construction?","Christopher Klein","No, I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably the same as it\u2019s been for the last four quarters. I think we and a couple of others have really deemphasized some parts of the country where it was tough to have profitable business. So, some of the southwestern markets from a builder direct standpoint were just tough to make profitable, and so I think that was going on with us and with some of our competitors as well, and it\u2019s been deemphasized. That\u2019s probably the biggest changing dynamic, otherwise I think we\u2019ve picked our spots in the market by geography and by relationship, where we\u2019ve got good contractor builder relationships and we focused on those and we are doing well there. And I think others are really going after other parts of the market. So we take a pretty good disciplined approach on that builder direct side of the business. Then there is the other part of business, we are serving builders through our dealer network and yeah, I don\u2019t know that competitive environment there has changed that much.","Nicholas Coppola","Okay, that makes sense. And then just my last question here, again on in cabinet, what did you see throughout Q2 just in terms of raw material pricing?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. So, second quarter is similar to first quarter, overall inflation fairly flat, commodity inflation very flat. In the first half and the second quarter, we did see some of the wood products still having some inflation, particleboard being one and certain other smaller segments, we saw some inflation in a lower single-digits. We saw some categories like brass and copper, where we saw slight reductions, but it all nets out to the quarter being basically flat for us versus last year.","Nicholas Coppola","That\u2019s my questions, guys.","Christopher Klein","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis McGill","Hi, thank you. Chris, just first question, I guess, on the revenue side, holding guidance for the full year, can you just talk to how the second quarter played out as you expected? Was there the same amount of momentum through the quarter that you saw at the beginning that quarter or is there more of this come in the second half of the year than previously?","Christopher Klein","No, I think it was pretty consistent with what we thought at the start of the second quarter was a little weaker and we saw some building momentum throughout the quarter. So as we come into the third quarter, we feel pretty good about, where we\u2019re seeing order patterns today [ph] branded it\u2019s three weeks into the quarter. But certainly it looks like it would have looked in June, so you see some pretty good momentum tracking.","So, yeah, I\u2019ll go back to earlier comment I made, there\u2019s no big leaps of faith in the building blocks of how we look at the second half of the year. It\u2019s a reasonable outlook internally around where we see repair and remodel, where we see new construction and then just laying over where we\u2019ve got share positions and then new programs coming in and the mix that we\u2019re seeing, you kind of build all that together and we\u2019re on track for where we think the second half will be.","Dennis McGill","Okay. Thank you. And then second question as it relates to acquisitions and leverage, I think, you\u2019ve talked about being comfortable in that to 2% to 2.5% range. Given the pipeline that you\u2019ve talked about earlier, if there were multiple deals that came along that fit your criteria or even one big one, would you be willing to stretch that to above the high end or some range above the high end in the short term?","Dennis McGill","Yeah. We would. I think given that we still think, we\u2019re in the \u2013 you can call it earlier, you can call it middle early stages of recovery and we\u2019ll have a review on that, but there\u2019s a plenty ahead of us and I think, given the efficiencies we\u2019re seeing in our business and the cash flow that we throw off, I think we\u2019d be comfortable taking more incremental leverage on certainly over the next 12 months, 18 months and then having a period to pay down, so that you\u2019re in a healthy position going forward. So I think \u2013 again for the right opportunity that makes a lot sense for us, I think we\u2019d stretch to do that.","Dennis McGill","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And the last question comes from the line of Omarr Aleem from Cleveland. Your line is open.","Omarr Aleem","Thank you. Two questions. First from a cabinet category growth perspective, dealers have been in pretty good shape, the home centers have shown slower growth through this recovery, one of the categories I have spend maybe a little bit underperforming the other building product categories out there. How do you guys think about the recovery in cabinets in this cycle versus previous ones? Do you think any differently about the pace of it and where consumers are looking to spend their discretionary dollars this time around versus prior?","Christopher Klein","Yeah. I think what\u2019s different is the higher end of the market lean back faster and has really remained pretty healthy and that perhaps is supporting the dealer side of the market and that part of the market doesn\u2019t rely to the large extent on credit who are big remodel projects. Part of the markets that has been slower to recover and is impacting both dealers and home centers is really the younger households who maybe are moving into an existing home and want to do their remodel project, but credit is only now starting to become available in terms of home equity lines or extending credit beyond the purchase price.","So that traditionally you would have seen more kind of right after existing housing sale, there would be more remodel activity for that younger segment and that\u2019s the part that has been slower to recover. If you look at it from a glasses half full standpoint, that\u2019s still ahead of us. There is still demand to do those remodel projects for those homes [indiscernible] they don\u2019t particularly like the kitchen, but they\u2019re just going to cut it for a little while until home values rise, they can have better access to credit, wages increase. So that\u2019s the part I think that\u2019s lagged and as those pieces come together and I think you\u2019d see, the whole remodel side of cabinet market could exceed beyond 5%, 6%, which we\u2019ve seen in prior cycles. Toward the end of the cycle, there\u2019s a greater demand on that side.","Omarr Aleem","Thank you. And secondly, you had mentioned a little bit, some weather as a piece of a quarter, I think right at the beginning of the quarter, do you see any impact within your business from weather, that may be pushed out demand a little bit into the second half at all in any of the piece of your business?","Christopher Klein","To the extent, construction activity, people who were trying to build houses, couldn\u2019t be active, there were a number of days or weeks during the quarter, it probably slowed down some of that activity that will pick up second half. Our products are exterior product, so to extent was a remodel project or our products were growing into the new construction project, they\u2019re typically not going to be impacted by weather as a constraint. So any comment I made earlier just about the pace of construction activity, to extent there was weather in certain part of the country, it would have slowed that down.","Omarr Aleem","So, April being a little bit slower, and the quarter ending a little bit stronger, you wouldn\u2019t say weather was a piece of that?","Christopher Klein","It could have been, I think depending on part of the country, so May was pretty heavy for some parts of the country, and even into early June but I don\u2019t know, it felt more like just kind of as we exited and came into April, the momentum build through the quarter kind of April to May to June.","Omarr Aleem","Thank you, guys.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams grew total company sales and increased profits across all segments in the second quarter. The home products market continued to grow, with strong demand in new construction and continued growth in R&R. Importantly, our businesses remain focused on driving profitable growth, which has resulted in second quarter and year-to-date margin expansion across all of our businesses. We remain on track for another terrific year. Based on our solid first half performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising the bottom end of our full year EPS outlook by $0.04. First, I'd like to spend some time in our view of the U.S. home products market. Next, I will provide my perspectives on our business performance in the second quarter. Pat will then provide more details on our second quarter performance and our 2017 outlook.","Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the second quarter, the market for our home products continued to grow about at the pace that we expected. New construction grew high-single digits with strength in single-family, while R&R grew at roughly 5% with solid growth in the core and some softness at the higher end. As expected, new construction continues to grow at a high-single digit rate, with single-family growing faster than multi-family. Single-family entry-level activity continues to be robust as builders are working against strong order books and permits coming out of the winter and spring selling seasons.","This demand helped us in the second quarter and given the lag in our categories should set up a good second half as well. Repair and remodel demand also posted solid growth, especially for products at the entry level and mid-price points. Big remodel project activity was a little slower in the quarter versus strong activity in the second quarter of last year, as installation trade labors tightened money markets. The backlog in this project work could push some volume into the second half. Looking forward, our overall assumption remains that the U.S. home products market, which impacts over 70% of our sales, grows at a 6% to 7% rate for the full year. Our basket of near-term indicators for home products continues to point towards strong demand. And builders and contractors are continuing to acquire labor.","Now let me provide some perspective on our business performance. In the second quarter, our teams delivered solid sales overall and exceptional profit performance across our operating segments. Sales increased 5% in total and 6% from our home products businesses. Excluding FX, sales were up 6% in total and 7% in home products. Total company operating margin increased 100 basis points to 15.8%.","Starting with our Plumbing segment, sales were up 15% for the quarter with growth in all channels. Organic sales growth was above market in the high single-digits. Across all of our channels, we saw strong sell through and our new and refreshed product lines continued to attract consumers who trust our brands. Our Global Plumbing Group delivered as planned in the second quarter, achieving organic growth above the market rate and our recently acquired brands ROHL, Riobel, Perrin & Rowe and Shaws accelerating our growth. We're winning new business with this product portfolio of brands and price points and are in the early stages of realizing all the growth potential that we have identified. As we couple this brand line up with our new high impact marketing team, we see some exciting opportunities in the balance of 2017 and in the years to come. Our operating margin improved in the quarter on strong mix and is tracking to our target of 21% for the year.","Overall, the North American Plumbing business picked up momentum throughout the quarter and channel inventory levels are stable to down slightly, which should help us as we enter the second half of the year. Our growth in the balance of the year should continue to benefit from strong new construction demand as well as new products and placements. Some of these include the roll-out of new Propel showerheads and additional magnetic styles, new Hamden bath suite in retail and black matte-finish product line extensions in wholesale and the U by Moen, our Wi-Fi connected smart shower system.","China sales increased double-digits in local currency, driven by share gains and strong demand in direct-to-builder, as homes under construction are pushed to completion. The R&R business in China also continues to emerge, as properties built over the last 15 years to 20 years enter remodel cycles. We continue to monitor the China housing market closely as the government modifies its policies. We have flexibility as demand fluctuates and have successfully navigated through a number of cycles in this market over the past decade.","Turning to our Cabinets segment, we continue to follow a disciplined strategy focused on profitable growth. Sales grew against a tough prior-year comp and we continued to deliver on margin growth. In the second quarter, our Cabinets sales were up 1% over the prior year or 2% excluding FX as we faced a difficult comp of 17% in last year's second quarter. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 13.6%, despite modest commodity pressure as we achieved targeted share gains in attractive parts of the market.","Dealer sales were flat for the prior year where we were up 11%. We continued to see strong demand for our new construction in core semi-custom product lines offset by some softness in our higher end product lines sold into more complex projects. We continue to feel good about our performance in the dealer channel even as we were flat in the second quarter against a tough 11% comp. We are working with the strongest dealers and every MSA across the country and are selling more brands into these dealerships. Our focus on profitable growth is working in this higher margin channel, where our dedication to high levels of service is a sustainable competitive advantage.","Sales of our in-stock cabinets and vanities, which are sold through home centers grew high-single digits. New product introductions lifted ASPs and new programs with our retail partners are performing well. This is a clear area of strength in our Cabinets business and growth should continue to be solid going forward as we leverage our product innovation and our logistics expertise.","The remaining part of our Cabinets business which includes home centers, semi-custom, builder-direct in targeted markets in Canada was down slightly. Our builder-direct business grew strong double digits and our disciplined approach to growth in targeted markets resulted in share gains and continued margin improvement. Sales growth in this area was offset by Canada, which declined double digits. Canada has now had five quarters of negative growth due to soft new construction market in the central provinces, our exit of some low margin retail product lines and the impact of currency. At the beginning of the year, we began refocusing this business and accelerated the exit from some product lines. This will result in a cleaner, more focused business going forward and we project mid-single digit growth in the second half of 2017 with a stabilizing market backdrop.","In summary, our core Cabinets business excluding Canada and premium was up 4%. Given our strong execution and the easier comps in the second half of the year, we expect full year Cabinets sales to be in the mid-single digit range with a significant pick up in the second half. Importantly, we continued to grow our operating margins as planned. We remain on track for the year end guidance. And our focus on profitable growth has us growing share in the most attractive parts of the market and continuing to de-emphasize other areas with less attractive margins.","Doors reported sales were up 4.5% for the quarter. Door products again saw sales growth with gains in wholesale and at retail, which both benefited from new product introductions. Therma-Tru wholesale saw strong growth in new construction markets and excitement around our new initiatives such as new Shaker, hybrid and composite edge door styles focused on the heart of the market. And improved finish selections in glass mix as the trend toward clear and privacy glass expands.","Additionally, big builder customers remain optimistic regarding the second half and we finished the quarter with good momentum and balanced channel inventory. In retail, we continued to benefit from our enhanced merchandising and new product launches including new Shaker, (10:52) and two-panel designs. We continue to expect mid to high-single digit full-year growth for the Door business with strong operating margin improvement.","In the Security segment, sales decreased 2% from the prior-year quarter and were primarily impacted by timing as the first quarter saw an unusually high 7% growth rate and some shipments and programs were pushed from the second quarter into the second half. We expect to grow full-year sales around 4%. New product introductions and marketing initiatives will help drive second half growth as we load new stainless steel products into retail and pursue new initiatives in safety products. Importantly, margin continues to expand in this business. We are well on track to achieve our margin target for the year of 15% or better. The integration of SentrySafe into Master Lock continues to enhance our margin and our continuous improvement activities offset a modest increase in the price of steel.","So to recap the quarter, the markets for our products remained strong with a new construction market that continues to build momentum and an R&R market that is characterized by healthy demand, but a bit of a backup on more complex projects due to some trade labor constraints. Our businesses continue to execute against our disciplined growth strategies. Across the company, we're on track to deliver against our sales growth and margin targets.","Before I wrap up, let me comment on our efforts to drive long-term growth. We continue to believe that we can create meaningful incremental shareholder value by using our strong cash flow and balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase our shares and increase our dividend. Right now, we're very busy working on a number of acquisition opportunities across all segments of our business. While we cannot guarantee success in any one situation, our pipeline is robust and I would expect that we can close on some of these tuck-in acquisitions over the next 12 months given the overall level of activity.","As a reminder, over the next three years, we're continuing to believe that we have the potential to deploy more than $2 billion to drive incremental growth in shareholder value. While acquisitions are our priority, we will also selectively buy-back shares and are committed to a consistent dividend policy. Being efficient with our capital in shareholder-friendly ways has been a hallmark of our nearly six years as a public company.","So to sum up, the demand for our home products remained strong, particularly in new construction. We're continuing to take share and grow faster than the market in the parts of the market that we target. Importantly, our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide flexibility to both focus on profitable organic growth and drive incremental shareholder value with our balance sheet and strong free cash flow.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Pat who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our outlook for the second half of 2017.","Patrick Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect the ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains from continuing operations.","Starting with our second quarter results, sales were $1.4 billion, up 5% from a year ago, 6% excluding foreign currency. Organic growth was 3%, 4% excluding foreign currency. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $216 million, up 12% or $24 million compared to the same period a year ago. EPS were $0.92 for the quarter versus $0.82 the same quarter last year, increasing 12% or $0.10 driven by sales growth and margin improvement.","Now, let me provide more color on segment results. Plumbing sales during the second quarter were $435 million, up $57 million or 15% with growth in all channel. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, sales increased 16% with Canadian sales increasing 3% and China sales increasing 21%. Operating income increased $16 million to $103 million, up 18%. Operating margin for this segment was 23.8%, an increase of 60 basis points. For the full year, operating margin is expected to be 21% with full-year sales expected to increase low-double digits.","Turning to Cabinets, sales were $653 million, up $8 million or 1% versus the prior-year quarter. Dealer sales were $326 million and were flat against the strong 11% comp Chris mentioned. Excluding premium, dealer sales grew low-single digits. Sales of in-stock cabinets and vanities were $140 million, up 9%. Remaining sales to our home center semi-custom, builder-direct and Canada decreased 1%. Builder-direct was up mid-teens offset by Canada, which was down mid-teens. We expect full-year Cabinets sales to increase mid-single digits in 2017.","Additionally, our second half comps are much easier. Second half comps are roughly flat versus the first half comp of 24%. Operating income for the Cabinets segment increased $5 million over the prior-year quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was strong, increasing 70 basis points to 13.6%. Operating leverage was strong at 63% as CI offset (16:44) inflation and we made strategic margin gains in a number of our channels including builder and Canada. For the full year, we continue to expect Cabinet operating margin to increase 100 basis points versus the 10.8% delivered in 2016.","Doors sales were $134 million, up $6 million or 4.5% from the prior-year quarter. Operating income increased 15% with an operating margin of 16.9%, 160 basis points higher than the prior-year quarter. We now believe full-year operating margin for this segment could be in excess of 14%. And our full-year sales outlook in Doors remains unchanged at 6% to 8%.","Security sales were $144 million in the second quarter, down 2% to the prior year. Sales timing caused a 4 percentage point swing in this quarter with two points moved into the first quarter where we grew over 7% and two points shifting into the third and fourth quarters. Excluding timing, FX and a non-repeating promo from last year, second quarter sales were up 4%. As a reminder, our Security business should grow at roughly GDP plus an additional point for price, an additional point from innovation, or roughly at 4%. This continues to be what we expect for the full year for Security sales to grow around 4% in 2017. Segment operating income grew 10% to $22 million and operating margin grew 160 basis points to 15%. Full year operating margin has the potential to be a little higher than we initially expected and could be in excess of 15% in 2017.","To sum up consolidated second quarter performance: sales increased 5%, 6% excluding foreign currency; EPS were ahead of plan at $0.92; our total company operating margin was 15.8%, up 100 basis points from the prior year with an incremental margin, excluding acquisitions of 50%. We are squarely on track to achieve our 2017 and long-term goal for operating margin.","Turning to the balance sheet, our June 30 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $253 million, debt of $1.4 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.4 times. By yearend, we expect leverage to be around 1.1 times excluding any additional capital transactions. We currently have $750 million available under our $1.25 billion revolver. As of July 28, we have repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares this year for about $71 million. We have approximately $450 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which together with our balance sheet continues to provide ample capacity for acquisitions, additional share repurchases and dividend.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2017, our market and sales assumptions for 2017 are unchanged. We continue to assume 6% to 7% U.S. home products market growth and total global market growth of 5% to 6%. Accordingly, we continue to expect our full year 2017 sales to increase 6% to 8%. We have raised the bottom end of our full year EPS outlook by $0.04 based on our continued strong operating margin performance. Our outlook for 2017 EPS is now in the range of $3.04 to $3.12 with the midpoint reflecting a 12% increase over the prior year.","I want to pause briefly to make an important point regarding 2016 EPS comps and the implications for the third and fourth quarters of 2017. Using the midpoint of our 2017 outlook, we expect to earn approximately $1.63 in the second half of 2017, or about $0.12 improvement over the second half of 2016. We assume no tax benefit related to equity compensation in the third or fourth quarters of 2017. The third quarter presents a unique comp dynamic. In the third quarter of 2016, we had one-time benefits worth roughly $0.10; $0.07 of tax benefit from equity comp and $0.03 of expense timing due primarily to healthcare. These two one-time items will not repeat in the third quarter of 2017. However, we do expect our fourth quarter EPS performance in 2017 to be substantially better than that of 2016.","Free cash flow is expected to be around $450 million in 2017 with a conversion rate of over 90%. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest expense of around $50 million; a full year tax rate of approximately 31%; and average fully diluted shares of approximately 157 million.","In summary, we are set up for a strong 2017. Second quarter market growth was largely as expected and we delivered sales and strong profit growth. Our focus remains on profitable growth and to grow sales while expanding our operating margin. Due to continuing strong growth in our operating margin, we've raised the midpoint of our EPS outlook for the year and we remain focused on using our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and share repurchases.","I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian C. Lantz - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks, Pat. That concludes our prepared remarks on the second quarter of 2017. We will now begin taking questions. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Hi. Good morning or good afternoon.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hey, Scott.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Chris, I wanted to ask first on Cabinets. On the dealer side, obviously, some of the growth is going up against tough comps. So, I was just curious what are you hearing specifically from your customers that supports the optimism that you laid out for the balance of the year?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. First of all, we've got some pretty favorable comps in the second half. Last year, second half Cabinets was relatively weak. So, I think if you kind of do the math and look at kind of where we are seeing orders trending and the demand we see in the market, we're pretty comfortable with second half growing to the point where overall Cabinets are going to be in mid-single digits. So, I think there is stability all the way across. The only thing that we are seeing backing up and we saw some of this in the second quarter was as we talked to our customers, designers are very busy and there's kind of a queue waiting to get time with the designer and then installers, carpenters, trade labor are pretty booked up right now too. So, some of that is pushing some of the activity into the second half. There's good underlying demand. It's just getting more sequenced. So, that's the only hesitation we saw in the second quarter coming through.","I talked a little bit about premium. We've been talking about premium through second half of last year, it's improving. So, especially fourth quarter last year, premium was very soft. Came into the first quarter, it got a little bit better and right now, it's trending kind of \u2013 it was off a little bit, just down low-single digits. So, that's kind of correcting back and as we look into the second half versus comps, we should be pretty good. So, as I look into the second half, it feels like we've got some pretty good momentum rolling through the business. Locally, market-by-market, the strength of our position, the cross-sell that we've got off the Norcraft brands into the core MBCI dealers, all that's going really well. And there is a strong underlying growth on new construction, which just feeds into dealers so that local dealers are doing those small and midsized builders and that continues to run at a pace. So overall, we feel pretty good about the second half.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","That's really helpful. And then just on Plumbing, there seems to be, externally looking in, obviously some choppiness depending on what quarter it looks at and you guys have been talking pretty consistently that the margin structure there is well intact. Can you just talk about trading sales versus margin in that business to arrive at, what's the optimal way that you guys are thinking about that because this quarter clearly lined up in reverse from kind of a softer 1Q and you guys remain very confident there. So, just curious how you're thinking of the trade-off between share growth and expanding margins there, Chris?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. It will run on the business for the year. We really run the business for multi-years, and so a lot of it comes down to the pacing of spending that we're making around growth. The strategy there is to execute to grow above market and hold the margin at about 21%, and so we're spending into growth. We're leveraging the portfolio of brands, the new acquired brands into the channels. We're targeting project business, we're rolling in new product, we're investing in marketing capabilities, and that's paying off.","So, you're seeing that in the growth. If you look at \u2013 we formed the Global Plumbing Group last summer. If you look at where we're sitting now a year later, you're seeing some pretty good growth numbers and we're targeting that 21%. So, I think, yeah, it is going to have a little bit of the effect of some choppiness quarter-to-quarter around pacing, but it's always in plan. And so when we were talking about the first quarter, I said relax, we'll come near around 21%. Now in second quarter, the only caution is don't get out ahead because we are still targeting 21%, but obviously pretty good quarter, second quarter.","And you just see us in the balance of the year spending against the growth, we got great momentum in that business and in some really attractive parts of the business. So we are feeling good about what our new marketing activities are doing, our new marketing team, and so yeah, I'd say target on the 21% for the year, if you look at the first half, you're going to come in around 21% for first half, second half will look a little bit like that.","Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates","Okay. Really helpful as always, thanks so much.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Congrats on a very strong quarter and increase to the low end of the guidance range.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","As I'm looking at the quarterly results, it looks like this is about material margin expansion across the portfolio. And I noticed that GPG is growing ahead of the 12% target rate and it looks like you're on track to do $450 million in free cash flow. So kind of given the current trajectory you outlined in your prepared remarks, what's the thinking behind the free cash flow you have and use of balance sheet at this cycle? What's the M&A pipeline look like? You did a great job of outlining what the runway is in the second half of the year, and I'm just trying to think on a multi-year basis, what are you trying to get to kind of by the end of 2018 or 2019, how does M&A play into that?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. We've got a number of things underway on the M&A side, and I can never predict the timing because there is obviously, it takes two to tango, so there is somebody on the other side of everything we're doing. And I'd say it's a fairly deliberate effort across all four parts of our business in addition to looking at whether there is a fifth category that we might go into. But as we've done everything since we've been a public company six years ago, fairly deliberate, straight-forward, disciplined in our approach. But I'd say, we're looking at we've got over $2 billion to deploy. And if I looked out over the next three-plus years, I'd say that's going to go into a combination of acquisitions and some share repurchase as well as supporting the dividend.","I'd say there is a balance or a bias toward acquisition because if it's the right one, it's going to be accretive, it's going to add into kind of the businesses that we've got. And it might create a fifth leg of the company overall.","So that's where the bias is. But we'll never force anything, we're comfortable buying back shares, if that's the derivative effect of it as well. I'd say if you look at what we did over the previous five years, and project that over the next three to four years, you're going to get a pretty good mix of the bias toward acquisitions.","Acquisition market is pretty good. I mean, we're seeing a lot of things. I think expectations are high on the other side. So we feel comfortable we're going to come together around a number of things over the next 12 months and it's just comforted by the fact that there is a lot of activity that we're working on. Our folks are very busy both here in the Corporate group, as well as within each of the businesses.","And so it's a good environment to be in. I think it's \u2013 because you've got healthy underlying characteristic on the market, you've got healthy growth. It's easier for both sides to kind of stare at the market and say, we agree on where the market is going over the next three-plus years, with the positive buys and then it's about coming together around how it's going to work. So I feel good about it.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good. It sounds like you're encouraged and maybe, closer to completing some M&A. The other question, Chris, I wanted to ask is, you're getting great margin expansion and Patrick outlined some pretty clean targets for the end of 2017 where you want the businesses to be in terms of profitability.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Do you see into 2018 and 2019 if the current volume environment persists getting additional margin expansion through most of the portfolio?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. I think if you look at total company, you're going to see us \u2013 our target over the next three years would be mid-teens. So 2015, 2016 across. You look at Plumbing and we're going to grow above market there and target 21%. If there is a little bit of upside I'm not going to be troubled by that, we're growing above the market.","Within Cabinets, we're targeting mid-teens, 15%. We're on a good path there. We're growing in the attractive parts of the market. We're taking share in the attractive parts of the market, other parts of the market which might be more heavily promoted or what have you. We're not troubled by the growth in that part of the market. So we think we're going to be growing at the market about 15% share.","Doors will be mid-teens, maybe a little bit bias up there. We continue to get a great mix coming through that business. In Security's we're not going to be mid-teens and I think really as we expand that through acquisition and through some internal product development, that mix will determine whether it runs a little bit higher than that.","So again, we're pretty disciplined around looking at profitable growth not just grabbing share or grabbing growth wherever it is. And so if we're sitting here three years with some strong underlying market growth, we're going to see a really attractive margin structure around the total business.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","The plan seems to be working. Good luck in the balance of the year. Thank you.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hi.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Growth in your Plumbing business was really strong, really nice pick-up on the organic side. Can you talk about where you're seeing the share gains? Is it some of the acquisitions you've made? Is it driven by some of the investments you've made? Just give a little more color and how should we think about that trajectory in the next few quarters?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. It's always the case that when we deliver strong quarter top-line, it's usually a number of things that has been going on behind the scenes for a couple of quarters before. So it's a byproduct of investments that we've been making and accelerating product development. So we've got a lot of new products coming into the market that's innovative new products. It's also new finishes, it's some new showering. So there is strong pick-up on the new products side and some placements in the market. It's investments in the marketing that we've got, we've really upgraded the team there, brought in some great new talent and we're getting more sophisticated just in a way we're marketing a lot more digital marketing, data analytics, those sorts of things, that's why you're seeing those pay off in the market overall. So it's good execution on product, on marketing efforts, and targeting both on the retail, wholesale side.","And then if you look at the acquisitions, we've got the new portfolio of brands and those groups are working really well together. So you've got kind of that crossover of taking these acquired brands and acquired products and bringing them into distribution opportunities that we've got coming out of the historic Moen franchise, and then vice-versa taking some product innovation that you could move into a product line in a Riobel or ROHL and expand where their opportunities are and we've also come together around some joint projects. So, some bigger hospitality opportunities, those sorts of things. So all that's coming together and I think you're starting to see why we put this together a year ago and I'd say there is pretty good upside over the next few years. This is a growth team, highly energized team. They're having success. They're kind of feeding on each other and we've got good margin discipline in the business with money to invest.","So, it's coming together and as I answered the earlier question, I can't predict the exact pace of that spend so the margin bounce around. But look at 21% for the year, look at above market growth, project that out over the next couple of years and that's what our plans look like. And then by the way we're also looking at some acquisitions to further expand what that portfolio can look like in terms of product set and brands. So, I really like where that team is going right now.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","That sounds great. And then, I guess, switching gears to your Cabinets business, with the high end of that market still little soft and faster growth coming from first time-home buyers, are you kind of re-shifting your new product portfolio to better capture that market where growth could be a little faster in the next few years? And just one last thing, curious on your view on the competitive activity in the market \u2013 you previously called out pick up in promotional activity just broadly in Cabs? Thanks.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. In Cabs, this is not dramatic. It shows up in terms of kind of the styles and the finishes that really go into new construction and I'd say it's not just entry level, but it is more significant across kind of on this construction. A lot of opaques which is painted, a lot of whites and grays, and so as we look at how we're managing capacity, we're managing capacity and we work towards those products. We've got \u2013 remember, we've got a quarter of the Cabinet business. So, we're participating in virtually every price point, every product category. And so as we look at it, it's about shifting where that capacity is, where we're making capacity investments and finishing, where we're emphasizing products that we've got and expanding it into brands and into dealers where there is that demand. So, it's kind of drawing it in, we're not necessarily having to push it. It's going to where that draw is \u2013 is where we're responding to it around capacity.","In terms of promotion, it continues to be more of a kind of a retail phenomena than it is dealer phenomena and among the big guys we continue to be the least aggressive of those. We've held share there so our approach is working.","I'd say, it's kind of more of the same, little bit elevated second quarter, but we held on to the share we've got and didn't chase after it. Clearly, as you saw in the margin expansion, we're not chasing after a lot of promo sale. Yeah, I mean, it is where it is as the capacity in the market gets absorbed, the bias for more promotion goes down because others will start to behave as we have which is needed to fillip your plans and we felt for a while that we remain disciplined and focus on those personal market that we see attractive margins that we'll be doing just fine and I think that's what is playing out.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Sounds good. Thanks a lot for the color. Thank you.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hello, good afternoon.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hi.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I wanted to go back to some of the share gains in Cabinets that you've seen. Can you just give us a bit more color on perhaps who you think you're taking that share from and how sustainable is that especially as we think about maybe some of the shift that's coming in terms of price points?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","So, it's really \u2013 our Cabinet business right now is about a quarter of the market and you can really look at a number of different segments within that business. So within in-stock, cabinets and vanities, we're a really big participant in that part of the market now. There is a couple of private companies out there that are also participants in that part of the market and there're some import product, but we've consistently taken share in that market going back to the acquisition of WoodCrafters and then building off of that platform and expending our own internal capabilities.","So, where you've seen us gain share in that vanities and in stock, we've got great product; we've got great service, we've got great logistics support into retail, which is managing all that inventory at the store level with them in a great partnership and across all the big retailers. And so that's really sustainable and those are kind of just doing a lot of the fundamentals and intrinsics, and a lot of complicated business process really, really well.","When you look at new construction, we targeted going back two years, three years now, probably more like three years, more the East than the West and in the East, just focused on those places where we thought we would be quite competitive and we've been growing faster than the market with those targeted builders and in those targeted markets. So, I'd say, you kind of look at that as geographically where we're targeting. We're having success because it works for us in that part of the market.","Within dealer, it's just about that breadth of our dealer coverage and the number of dealers that we've got across North America and cross-selling more and more brands into them across price points and so that's quite sustainable because we haven't penetrated that whole dealer base yet to the maximum extent that we can.","And then within Canada, Canada has kind of been a soft market for us. We took some steps earlier this year, second quarter included to restructure part of the market, so that market will start growing again. It was up mid-teens, but there isn't \u2013 the competitive intensity isn't the issue, it's more about the market has been soft especially in the single-family side of the market, and we were a bit too diffused in all the products that we were supporting up there. So, we try to tighten that up a bit.","So, I'd say, overall, we obviously compete against a couple of the other public cabinet manufacturer but you look at across the board it's those plus still some private companies be it either in the in-stock or the cabinets or vanities side where there is a especially one big private company and then on the dealer side you still have a fragmented market with a lot of local guys who are still supporting their local market dealers.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great, that's very helpful. And then I know, in your comments you motioned some higher steel prices that you faced in your Security segment. Can you just perhaps talk broadly across the business. How you are thinking about commodity prices and inflation as we think about the second half?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. And it starts with \u2013 we budgeted for the year, that you'd see some commodity expansion. We had been two years, three years, with very favorable commodity environment. So, we assumed coming into the year that we would \u2013 all of our big commodities would see some inflation. I'd say it's tracking in aggregate at or a little bit better, more beneficial to us. But then if you break it into each segment you're seeing some pressure in certain parts of the market.","What we're able to do is leverage our scale in terms of trying to offset some of that, and the way we buy some of those commodities. And then in some places we have to take price to offset some of that pressure. And so, it's a fairly deliberate effort kind of across each of the four businesses has all of a different pressure point. But so far, we've been pretty successful in countering that in our operations, and then where we had to take some limited price to offset it.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Very helpful, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question is, it seems like margins across your segments were either above your full-year targets or I think in the case of Security was in line with your full-year target but it seems like you're largely keeping the full-year targets the same. So I mean I'm just curious are there some timing-related expenses that got pushed that kind of boosted margins in the quarter and \u2013 or are you expecting somewhat of a slowdown in the second half, I'm just trying to understand, trying to reconcile that.","Patrick Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","So, John, this is Pat. You're right a number of things were above, most notably Plumbing, right, and as Chris mentioned, our long-term target in plumbing is 21%. It can be choppy from quarter-to-quarter. That's more about investment, and investment choices we make throughout the years. So if you look at the first half, for example, in Plumbing, it's about 21.5% for the first half and it's going to be 21% for the year. So that's an area where you're not seeing any slowdown on the year.","And the other large business, we have Cabinets, the margin was 13.6%, up 70 basis point. What we see in Cabinet is seasonality, as you do in Doors. These are leveraged fixed cost manufacturing facility. So Q1, the early part of Q1 coming out of the holidays and the latter part of Q4 going into the holidays, you see those margins go down that's not because there is an issue with the business, that's just because of the seasonality of the use of fixed cost base.","And then Security; Security is performing really nicely, up 160 basis points, yes, it was at 15% which is, as you point out, it's full-year guidance, nothing happening that will dilute that in the back half of the year in Security, it's just that by the latter third of the year in Security, they will start lapping their SentrySafe integration. So I think you look at Cabinets and Doors with normal seasonality. Plumbing is on track for the year and it'll slow down and in Security they'll lap the seasonality of the SentrySafe integration.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for that, Pat. And then I think you guys mentioned $0.03 of healthcare costs in the third quarter of last year or is that healthcare cost that were deferred from the second quarter of 2017 into the third quarter of 2017?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","It was a catch-up, a true-up of the performance of our healthcare plans in 2016. What we did in 2016 and we've continued in 2017 was, we introduced the option for our associates to elect some high deductible plans and that's typically younger folks who are quite healthy, but are compelled by health insurance, opted for high deductible plans. We're pretty conservative in our estimation of how that would play out and by the third quarter last year, we actually had to true it up and take some more income in because the expense was performing better than what we thought it would.","Since then, we've got a better beat on how those perform within our overall healthcare plans and so now, it's just running at what is the projected level, so that was a one-time catch-up and now we kind of know how those plans perform.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Which segment was that in?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","That was across the board. So it was all U.S. employees, so we introduced higher deductible healthcare plans, all four of our businesses have got pretty healthy U.S. employee base, we're 70% U.S. employees and so that was kind of across the board. Some of those people historically might not have taken healthcare. But, so often we've got them on the healthcare rolls and we got a high deductible plan. And we don't know, okay, they got high deductible, but once the deductible goes away, they're going to be spending at some higher level above that. It turned out now it's actually more predictable than we thought.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Tim.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, just maybe back on the cadence in the back half of the year. Just to maybe be more clear. Should we be thinking maybe something up single-digits in the third quarter from an EPS growth perspective and then maybe back to double-digits in the fourth quarter? Is that kind of the set up you guys envision?","Patrick Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, Tim, this is Pat. We should be expecting a strong second half in general. Sales will be up towards the higher end of our guidance. The leverage will be over 25%. There will be that dichotomy in third quarter versus fourth quarter EPS, but the midpoint of our guidance, we have $0.12 in the back half and you'll see that predominantly be in the fourth quarter. So yeah, low EPS growth in the third quarter around a few cents and then the predominance of it in the fourth quarter, driven predominantly by a tax difference.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right. Right.","Patrick Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Not by an operating income growth difference.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. Great. And then Chris, maybe just on capital deployment, it sounds like you feel pretty good about the pipeline, maybe closing some things over the next 12 months? If there would be some acquisition activity that would maybe move into 2018, will you guys internally maybe be a little bit more active to buy back stock as a replacement?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","We could. We're in the market and as you saw, we bought some back this year, and continuing to be both opportunistic, as well as just kind of managing through, we don't want to delever to an extraordinary extent.","As we said, really starting six years ago, we're going to be efficient with the cash flow. We've got a great set of operators in our business and when we need to address market turns, we can address them by managing our cost base, we don't need to stockpile cash. So we're not inclined to stockpile cash. The release valve will be a little bit more buyback. So we're trying to manage that. I think we've got a lot of flexibility just because we've got debt capacity, we've got open revolver, and we just in general obviously, earnings EBITDA continues to grow, cash flow continues to grow. So you've got a lot of borrowing fire power to handle things even if a couple of the things we're working on at once, we think we can still kind of flex-up on leverage to take those on. So that's the dynamic, is if it ends up (50:16), yeah, you'd probably see us buying a little bit more.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Good luck on the second half.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to drill down a little bit in terms of the components of the guidance range. I noticed in the prepared remarks that part of the assumption set now calls for a tax rate of 31%, I think previously you were at 31.5% and I think that's roughly about $0.03 a share.","So when you take the raising of the midpoint of only $0.02, but at the same time you kind of talked about the raise being driven by continued strong operating margin performance and I think you even pointed to some upside in Security more than you expected, I was just trying to reconcile that because it seems again that if that tax rate change might account for slightly more of the raise by mid-points?","Patrick Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. We raised after the first quarter and captured $0.01 to $0.02 of the tax benefit, because we came out of the first quarter with $0.06 of tax benefit versus $0.03 prior year. So you're correct, it's just that we did a chunk of that when we raised guidance in the first quarter and the raise that we're taking this quarter is based more on the operating margin.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I guess, maybe we could talk about that offline, I'm still a little confused there, but maybe just shifting to the second question. You kind of talked before about M&A and obviously that's a big part of the strategy, in particular the Plumbing segment. At the same time, you just mentioned that you have the ability to continue to buy back stock and perhaps do both, share buyback and M&A and flex-up in the near-term if you need to. So with that being said, I was kind of surprised that we didn't see a little bit more of share repurchase.","This quarter you've done some year-to-date, but still perhaps, at least from a run rate perspective, this year a bit less than prior few years. So just kind of wondering about the rationale there and if this doesn't, perhaps speculating, but perhaps part of the reason is that, I'm just wondering if the M&A pipeline is something that you feel perhaps is heating up, so to speak, and you just want to have that much more flexibility over the next quarter or two?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's a combination of those factors. I think we do feel good about kind of looking over the next 12 months that we think we'll be able to deploy capital into M&A. So, we're not going to be overly aggressive on share repurchase, but we'll be in the market and we'll be buying back shares at a reasonable pace. I think what we've shown is that we can do both. And so, at some point, if it extends out and it looks like, okay, we're going to get more done in the acquisition side in 2018, you'll probably see us be a little bit more aggressive in repurchase. If it looks like, yeah, things were moving forward, coming at us, especially couple things at once, then you might see us be a little less active.","So, we're on it. We're focused on being efficient with our cash and our balance sheet. We're trying to be as both prudent and appropriately aggressive. We're big holders of our shares and are focused on shareholder value and so that's where we start every discussion with is how do we create more shareholder value. So, we're not trying to be conservative in stockpiling cash or paying down debt. We're looking for opportunities to deploy capital. So, I guess you can read into that what you make of it, so sorry, I can't go any farther than that.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just to clarify, I appreciate, going back to the first question a second where Pat, you said that really the raising of guidance this quarter is by stronger operating margin performance. Again, can we just make sure which segments are we really talking about here, again you kind of alluded to Security being a little bit better and driving that I guess $0.02 up at the midpoint?","Patrick Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","I would say it's across our businesses, everybody is on or above their operating margin target. And so, certainly in Doors and Security it's probably where the highest potential beating both the targets we set for this year and getting to their longer term averages faster. But we expect everybody at this point to be delivering on or above their operating margin targets.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks.","Patrick Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes all the time that we have allotted for the Q&A session today.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed some time to address questions that you may have.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.","In the third quarter, our teams continued to execute against our growth strategies and manage the effects of tariffs. We delivered solid results as sales grew 6% and operating margin improved.","I'm particularly proud of our team's performance year-to-date. In 2019, we have experienced a housing market that was slower in recovering than we initially planned as well as a variety of other external pressures, most significantly higher levels of tariffs. And we've been overcoming these challenges and delivering solid performance with year-to-date sales also growing 6% and operating margin expanding.","Growth initiatives across plumbing, value price cabinetry and decking have been top priorities, and the funding of these areas is delivering top line growth today and will fuel 2020 as well. A multi-disciplined effort across our supply chain teams, our legal teams and our pricing teams is working to offset the ever-changing tariff landscape. Taken together, the performance this year is truly impressive.","So I'll first take you through our view of the US home products market. Next, I'll turn the call over to Nick, our President and Chief Operating Officer. He will share highlights of the more aggressive actions he's taking across the business to strengthen the company for our next phase of growth, especially as he prepares to assume the CEO role in January. Then, he will share his perspective on our business performance in the third quarter. Finally, Pat will provide more detail on our third quarter results and 2019 outlook.","Starting with our updated view of the US home products market. As I mentioned, in the third quarter, the market continued to be slow, but began to pick up in September and is now improving in October. Currently, we are seeing more sustained momentum from both new construction and repair and remodel markets. The data is now pointing to the modest pickup in growth that we had expected earlier in the year with healthier order rates in September and into October that should continue.","In the third quarter, we estimate that the market for our products grew 2% with the repair and remodel market growing around 2% to 3%. New construction spending on our product categories was approximately flat to down slightly. The ramp-up in new construction activity that is starting now, coupled with a modest pickup in existing housing sales, should translate into a healthier market over the next year. These market dynamics, combined with the tailwind in cabinets from the recently announced antidumping duties against Chinese cabinet manufacturers, gives us optimism about the fourth quarter and 2020.","In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Nick Fink, our incoming CEO in January 2020. As I've said before, the Board and I have confidence in him as a great partner and leader. He has a proven track record of success with leading brands both here and in previous roles. Nick built out our Global Plumbing Group platform to be a multi-brand channel and geography powerhouse. The platform has consistently delivered above-market growth at industry-leading margins. He built strong iconic brands, including the rejuvenation of the core Moen brand and the establishment of the House of ROHL while bringing innovation into the market through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Since becoming President and COO earlier this year, he's been focused on bringing his winning approach to our other businesses, working closely across our segments and leadership teams to identify areas of opportunity. He has also led the successful navigation of a challenging tariffs period, repositioning supply chains and managing pricing strategies across all segments of the business.","I'll now turn the call over to Nick, who will provide some additional color on his efforts across the businesses and discuss our third quarter performance.","Nick Fink","Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we have many opportunities ahead of us. We are laser focused on investing in and capturing the most promising of these opportunities. Additionally, we've worked hard to successfully manage through the continually evolving tariff environment, which has required us to allocate supply chain and cross-functional resources temporarily away from our planned efficiency improvement efforts.","We continue to build upon our growth in our Global Plumbing Group, which is now more than half of our total company profit. We will continue to be successful in re-energizing the core GPG brand, Moen, behind our hero for beautiful water campaign, which is already showing remarkable results.","We're driving consumer-relevant innovation in core faucet and shower categories as well as new categories. We're leveraging channel partnerships and key customer management and we're building our growth engines in China, digital water and M&A and partnerships.","In outdoor living, we are focused on the expansion of Fiberon Decking. We're building a strong consumer brand and competitor in the market. We're investing in the business in additional expansion opportunities and we're executing against substantial wins to date.","Early in the third quarter, we announced that Fiberon will expand distribution significantly across the West and Southwest through OrePac Building Products, in addition to other significant multistate distributors such as Wolf in the Northeast, Weekes Forest Products across the Upper Midwest and Coastal Forest Products in the Southeast. Coverage and distribution through OrePac provides an opportunity for Fiberon to leverage these strong, existing relationships as both of our businesses seek additional opportunities for growth in outdoor living in 2020 and beyond.","We're also making continued progress on a more aggressive Cabinets pivot plan to transform this business. Let me take a minute to tell you about the latest big step in our Cabinets transformation, the planned retirement of Cabinets President, Dave Randich, and the orderly transition to a new incoming President, Dave Banyard, on November 18.","We are incredibly excited that Dave Banyard has decided to come on board to lead this business into a new era of growth. We are impressed with his accomplishments and his tremendous passion for transforming businesses and delivering improved performance. I've spent time getting to know Dave and his leadership style, approach to business and deep level of integrity are a great fit for our culture and our teams.","Additionally, with his wealth of global manufacturing, operations and commercial leadership experience, coupled with a proven track record of executing, we believe he will be successful in capturing growth and margin improvement in this business. Our teams are excited and preparing for his first day in a few weeks, and I know he'll hit the ground running. We wish Dave Randich all the best and thank him for his over 12 years of service with the company, including the last 7 years at MasterBrand Cabinets where he significantly grew and transformed the business.","So now let me turn to our results for the third quarter where we continued to execute against our initiatives and had solid sales and profit results. In the quarter, total company sales increased 6% and operating margin was up slightly to 13.9%. This was a solid result in light of a softer market than we expected, tariffs and other external pressures and investments we've made for future growth. Overall, our performance in the quarter was helped by the result of rigorous expense control across the businesses while we continue to make investments to support our growth opportunities. We will continue to take steps to outperform a more moderately growing market and offset tariffs and other external pressures, including transforming our supply chain, taking price, launching innovation, expanding and growing categories and channels and integrating acquisitions and partnerships.","So turning to the segments beginning with Plumbing. In the third quarter, the Global Plumbing Group continued to outperform the market with sales growth excluding FX of over 12% and operating margin of 21.8%. Growth was driven by above-market POS in the U.S. and strong double-digit growth in China, where we continued to expand our product offering and take share. Continued strong performance in our core markets more than offset continued softness in the Canadian housing market. Our re-energized Moen brand is showing increased awareness, loyalty and purchase intent as well as continued share gains. We will also continue to build momentum through product innovation and partnerships, such as U by Moen, Flo by Moen and Elkay. These innovations and partnerships are helping to expand our portfolio and are allowing us to convert customers and drive gains in distribution.","In Cabinets, sales were down 2%, flat in the U.S., and operating margin was 10%. Sales in the targeted value price part of the market, which is now approaching 50% of our business, were up mid-single digits in the quarter as we continue to have success and take share. Sales of higher price point, made-to-order cabinets contracted in the mid-single-digit range. As part of the more aggressive pivot, we are accelerating cost-out initiatives by continuing to ramp up our value price capacity and tightening capacity for semi-custom products. We are leveraging our Mexico and other low-cost country supply chain to deliver even more value price products while maintaining the service and quality our valuable dealer network expects from us.","As antidumping duties come into effect in addition to the existing 301 tariffs, we have been aggressively launching consumer-facing innovations in our Mantra, UVE, Aristokraft and Urbana lines across our 4,500 industry-leading kitchen and bath dealers. This new higher margin yet value price suite of products addresses the increasingly strong demand our customers are seeing from consumers. We will fill the void and take back share as Chinese products begin to pull back from the market, a trend that should continue through 2020.","Our retail bath and kitchen in-stock programs are also expanding in home centers along with more significant online presence. Margin performance, in light of all of our actions, is encouraging even as we continue to navigate the near-term inefficiency due to the large-scale transformation to the manufacturing footprint and the supply network.","In the quarter, Doors & Security sales increased 11% and operating margin was 14.5%. Doors POS performance was up while managing through a significant retail inventory rebalancing versus the strong comp last year and the lag to recently improving new construction activity. In decking, due to our program wins earlier in the year, we continue to accelerate investment to capitalize on growth opportunities that will begin to be realized in the fourth quarter and more significantly into 2020.","And in Security, the team continues to work towards closing the gap on the tariff impact with cost and price actions. The Master Lock brand is on track with improved product quality and service levels, and we expect to see stronger growth beginning in the fourth quarter as price increases take effect in order to help offset tariffs.","To wrap up, as I look across our businesses, I'm incredibly pleased with our results and performance. I'm impressed with the challenges we've overcome and the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives this quarter and throughout the year. Outperforming the market as we have done in the past takes even more resolve and teamwork in this environment of more moderate growth. I see our teams embrace these challenges with passion and ingenuity every single day.","Looking ahead, we have vast opportunities both within and across the businesses. The initiatives that we've taken and investments made in 2019 which are delivering results set us up to accelerate even faster as growth returns in 2020. We continue to collaborate, innovate and leverage our strengths. All of these efforts set us up to win and create even more value.","I will now turn the call over to Pat.","Pat Hallinan","Thanks, Nick. As a reminder, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains in order to best reflect ongoing business performance. Let me start with our third quarter results.","Sales were $1.46 billion, up 6% from a year ago and 3% on an organic basis, excluding Fiberon and FX. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $203 million, up 7% or $13 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was up slightly to 13.9%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of around 50 basis points of full year operating margin improvement despite market softness and tariff pressures that have been more challenging than those in our plan or in our revised second quarter guidance. EPS were $0.95 for the quarter versus $0.93 for the same quarter last year. We are pleased by our team's continued ability to grow sales and earnings during a period of softer market growth, the persistence of a challenging trade environment and while navigating significant supply chain transitions in a number of our businesses.","Now let me provide more color on our segment results, beginning with Plumbing. Sales for the third quarter were $514 million, up $53 million or 11%. Excluding currency, sales increased 12%. When also excluding the comp to last year's hurricane impact, sales were up over 8% in the quarter. Continued strong double-digit growth in China and solid U.S. POS drove the quarter with reported sales results slightly muted by Canadian housing market weakness.","Plumbing operating income increased 20% to $112 million. Operating margin was 21.8%, an excellent result driven by cost discipline and sales growth leverage in the US and China. We continue to be on track with our full year outlook in Plumbing with sales up in the mid to high single digit range and with operating margin around 21%.","Doors & Security sales were $355 million, up $35 million or 11% from the prior year quarter driven by Fiberon. Door sales were flat and impacted by a lag to the soft yet improving third quarter US new construction market and a significant inventory rebalancing, especially in retail. Security sales were down in the quarter due to international market softness and commercial channel timing. We are expecting Security sales to increase double digits in the fourth quarter due to commercial project timing and favorable comps to last year's service issues.","Operating income was flat at $52 million. Income performance was muted by a price-to-tariff lag in Security, the mix associated with the retail inventory rebalancing and a strong comp to last year and lack of volume leverage in Doors & Security. Versus the prior year, we expect Doors & Security operating income to improve considerably during the fourth quarter due to cost actions taken during the third quarter, Security tariff pricing going into effect, volume leverage as new construction demand resumes and comps to Security's 2018 service issues. For the segment, we are on track to deliver mid-teen sales growth in the full year and operating margin above 13%.","Turning to Cabinet. Sales for the third quarter were $590 million or down 2% versus the prior year quarter. Sales in the US were flat. As Nick said, sales of value price products in the U.S. were up mid-single digits while sales of mid to higher price point products were down mid-single digits.","Operating income in the third quarter was $59 million, down $6 million versus the prior year. And operating margin was 10%, consistent with our full year target. We expect Cabinet operating margin improvement in the fourth quarter driven by incremental cost actions taken during the third quarter and market-driven volume improvement. For the full year, we expect total Cabinet sales to be flat while up slightly in the U.S. full year operating margin is expected to be around 10%.","For the total company, to sum up third quarter performance, sales increased 6%. EPS grew to $0.95, demonstrating our ability to execute and drive growth and margin improvement in a slower tariff-challenged market. Our total company operating margin was up slightly to 13.9%. We should benefit from the financial discipline and expense control we executed year-to-date as the housing market gradually improves.","Before turning to the balance sheet, I want to take a moment to provide perspective on our numerous tariff recovery efforts and the impact on the business. We continue to mitigate the impact of current tariffs through a mix of supplier cost sharing, shifts in geography and other actions including pricing. Through this combination of actions, we were able to offset roughly $15 million of gross tariff exposure in the quarter and expect to offset around $55 million for the full year.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains solid with cash of $336 million, net debt of $2 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 2.2x. We continue to have the capacity and flexibility to fund potential acquisitions and share repurchases as we delever naturally during the second half and over time.","During the quarter, we priced an offering of $700 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2029 at 3.25% and maintained our solid investment-grade rating. The company refinanced its $1.25 billion revolving credit facility in September. With a longer duration across our debt structure at attractive interest rates, we have the liquidity to invest for growth both organically and inorganically.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for approximately $50 million, bringing the year-to-date share purchase total to 2 million shares for approximately $100 million. We have $314 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","Turning to the details of our outlook for 2019. Based on the market for our products growing 2% to 2.5%, we have tightened the range of expected full year sales growth to 5% to 6%. As a result, we now expect EPS within the range of $3.53 to $3.63. As we've seen the market begin to pick up in September and October, we are also encouraged by the momentum of our Plumbing business in the U.S. and China, the continued demand strength in the market segments to which we are pivoting our Cabinet business and Fiberon's distribution gain.","We expect 2019 free cash flow of approximately $480 million to $500 million, which includes the accelerated investments in capacity and inventory to support new composite decking customers. We anticipate a cash conversion rate at or above 95%. At year-end, we expect net debt-to-EBITDA to be 2.0x versus 2.4x in the prior year.","The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: interest rate expense of around $94 million, a tax rate between 25% and 26%, and average fully diluted shares of approximately 141 million.","In summary, our teams are executing well in an improving market and are making progress on our strategic initiatives, which should better reflect in our results in the fourth quarter and next year.","I will now pass the call back to Chris for some closing remarks.","Chris Klein","Thank you, Pat. Before we begin the Q&A session, I have a few final thoughts. In early 2009, I began leading the Home and Hardware division of Fortune Brands. 8 years ago, in October of 2011, we spun off as our own independent company, FBHS. Over the past 11 years, we've restructured businesses, greatly expanded through innovation and penetration of new markets and made changes in the portfolio of businesses we operate. Most significantly, we have built great teams around our unique and powerful culture.","As I look out into the balance of 2019 and 2020, I see an improving home products market. We have positioned our businesses with enhanced supply chains and cost structures and have funded growth opportunities to ensure we prosper in this improving market.","January of 2020 is an ideal time for me to transition from CEO to Executive Chairman and for Nick Fink to take the reins as our new CEO. He inherits a great team and a great set of businesses and opportunities, and I know the transition will go smoothly. I am excited for this next chapter of our company's growth.","With that, I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks on the third quarter of 2019. We will now begin to take a limited number of questions. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl","First question, I guess just big picture, you guys have had a lot of change, Chris, with your transition and now the change in Cabinets. And I guess I want to focus specifically on Cabinets and Dave coming in and transition there. And I appreciate your comments around the moving pieces, but from the outside looking in, I think a lot of people see these last couple of quarters sales growth stall out a little, margins backtrack. Clearly, there's some investment going on underneath all of this in the pivot, but now you have a new -- a change in leadership. It causes a lot of -- it drives a lot of questions. So just hoping you can elaborate a little more on the changes that you're making there, Dave's goals coming in and just what you can give us as far as incremental confidence that the Cabinets pivot will ultimately pay off in terms of margin progression and getting the growth back on track.","Chris Klein","Sure. Yes. There's a lot there in that question. I'd say the progress of the plan overall is on track. And if anything, we accelerated this year in terms of investment in capacity in our supply chains supporting the value part of the market. And there, we've put up consistent growth, single digits, high single digits, low double digits growth really throughout the last 4, 5 quarters. On the other side of the market, we've been talking about across KCMA, have been candid about weaker semi-custom premium volumes in the marketplace. So that is all going to plan. I think our restructuring capacity is on track. I'll have Nick give a little bit more detail.","In terms of Dave's transition and frankly my transition, we focus on succession pretty rigorously. And if you look across kind of the last 5 to 8 years, the transition in my leadership team has been pretty continuous as people have retired or moved along and we've brought in new talent. And so there's no real event or catalyst around Dave Randich. Dave has done an outstanding job. He indicated his desire to retire and so we began looking for his replacement. And so understand there's a lot of moving pieces. But in terms of where the Cabinet business is going, we actually think we're at a pretty interesting inflection point right now and are pretty optimistic. And maybe, Nick, you could give a little bit more detail on that.","Nick Fink","Sure. I'd be happy to, Chris. First, I'd start with just steady performance in the quarter, flat in the US in a declining market. So you're seeing share gains come through at a 10% margin, which is exactly what we were targeting for the year. But for inefficiencies that we had as we ramped some of our value capacity even faster than we expected, we would have hit a margin even higher than that. And so all of that sort of point to some really positive momentum. And then I think you layer on that some new products that we're bringing into the market that are exceeding our expectations at that value price point, both through our home center partners, I'll touch on in a second, and through dealer partners. Yes, in home center, so just yesterday, Home Depot, one of our key retail partners, recognized us by naming us as their kitchen and bath supplier partner of the year. So a credit to what they're seeing us do. And in dealer, we've launch a new product with Mantra Omni as well as Aristokraft and Urbana lines, all targeting that part of the marketplace. And I'll tell you Mantra is surpassing our expectations by quite a lot. So pivot by no means done, but a lot of the changes are really well underway.","And then against that backdrop, Dave Randich has been with the company 12 years, 7 years leading this business. He indicated in the spring a desire to retire which kicked off for us a succession plan. And we're delighted that we were able to attract a candidate as outstanding as Dave Banyard, who's going to come here and bring his passion for transforming businesses and delivering improved performance to us at a time when we really think that we're going to see incremental growth come as the Chinese manufacturers retreat. We're already seeing that pretty significantly through the import numbers. And we're targeted right at that sweet spot in the market. And we've got 25% share, our position in dealer and our position in home center very well situated to pick up that incremental volume.","Michael Dahl","My second question...","ChrisKlein","Did we get it all? Did we get it all?","Michael Dahl","There's always more. Second one, shifting gears, Plumbing, clearly, another standout quarter there and especially where I think we've seen some other indicators that would suggest the market growth was somewhat subdued in the quarter. So just I guess heard the comments about China, but just a little more detail on what exactly is driving the significant outperformance on the top line. Was there any load-in benefit? How should we think about the next couple of quarters, particularly as I think the fourth quarter guide, if you're really going down to the 21% operating margin for the full year might suggest some deceleration but maybe just clarify that.","Nick Fink","Sure. And I'll be happy to. Okay. Let's start with overall performance. The group grew over 12% adjusted for FX at a 21.8% margin, so obviously some pretty stellar performance. What I'll say is, we're continuing to build upon that group, which now represent more than half of total company profit with more to come.","So if the question is sort of, what's driving that? I'd step back and say, we're now a couple of years into re-energizing the core Moen brand and it's really firing on all cylinders. The brand is being powered by twin engines of brand building and innovation. And so our hero for beautiful water campaign which we launched last year is driving increased awareness, loyalty and purchase intent. We're seeing those metrics come through really strongly. That's translating into continued share gains and we're seeing some great results there. And then we've launched some really consumer-relevant innovation, both in the core as well as some new categories, and that's driving excitement with other consumers and our customers. That's true both across the core market in the U.S. where we're outperforming and our business in China. And through that, we're continuing to leverage all our channel partnerships and key customer management.","Layering on top of that, we're still building out more growth engines, China, digital water, luxury plumbing and through our partnerships. And so I would say, if you ask how we feel about it, despite multiple years of market-leading performance at these margins, we're confident we're still just getting rolling in Plumbing. The best is yet to come. And so we're continuing to invest behind the brand.","And as far as the question about inventory is concerned, I would say, it's actually pretty lean and it's been lean throughout the year as we've seen our wholesale partners navigate pretty conservatively. And so, if anything, we think Plumbing would be poised for acceleration as the market comes back and that pipeline has to fill again to serve that demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.","TimWojs","So I guess maybe first question just on the cabinet market, just trying to think of how you think it evolves next year with the tariffs and the dumping duties on China. Just how much of the Chinese share do you think actually can come back to the U.S. manufacturers or again, how are you kind of thinking about it from a planning perspective?","ChrisKlein","Yes. Probably in the range of 12%, 13%, I think, is where most industry analysts estimate it at and it's really drying up. So you can see it in the import data, but we're on the ground and have moved all of our suppliers out. And the shipments out of China have really stalled. So I think it opens up the market for those who are leaders in the market today. Nick can talk to you a little bit about some of the things that we're positioned against. But we're 1\/4 of the market and one of the powerhouse in dealer and a lot of this was flowing right through dealer. And so our pivot plan has preserved those dealerships. And some have suggested we could have gone faster. And I'd say, we could have gone faster and we could have blown up our dealer relationships but we didn't. We could have gone faster and we could have diminished our service levels to the home center but we didn't.","And so now as volume comes back and China dries up, we're in a terrific position to capture it. We're trying to estimate it. We've got capacity to be able to service it. And Nick will talk to you about a lot of the products that we've launched and are coming into the market. We'll quantify in January, but suffice to say, we're pretty optimistic about it. And in the core market through new construction, R&R picking up, in addition to some of the Chinese or really a good part of the Chinese manufacturer volume coming in drying up, we're going to be in a good spot. So maybe Nick, you can just talk a little bit about some of the things that we've launched and really what we're anticipating.","Nick Fink","Sure. Sure. I'd start by noting, these tariffs and duties are already in effect, right? And so the Chinese manufacturers have to go premium. And I think that's why you're seeing such a precipitous drop-off in these volumes. All that being said, we're not dependent on government action. And so independent of that, we've been building out our Mexico and low-cost country supply chain and we've been launching products into this part of the marketplace where we believe we could succeed, duties or no duties. And Mantra and the success of Mantra is a great example of that. All that said, now that duties are already included with imports dropping off, we have the supply chain in place, we have the suite of products right at the heart of this market, already in-market and accelerating, more launching. And so we think we're really well positioned. Again, we're 25% share. We got the right supply chain that we believe is competitive anyway and the right suite of products. And so as we sort of turn the corner here into 2020, we think this could be a really material tailwind for the business.","TimWojs","Okay. Okay. I appreciate all that color. And then on tariffs, just is there a way to just talk about what your exposure to List 4 looks like and maybe what kind of looking out to 2020 if you snap the line, what the total gross exposure to tariffs looks like next year?","Pat Hallinan","Yes. Our exposure to tariff this year, and this is a tariff expense, is $55 million this year. We would expect to fully offset that. Next year, as we go forward, we're always working cost actions to try and take things off the list. But of course, we'll be anniversary-ing next year more months of List 4 and more months of List 3 being at 25%. And we would expect next year, Tim, to also have about $50 million of tariff expense exposure. But I would say the increase of List 3 was about as big an impact as the addition of List 4, and Plumbing is about 60% of the total tariff picture.","TimWojs","Okay. Okay. So about a $50 million kind of incremental gross expense next year that you think you can offset?","Pat Hallinan","Well, I wouldn't call it incremental, it's just a continuation. Again, I'm giving you this year. We'll pay tariffs of about $55 million. Next year, if there's no further cost actions which, of course, there will be some more further cost actions. Where we sit right now, we would expect to pay about $50 million of tariff expense. So it would actually go down a little bit year-over-year, think of it as run rate neutral.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Phil Ng","Appreciating R&R and housing has been a little more choppier, but I guess on your last call, kind of indicated market conditions firmed up in June, July, but the top line was obviously a touch weaker. How confident are you in terms of the trends you saw in September and October provides you a good line of sight things are going to pick up in the fourth quarter and positions you well for 2020?","Chris Klein","Yes. So I'd say coming out of July, we're hopeful things would accelerate into August. They really didn't. September, there was a noticeable difference. So our performance in September, which is in the numbers we just reported in the third quarter, was much stronger than July, August. And in October, order rates are continuing at a much improved rate, and that's across the whole business. I think not surprising, we are pretty exposed on new construction, which is a good thing when new construction starts picking back up again. So you saw both public builders and we see the private, order rates that are increasing significantly. And that's starting to translate through permits and starts. And we've got pretty lean inventories across most of the channels that we're selling into. So given our share positions in plumbing, cabinets, entry doors, exposed to new construction, we're starting to see that pick up flow through. And R&R, it improved this fall relative to where we were in the spring, in the summer. Maybe you can give a little bit of kind of what we're seeing inside of the businesses, Nick.","Nick Fink","Yes. I would say through the spring, there were a couple of spurts, but ultimately the summer was very quiet and I think that's not surprising given the weather that we saw in Q2 translates through to Q3 for us. September was a noticeable step change in that. And it was very consistent across the portfolio. And so we saw it across all of our businesses. We saw it particularly also in the wholesale channel, which is a great bellwether for the health of the market as our wholesalers going to start to serve that inventory and in the parts of the business that are serving new construction market as well. And it really dovetails with what we're seeing in the macro data. Even in areas which is most exposed to new construction amongst our businesses, we saw positive point of sale across the quarter. And that was largely through a big pickup in September. And so this feels like a much more solid step change than some of the spurts earlier in the year.","Phil Ng","Got it. And then your results in your Doors & Security business, more Security than Doors, have been a bit uneven in the last 18 months or so. How confident are you in getting back on track in the fourth quarter? And tariffs obviously has been a headwind for Security. How are you going to plan to manage it a little more effectively going into next year because you still have some incremental tariffs coming in?","Pat Hallinan","Yes. That's fair. That business does need to perform more evenly. That would be consistent with its demand profile. First of all, the operating challenges that we had last year have been fully behind us this whole year. And so now it's a matter of 2 things. One, regaining the confidence of our customers which we're on a path to do. And this is the one part of our business that has lagged in performance relative to tariff inflation. So that business going into the fourth quarter does have tariff pricing in place. That's a good progress. It will have about $7 million of favorable comps as we head into the fourth quarter, OI comp. And then as it goes into next year, it's about regaining the confidence of customers to put the spin back on the top line. There's good commercial project heading into the fourth quarter of this year. So our confidence around the fourth quarter of this year is around incremental cost actions taken in that business, tariff pricing and project timing in the commercial part of the business. But we're confident going into 2020 that, that business will continue to leverage its strong brand.","Chris Klein","And the Doors business has performed well. I think there is a channel inventory leaning out across both retail and wholesale. That business is heavily exposed to new construction. If you factor those 2 things in, it continues to perform very well at the market level. And as we see inflection up in new construction on the Therma-Tru side, we're going to see the benefit of that in the fourth quarter. It's got a pretty good momentum going into the year. So we're pretty happy with where that business is. And of course, Fiberon is also in that segment. So you see the effect of us investing in that segment ahead of all the demand that we've got coming at us through our distribution expansion, so that's going to roll together.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates.","Justin Speer","And congratulations to you Chris and Nick on your new roles.","Chris Klein","Thank you.","Nick Fink","Thank you.","Justin Speer","I had a big-picture question for you, Nick, and just kind of stepping back and thinking about your view of the portfolio, your midterm targets. If you could step back and maybe give an appraisal of where you think the largest areas for value creation are that maybe aren't well understood by the marketplace.","Nick Fink","Sure. I'd be happy to. Thank you for the question. First, I'll start by just saying I'm honored to have the opportunity to continue to be part of building what is really a great company. If I step back in this role as COO since March, have been working across the segments and looking at additional areas of opportunities that we've got. And what I'm going to do is continue to ensure that we invest in and capture the most exciting of those opportunities.","I'll start with GPG where, as I said earlier, we're going to continue to drive that growth in both our core North American Moen business as well as new horizons like whole home water and continuing to build upon our China business in a very sustainable and profitable way. So a huge opportunity there and more portfolio opportunity as we do things like bring our new House of ROHL concept into market as I spelled out at the start of the year.","The other great exciting spot I think that we haven't quite captured yet is outdoor living opportunity. It's enormous and we're really focused on the expansion of the Fiberon business. As a reminder, share of Weekes is still 82%. And so the opportunity out there is really big. And we're really set on building a strong consumer brand and a competitor in this marketplace that will benefit from these conversion tailwinds as they come on. As you think about it, we start from a really exciting position. Our strength is in value price products. And so we have an opportunity to move actually up the price spectrum. And we're supporting that through our expansion into wholesale, which will support not just the wholesale channel, but it also supports special order retail because special order retail is served through wholesalers. And so that's a second big area where we can really continue to execute upon our substantial wins to date. And you're going to see us investing and adding capacity in order to serve that.","And then I am excited about the progress in our Cabinets pivot plan as we touched on earlier. We're certainly in the back half of that. The steps are, while they remain many, they're actually well underway. And we are moving now to a set of growth initiatives coming off of this advantaged supply chain and we're already seeing progress against those growth initiatives in the marketplace.","And so those are the three big areas. Stepping back a little bit, I'd say, we'll continue to execute upon the strategies we talked about at our Investor Day in February. And as we always have, we're going to continue to stay a step ahead by really evaluating the marketplace and the changes that are coming at us and developing new strategies over time. And then finally to sort of add to that, what Pat talked about, with a pretty robust balance sheet and opportunities for capital deployment, I think you sum all that together and we're feeling pretty excited about what we're coming into in 2020 and beyond.","Justin Speer","That's helpful. And I guess as a follow-up to that, just thinking about these growth investments, you got some investments in the pivot strategy that you're saying is accelerating. And you have some growth investments in the Doors & Security business. And I looked at your full year guidance and that implies kind of an atypical step-up or maybe sequentially stable margin from the third quarter, which is atypically it's kind of a pullback. And I'm just curious how much growth investment took place, if you can maybe unpack that for us for Doors & Security that maybe was underutilized or that maybe doesn't repeat as we think about the go-forward plan.","Pat Hallinan","Yes. Justin, it'd be easier to get your head wrapped around it first thinking about the fourth quarter and then I'll come back to the third quarter because it's much about third quarter investment as it is about some of the transition inefficiencies.","You look at the fourth quarter, you're right. Typically, our margin profile throughout the year as a business, and this is typical of building products is, the second and the third quarters are the highest margin percentages and the shoulders are the lower margin percentages. And your math is correct. This year, the fourth quarter will be among our stronger quarters and be atypically high relative to the second and the third quarter.","To hit the midpoint of our guidance takes a bit more than $28 million of pretax operating income. And right away, we get about $10 million of that comping against both Fiberon purchase accounting and Security service issues from last year. So you get $10 million on comps. You get about $5 million from Plumbing continuing its performance momentum, very much in line with the order rate it's seeing and the cost structure it's been deploying. And then the balance of that performance comes both from Cabinets and the Doors & Security segment. And you look at what those businesses are doing. All 3 of those businesses, Doors, Security and Cabinets took incremental cost actions in the third quarter that will play out in the fourth quarter. Security got tariff pricing and you have new construction coming back, which benefits the volumes in Doors and Cabinets, then you have some commercial project timing in Security. So we're feeling good about where the fourth quarter plays out.","And you're right, it's an atypical rhythm to the quarter. We always knew that this year we'd be absorbing some things in the second and the third quarters that were not typically in our margin profile. We're pivoting our wood product supply chain completely out of China this year. That's forcing us to digest some supply chain inefficiencies and some both tariff and duty goods in the Cabinets business as we do this. We're ramping up 3 plants in Cabinets as we work to both absorb the growth of the Mantra product line and prepare for some plant rationalization going forward. And so those are the types of things that we're digesting in the middle of the year that put pressure on our second and third quarter margins. So we feel good about where we are in the fourth quarter. Yes, it's a stout quarter, but we're all focused on delivering it and we could see a pathway there.","Nick Fink","From a big picture, the way we approach the year and the way we approach quite generally as we're here to create long-term shareholder value. And so as we came into this year, we focused on really, really rigorous expense control while prioritizing key investments that were going to deliver growth over the medium term. And so seeing that come through in the top line that was 6%, 3% organic at improving margins, which is not particularly easy in a tough market, but also some external pressures like tariffs coming at you. But through that, prioritized investments like Moen brand, like Fiberon expansion, like value price point cabinet, all things that are going to continue to drive growth as we come into the next year, particularly we've got a little bit of a tailwind from the market with this sort of re-based expense base that we have with these cost control in these investments. They couple really, really nicely to deliver growth for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","Congrats, Nick, on the promotion. Chris, it's been great working with you. You're not leaving, but maybe taking a step back from the public role.","I have one more granular question and one bigger picture question. Maybe just to start on the granular side, I know you had a couple of questions around this earlier, but I just want to try and build on, if I could, and get a little bit more specific if you're willing.","In terms of a little bit of growth deceleration from 2Q to 3Q, we saw organic growth around 6% in the second quarter going to 3% in the third, and then reaccelerating a little bit in September, October. Chris, I think you described the September pickup as noticeable. I'm just trying to get a sense given the triangulation of the full year guidance delivering 5%, 6% total. If we should be thinking about getting back to that 5%, 6% growth rate in the fourth quarter. And really what I'm getting at is, how much of a pickup really did you see? And if you could even go month by month, just to give us a sense of the magnitude of that pickup and how we should be thinking about 4Q?","Chris Klein","Kind of across the businesses, it's it was significant. It was noticeable in each part of the business as we transition out of August into September and the channels are still pretty lean, so POS was moving, order rates were flowing and that will continue into October. So we feel quite comfortable as we sit here right now and looking out to the full year guidance. Pat, maybe you have a little bit more detail in terms of how it plays out?","Pat Hallinan","Yes. I mean by the fourth quarter, Mike, we will have fully anniversary-ed Fiberon. Fiberon is in the organic sales number for the fourth quarter. And we would expect in the fourth quarter to be seeing reported sales at or above 4% and organic sales at or above 4%. The decking business is really performing strongly as we got through the wet spring and early summer. And not only we see just native demand, but the distribution gain and some of the loads that come with those distribution gain. It would be continued strong performance in Plumbing. Both U.S. POS has been mid-single digits. It finished the quarter stronger than mid-single digits. And we would expect China to stay double digits. And then cabinets will be flat or down slightly. Remember, they're comping against the 53rd week they had in the fourth quarter last year. But we would expect fourth quarter organic sales to be around 4-plus percent, to deliver a year in the range we gave you, the 5% to 6% range.","Michael Rehaut","Appreciate that. Secondly, the bigger picture question, and again I think there was a question earlier about this, but the cabinets leadership change, appreciating succession plans and Dave's desire to retire. But at the same time, it's interesting questions we've received around a prior -- bringing in someone who's a CEO of a public company to lead the division. From that, I guess, really two things that I think most people are trying to understand around this.","Number one, Nick, as you look at Dave coming in, what are the things that you really are hoping to get out of the segment over the next year or 2, both from a top line and margin perspective, given this may still be considered somewhat of a transition year although you're still getting momentum on the value side?","And two, maybe you could address some of the investor questions around potentiality of this as a spin or whether or not over the longer term, it's something you see potentially as not being part of the overall portfolio. Obviously, there's been changes around the cabinets industry and ownership of some of the bigger participants still forthcoming. And so should we be thinking about this leadership transition is a signal that you're kind of -- as part of your overall portfolio, how you're thinking about whether or not this is a permanent fixture.","Nick Fink","Sure. Sure, I'd be happy to address that. I'll start by saying and reiterating the we're really excited to have Dave Banyard come on board. You've got an executive here who's got a blue chip Danaher and Roper manufacturing experience, a proven track record at doubling free cash flow at Myers, and so somebody that we think we've been incredibly fortunate to attract to this business. I think it also speaks to the opportunity in the Cabinets business. You don't attract talent like that to a business that doesn't have real opportunity ahead. And so I'd start with that as the baseline.","What would we expect? What we would expect to see Dave Banyard bring us some external view, not from the cabinet industry. So he's going to bring us some external view on some best-in-class manufacturing and commercial leadership from his experience. So we're going to marry that with the deep cabinet experience that the rest of our team has. And from that, we expect to see elevated pivot and results with that as we push towards higher margins coming out the business. And we expect to see us really taking advantage of what we believe are significant growth opportunities in the marketplace coming from that value segment to which we believe we are incredibly well positioned now having built out the capacity which we will continue to build and having these new product launches come into the market that you're already seeing be really, really well received. And so we think it's actually an incredible time to have a new leader come in, perhaps give us a bit more fresh perspective and then drive the kind of performance that we've seen Dave Banyard drive in the other businesses that he's led across his career. So all that is a great backdrop.","Now what I'll say and besides the rest of the question is, we have a great set of businesses and we work them very, very hard. And against that, we're seeing some increasing success. And if the market improves, we're going to see more success. And with that being in the back half of this pivot plan, we expect to see results both on the cost piece and on some of the growth initiatives and we're really excited about those opportunities ahead. It is deeply embedded within our DNA at Fortune Brands to drive shareholder value. And we have always and we will always continue to assess all avenues to create value when the right opportunities arise. And so we will see ourselves rewarded for driving value and improving this business, and we will find a path to do so.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed for some time to address questions that you may have.","I will now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams delivered solid sales and earnings growth in the first quarter, which was on plan and met our overall expectations. This was in spite of the challenging weather across the Midwest and East Coast versus last year's milder winter.","We also had inflationary input cost across our businesses that we are pricing for, and we will see more of the benefit in margin expansion as the year unfolds. Our business has performed well overall, and the results in our Global Plumbing Group were outstanding.","Based on the strong momentum we see in our Global Plumbing Group, share gains in Doors and Security and our accelerated set of actions to pivot our Cabinet business, which should drive more value in the second half of the year and into next year, we took advantage of the pullback in our share price, and we purchased a significant amount of our stock in the first four months of the year. I will return to the subject of capital deployment in a moment.","Let me first spend some time on our view of the U.S. home products market. Next, I will provide my perspective on our business performance in the first quarter. Pat will then provide more details on our first quarter performance and 2018 outlook.","Starting with our view of the U.S. home products market. In the first quarter, the market for our home products was slightly below the pace we planned. We estimate that repair-and-remodel activity grew between 4% and 5% and that new construction grew mid-single digits, slightly below our full-year expectation of high-single digits.","The weather impact in the quarter, both on bigger ticket R&R and new construction, appears to be transitory, and our demand indicators remain strong. So our full-year outlook for both new construction and R&R remains unchanged as we head into the busy spring selling and construction season.","Now, let me provide some perspective on our business performance. For the first quarter, sales increased 6% in total. Total company operating margin was similar to last year at roughly 10% as inflationary pressures were a headwind in all segments as anticipated.","Operating margin is still expected to improve as we move through the year, particularly in the second half, as our pricing actions typically lag and many products are now shipping with price increases that offset the higher input costs that the industry is facing.","Beginning with our Plumbing segment, we saw a strong performance from our most significant earnings engine, the GPG. Sales were up 19% for the quarter. Organic sales were up over 16%, with strong double-digit growth running ahead of the market across all channels, including wholesale, retail, Canada and China.","We saw a significant share gains across all markets as a result of the strategy shift and management changes we initiated in 2016. And the new management team continues to execute and build momentum even with weather-related headwinds in many U.S. and Canadian markets.","POS was strong in the quarter, and inventories look healthy moving forward as our channel partners more fully embrace the value that our GPG platform brings to their customers. The performance we are seeing is being driven by coordinated strategy.","Taking a broader portfolio of products and brands into our existing market-leading channel positions across North America and China; growing a newer less penetrated sales channels such as hospitality; accelerating the portfolio with a more rapid pace of innovation; making more targeted investments in brand building; and leveraging more sophisticated channel capabilities, particularly in data analytics and e-commerce, where we continue to invest.","The impact of these actions can be seen in our sales growth and share gains, our strong mix and our improving margins. Operating margin was solid and a little above our expectations for the first quarter as pricing actions and a better mix offset some of the inflation pressure and the increased investment spending are leveraging to drive sales growth above market. We will continue to position our Plumbing business for accelerated growth, consistent with our strategy.","We're excited by the recent performance and long-term potential of the Global Plumbing Group, which has been building momentum over the last four quarters. And our broader band lineup is delivering results.","Our recent acquisitions such as ROHL, Riobel, Perrin & Rowe, Shaws and Victoria + Albert are all performing well. And we have been successful going to market with this collection under the new channel concept, the House of ROHL, which our channels are embracing.","In summary, our GPG strategy is working really well. The new team is executing at a very high level, and our Plumbing business has reemerged as the next big driver of earnings growth for our company.","In our Doors business, sales were up 8% against a strong first quarter comp from last year as we continue to take share in the door market. Sustained share gains and mix improvements contributed to the strong performance in Doors, which was driven by low-double-digit growth by big builders in the wholesale channel.","Retail sales also continued to grow and were up low double digits as well after adjusting for the prior year inventory load-in associated with retail wins. These results would have been even stronger but for the weather headwinds in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic and the prior year inventory load.","The team also faced commodity pressures but has rolled in price increases that will more fully leverage as the year unfolds. Similar to our Plumbing Group, we have a relatively new Doors leadership team that has been upgrading its management talent across functions since 2016.","They have refined their strategy, invested in new technology and innovation center and are delivering more rapid and sophisticated innovation and enhanced product offerings. As a result, the Doors team has continued to outperform the market and gain share by driving innovation in wholesale and retail, leveraging their distribution strength and refreshing targeted parts of the product portfolio.","Sales from new product introductions at the high end of the fiberglass line were up double digits in the quarter and we're seeing strong sales tied to our new composite edge products and industry-leading door systems as well.","We're evaluating new ways to continue to grow our Doors business aggressively, both through acquisition opportunities and new internal initiatives.","In the Security segment, sales were solid and increased 4% from the prior year despite a strong comp and the headwind from winding down a non-core commercial line that we chose to exit in the middle of last year.","Our core retail and commercial lines were up over 6% growing faster than the market. The growth was driven by solid sales in U.S. retail and commercial channels, which includes industrial accounts and security distributors.","Retailers have been responding positively to our new product refreshers and combination locks, stainless steel padlocks and safes.","The commercial channel is seeing strong pull-through from accounts with their presence in the construction market. In our Safes business, we continue to expand capacity in our new manufacturing facility.","Margins were roughly even with prior year and impacted by inflation, but we continue to expect margins to improve in the back half of the year as price covers the input cost pressures we are experiencing.","Before I transition to Cabinets, let me share some quick perspectives on our overall portfolio and the thought process through the early part of this year. As I just described, we see significant strength and momentum inside of our Plumbing, Doors, and Security businesses which represent two-thirds of the earnings power of our company.","These businesses are running a bit ahead of our plan despite the weather and inflationary headwinds in the quarter. In Cabinets, the market continues to evolve in terms of consumer preferences, price points and labor constraints.","We have successfully navigated the changes in the cabinet market over the last decade by refocusing our product lineup, supply chain, and customer service to address the needs of the consumer and our channels and from time-to-time have pulled back from the parts of the market that have become less attractive.","As a result, you have seen us accelerate growth and gap up to the next margin threshold after each period of transition. We are now in the middle of one of those transition periods and are actively setting up the next wave of growth and margin expansion to achieve 14% operating margin with consistent mid-single-digit sales growth.","More specifically, since our fourth quarter call, we have accelerated our plans for the strategic pivot in our Cabinet business and pulled forward some of our repositioning and restructuring actions.","We believe these actions will play out over the rest of the year, begin to add value in the back half of the year and into 2019, and set us up nicely to capture profitable growth and expanded margins to 14% over the next three to four years.","We have begun by investing and increasing capacity to support growth in the areas where we are already taking share and where more predictable volumes will flow in the Cabinet business over the next few years.","At the same time we are reducing capacity for some slices of business in the U.S. and Canada in order to align our cost base to the potential we see in these areas which will result in some one-time charges in the second quarter.","The impact of these actions, both the capacity reductions and business exits, should improve margins going forward and eliminate some of the top-line drag in these underperforming areas.","When repositioned, we'll have a healthier mix of business going through our industry-leading dealer network, our key wholesale partners and our builder relationships, and an expanded margin profile as we leverage our unique supply chain advantages.","In terms of the first quarter results in Cabinets, where normal winter weather, inflation in tariffs impacted Cabinets more than our other businesses. Storms caused multiple plant closures throughout the quarter, resulting in some operating inefficiencies and more typical operating leverage in the first quarter, most of which was already anticipated and in our plan as we were comping against a mild 2017.","Sales overall were up 1%, adjusting for our exits. Our core dealer business was down slightly and was tied directly to accounts impacted by weather slowdowns, primarily in the Northeast and Midwest, as our dealer business in the South and West was much stronger. Our core in-stock cabinets and vanities business was also strong, with good POS.","As previously discussed, we have increased prices and pulled back on promotional activity to offset input costs, which is currently playing out through our channels. The net result of the softer first quarter, coupled with pricing and accelerated restructuring actions in the first half, is that we now see our Cabinet results accelerating more significantly in the second half of 2018.","I am confident that the results of our actions should begin adding value in the second half of this year and set us up well for the next three to four years of sales growth with higher margins than we enjoy in Cabinets today.","So to recap the quarter overall. Results were solid and met our expectations in total. We again executed well in the U.S. home products market that ran a little below our plan due to weather. Our teams did an excellent job of growing our company sales and holding the line on margin until price has a more meaningful impact in the back half of the year.","Before I wrap up, let me return to our capital deployment in the quarter and our broader plan to create long-term incremental value. Year-to-date through April, we have spent $400 million on share repurchases for about 6.4 million shares. We feel good about our 2018 outlook and are comfortable with our plans to drive value over the next three years.","We're also engaged in active discussions with a number of potential acquisition targets. And the volume and pace of activity remains elevated.","While the timing is uncertain, some capital deployment against M&A is likely to occur in the next 12 months. In terms of targets, we're assessing a number of opportunities across our businesses. And we also continue to evaluate the possibility of adding a new home product segment or category where we do not have a presence today.","Regarding share repurchases. We plan to continue to use them opportunistically as a vehicle to generate attractive returns, consistent with prior practice. Using our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we have the capacity and flexibility to make strategic acquisitions, repurchase additional shares, and increase our dividend to create meaningful incremental shareholder value.","As a reminder, over the next three years, we continue to believe that we have the potential to deploy an additional $2.5 billion to drive incremental growth and shareholder value.","So to sum up, the demand for our home products remains solid, as we expected, and our year remains on track despite more normal winter weather. I'm encouraged by the strong momentum in the GPG and by our continued success in Doors and Security. I'm also encouraged by the pace of execution on our plans to drive long-term value in our Cabinet business and believe that all of our businesses have taken the right actions to address the pickup in inflation that we are seeing.","So based on how things are progressing, we feel more confident in our full-year performance. We are maintaining our current sales outlook and increasing our EPS outlook based on share repurchase activity. We will further revisit our outlook on our second quarter call after assessing the key spring and early summer selling seasons.","Long-term, we see continued solid demand for housing and home products, and our businesses are well-positioned to capture that demand. Plus, we will likely have an opportunity to add some businesses along the way.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Pat, who will review our financial performance and provide detail on our EPS outlook for 2018.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, to best reflect ongoing business performance, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains for continuing operation.","Let me start with our first quarter results. Sales were $1.3 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $124 million, up 5% or over $6 million compared to the same quarter last year. Total company operating margin was 9.9%, roughly even with last year. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 50 basis points of operating margin improvement for the year.","EPS were $0.56 for the quarter versus $0.53 the same quarter last year, an increase of 6%. EPS met our expectations in the quarter, and we were pleased by our team's ability to grow earnings during a period of elevated inflation and a more challenging winter.","Now, let me provide more color on our segment results. Beginning with Plumbing, sales for the first quarter were $450 million, up $71 million or 19%, with share gains and our GPG strategy driving strong double-digit growth across all channels. Excluding acquisitions, sales were up strong double digits in the quarter, rising over 16%.","Plumbing operating income increased to $92 million, up 33%. Operating margin was 20.5% and came in above our initial expectation, driven by strong leverage on our sales and share gains.","We are taking our full-year Plumbing sales outlook up based on the strong Q1 performance. Versus our original outlook of high-single-digit growth, we now expect full-year Plumbing sales in the low-double-digits range, exclusive of any further acquisition, with margin performance at or slightly above 21%.","Door sales were $110 million, up $8 million or 8% from the prior year quarter, driven by strong wholesale growth with big builders and continued share gains. Operating income increased $6 million and was up 73%. Operating margin for this segment was 12.5%, a 470 basis point increase from the prior year, as strong sales leverage and favorable mix resulted in first quarter margin above our expectations.","For the full year, we expect Door sales to continue to outpace the market. Given our strong start to the year and the back-end weighted nature of our strategic expansion to retail, we now expect to achieve the high end of our original sales outlook for Doors. For the full year, we now anticipate Door sales in the low-double-digit range, with continued strong operating margin well above 15%.","Security sales were $137 million in the first quarter, up 4%. Sales were impressive in the quarter as we comped to a growth rate of over 7% last year and considering the wind-down of a single non-core commercial line we exited last year. Segment operating income was flat at $15 million due to inflation, and the operating margin was 11.1%. For the full year, we continue to expect operating margin of over 16% in Security, with sales growth in the mid-single digits.","In Cabinets, sales for the first quarter were $557 million, down $16 million or 3% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the home center business, we exited at the beginning of this year and select low-margin Canadian business we exited in the middle of last year, Cabinet sales were up 1%. Excluding business exits, sales of in-stock cabinets and vanities grew high single digits on continued solid demand despite lower customer traffic due to weather.","Builder sales were up low single digits despite a clear impact on new construction activity in the Midwest and East where we have a significant portion of our business. Dealer sales were off by low single digits on lower new construction activity and showroom traffic due to weather.","Home center special order and sales in Canada were also down, reflecting the impact of our pullback on promotions. In Cabinets, where we anticipated a challenging first half, operating income in the quarter was $24 million, down 49%.","Operating margin was 4.3%. Given the accelerated strategic changes Chris described earlier, we now expect full-year sales growth and operating margin in Cabinet to be slightly lower than expected at the start of the year. For the full year, we now expect cabinet sales to be up low single digits, with operating margin around 11%.","To sum up consolidated first quarter performance. Sales increased 6%, and EPS were on plan at $0.56, overcoming a challenging comp to a milder winter and widespread inflation. Our total company operating margin was 9.9%, similar to last year despite the headwind.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our March 31 balance sheet remains solid with cash of $244 million, debt of $1.9 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.9 times. We currently have over $600 million remaining on our $1.25 billion revolver, and we continue to have substantial capacity and flexibility to fund potential acquisitions and repurchase additional shares as we move into the higher cash flow-generating quarters of the year.","Year-to-date, we have repurchased over 6.4 million shares for approximately $400 million. Our approach to share repurchase continues to be opportunistic and focused on where we can generate significant returns. We have approximately $160 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","Turning last to the details of our outlook for 2018. As Chris mentioned, we are increasing our 2018 EPS outlook to the range of $3.58 to $3.70 versus $3.08 last year due to strong business performance in the first quarter and our share repurchase activity.","We are encouraged by the positive demand signals we continue to see in the U.S. housing market and our business performance. The important spring selling season, especially after this more normal winter, we'll inform any further update to guidance at the end of the second quarter.","We expect 2018 free cash flow of $525 million to $550 million with a conversion rate of over 90%. The annual EPS outlook includes the following assumptions: Interest expense of around $63 million, tax rate of approximately 25%, and average fully diluted shares of approximately 150 million.","In summary, we are off to a good start to 2018. Demand indicators remain strong, and we delivered solid sales and earnings despite inflation and weather impacts across our categories. We remain well-positioned to use our balance sheet and cash flow to drive incremental shareholder value through acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. I will now pass the call back to Brian.","Brian C. Lantz - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks Pat. That concludes our prepared remarks on the first quarter of 2018. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then re-enter the queue to ask additional questions.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hi.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","My first question is just on Plumbing. I mean, obviously, you're continuing to outpace the market there, very impressive. Can you just give us some color on was some of this outperformance led by certain price point or a certain brand within that group and maybe what you're seeing in terms of some of the more recent acquisitions that you've done, how those have been performing?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, it was really widespread, and that's what's impressive about it. We saw a momentum building in Plumbing over the last few quarters, and it kind of came to ahead this quarter. But the business overall has just got a lot of momentum across all channels across the U.S., Canada, China, wholesale, retail. And I guess, I'd step back and say it really is a byproduct of the changes we made going back 2016. The new strategy we've put in place, new management we've put in place. And the premise is, can we bring more brands and more products through our industry-leading channels across wholesale, retail, China? And that's what we've been doing over the last almost two years.","Some of it is the success of the acquisitions, so all the new acquired businesses are performing very well in and of themselves, but then we're bringing them through channels. And some of the new styles and innovations are coming out of the acquisitions, so we're spreading that across the portfolio. Branding is really kicking in, and the new branding messages are more targeted and more impactful. We're investing in e-commerce and social media, and that's paying back.","So it was kind of \u2013 I was looking for weakness across the whole portfolio in Plumbing, and there was not in the first quarter. I think it is real momentum. And if you look at our strength in our channels, we have a large part of the top 80 builders. We don't disclose the exact number, but it is a considerable amount of that market, very strong in wholesale, very strong in retail. The innovation engine has accelerated at this point. We're pushing more and more through there.","So it all kind of came together, and I'd say it sets us up and orders look good right now. So it's rolling through. Inventories are healthy. I just \u2013 I think we're in a really good spot there. And obviously, the margins are strong. We took pricing coming out of the fourth quarter, really starting in the fourth quarter. And maybe we're a little ahead of the market. And so it started to kick in, in the first quarter. It's going to come more into the second quarter and second half on pricing. Our margin was good. There's still some pricing that's building up in the channel.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, well, that all sounds like a good place to be. In terms of raising the guidance, obviously, it's impressive, especially given the inflation that you and a lot of your peers have been seeing. Can you just give us some sense of the magnitude of the increase in costs that you saw in the quarter, what you're thinking going forward? And then maybe just any details or further details around some of the pricing actions that you're taking?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, I'll start, and I'll let Pat give you a little more color. But I'd say, we were clear eyed coming into the year, and we saw the commodity increases coming at us. They picked up a little bit more in the first quarter, but we were in the midst of pricing actions as we exited the fourth quarter and came into the year. So some of what you're seeing in the businesses reflect that. But Pat maybe can give a little bit more detail.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, I would echo that first that we expected a lot of inflation not just in 2018 but also in 2017. And so our teams were very clear eyed about this year and remain so. We had some pricing actions that started last year. Some that came in the early part of this year. And with some of the additional inflation that we're seeing that will play out the balance of the year, we fully expect pricing within 2018 to cover the inflation we have within 2018.","As Chris said, there'll be some more building throughout the back half of the year. And so as it's fully in place by the back half of the year, that's when you'll see more of the margin expansion that gets driven by our innovation or our mix enhancements. And you'll still see a bit of headwinds through the first part of the year.","But as you saw from our first quarter results, we take very seriously consistent margin delivery. And given both the weather and the inflation we faced in the first quarter, our teams did a great job holding the overall portfolio margin. And we certainly expect our margin performance to build throughout the year, and you'll see most of that benefit come in the second half.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Thank you. Good luck.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hi Michael.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I had a first question just on some of the changes around guidance. And perhaps, I'm doing the quick back-of-the-envelope math incorrectly. So maybe you can provide some clarity. With the reduction in the share count from 155 million to 150 million due to the share repurchase, I'm coming up with that being a $0.12 per share benefit. Yet you raised the full-year guidance by only $0.04. At the same time, you had \u2013 it looks like you reiterated the sales growth as well as the expectation for 50 bps of consolidated margin expansion. So I'm kind of confused where \u2013 what's happened to the other $0.08. I would have thought that, perhaps, with some of the near-term issues with Cabinets, the $0.08 would have been explained by some of the shorter-term issues there. But perhaps you can help me with that.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Mike, it's Pat. First of all, we will have about $14 million, $15 million of incremental interest expense associated with those share repurchases. So when you look at share repurchases net of incremental interest, you're kind of in the $0.07 to $0.08 range. So our guidance going up $0.04 gives you half to more than half of what we'd expect for the year.","And as we mentioned, we feel good about the year and our business. We're waiting to see how the spring plays out. And then when we get to the end of the second quarter, we'll see if additional revisions are merited. But we're feeling good about our business, and we feel like we're biased towards the upside.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And thanks, I didn't catch that on the interest. I guess, second question, a lot of \u2013 there's been a lot of focus, as all of you guys know, around Cabinets. And fantastic, fantastic results on Plumbing without a doubt.","But on the flip side, I think the first quarter adds a little momentum to some of the more skeptical out there or bearish on the Cabinet segment. Maybe you could go into a little more detail in terms of what drove the margin drop in the quarter. You'd mentioned the plant closures as one. And how you're thinking about 2Q and the actions that are in place or set to be \u2013 set to play out over the next few months to get to the 11% margin and the, what I'd assume is, pretty strong improvement in the back half.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. So I'd start with our plan coming in the first quarter was for the margin compression. Last year our 8% margin was pretty unique in the first quarter. The Cabinet business typically doesn't perform very well because of the fixed costs that we're carrying throughout the year.","So as you know, seasonally, December, January, February in building products is \u2013 it was a difficult winter. You're just not getting that much volume come through. So that's what we planned for.","And we had a little rougher February, March than we would have anticipated. And so that definitely impacted on the operating leverage in that business. So that was one piece of it that kind of came through. There was a little bit more commodity pressure as well.","But in general, the quarter played through okay on the dealer side of the business, which is 50% of the business. You were down low single. All of that came on the East Coast and Midwest. The rest of the country was actually up pretty nicely mid-single.","In-stock vanities and cabinets were up high single. So we were pretty encouraged by that. And our direct-to-builder business, again, in the places where the weather was impacting it, were down a bit. But overall, were quite strong.","So really, it's the restructured parts of the business, which are Canada, which we've talked a bit about and we're zeroing in on the parts of that market that we like and exiting some of that market. And then we've talked about some of the home center business that we've pulled away from on special order side only.","And so that's kind of the setup on the revenue side, both the quarter and how the year is going to play out. I mean again, it's integrated in our plan.","On the restructuring side, we'll go into a little bit more of that in the second quarter \u2013 after the second quarter results. But effectively, we're investing in the stuff that's selling really well. And so we're taking share in the parts of the market that are, perhaps, simpler product lines, going through dealer into builder, the in-stock vanities, cabinets. There's a lot of demand there. And so we're putting more capacity in there across North America. So that includes our operations in Mexico, and so some of that is just lower cost actually (34:28).","And then we're taking capacity out of those parts of the market that have been softer. Really, we've been talking about kind of the middle parts of the market being softer over the last four or five quarters. And so we're taking some costs out of that, some fixed costs out of that. Won't go into more detail on that.","And so you're going to see basically a leverage shift inside that business. And it's going to set up around where there's good growth in the business inside of our portfolio.","So obviously, as we're moving through things, less certainty about a straight line, but this is kind of how we've run the Cabinet business since 2009. When I came into the business, we were losing money and we started pivoting around stuff that was working and cutting the stuff that wasn't.","And we've been through expansion from 0% to 3% margin to 7% margin to 11% margin. And now we're pivoting to go up to 14% margin over the next few years. And it's all inside of the envelope of the business that we've got and the channels that we've got.","So I sit here today more comfortable than I was a couple quarters ago because our teams are executing harder. And I can see kind of where the impact is coming. There are big chunks of our business that are delivering those margins today. And what I'm sharing with you is clear out those parts of the business that haven't been performing and, frankly, weighing it down.","So I think we're in a pretty good spot and feel good about it. I understand kind of where there's some anxiety around it. But also put it in perspective, it's one-third of the earnings power of our company. The other two-thirds, I think had a pretty good quarter, and it's setting up for a real good year and running ahead of plan.","And so in that context, with the kind of significance of things we're doing, I actually feel really good about where our Cabinets business sits right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Hi. Thank you, guys. Chris, just continuing on your commentary on Cabinets. So going back to your opening remarks, where 14% is still the bogey, but it sounds like it's a little bit further out. Is the right way to think of it is that the restructurings will happen this year, you'll be around 11% this year. And then you're looking at roughly 100 basis points a year? So it's 3 years or after that you'd aim to achieve that 14%?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, that looks pretty good. So 11%, maybe a little bit more, depending on how quickly things move through and where the leverage comes from.","And then we're in a good flying formation as we move through 2019. And so you'll start to see that leverage.","Again, kind of think about it as additions and subtractions, subtractions off the cost base, which clearly will improve leverage, subtractions off parts of the portfolio that were dragging on the top-line and just were not growing kind of sequentially.","And then doubling down in parts of the market where we're growing and taking share. So the in-stock cabinets and vanities business has been growing robustly over the last 2, 3 years, taking share, growing strong inside of our dealer business, strong builder business. So we have direct-to-builder, but we also do a lot of builder business through the dealers. And that product portfolio, we're adding some additional product lines too. So that's going to continue to grow. And then our direct-to-builder business, that's 80% of our revenue is kind of right inside of that sweet spot.","And then as we've talked about before, we're restructuring part of Canada, we were kind of wide and thin across a lot of Canada and we just try to narrow in more on where we've got real strength and pull out of some parts of the market that we're more kind of on the fringe. So...","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. And then on price versus raw materials, it sounds like you're neutral across the portfolio for the full year. But I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you give a number for where you were in the first quarter? And then just a sense of what does the trajectory of that recovery look like? How heavy is the recovery in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year versus something that maybe is more moderate through the year?","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Dennis, Q1, Q2 price will trail inflation a bit. Think about it in terms of somewhere between $5 million and $10 million portfolio-wide. But by the time we enter the second \u2013 exit the second quarter rather, we'll be covering it fully. And so it'll be a bit of a headwind. The first part of the year, it differs by product line and by months because the effects by product line and the price increase is going in differ. But by the second quarter, we'll be neutralizing it fully. And therefore, the productivity gains we're making in our businesses, the innovation and the mix improvements will show through and be driving margin expansion in the back half of the year.","Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC","Okay. Appreciate it, Pat. Thank you, guys.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Eisen with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Michael Eisen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good afternoon, guys.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hi.","Michael Eisen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Was hoping you guys could start off talking a little bit about the Doors segment, pretty good results coming through. You guys talked about outgrowing the market. Can you talk about how much you're outgrowing the market? And I think you mentioned a new retail placement that should accelerate growth in the back half of the year. Can you give a little more color on that as well?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Sure. Yes, I think we're \u2013 I won't give \u2013 put an exact number in terms of how far ahead of the market we are, but we're clearly taking share, running better than kind of if you look at the other public newer companies. Our growth has exceeded theirs, and it's going to continuing as we look at where we're taking it. A lot of that's coming out of the wholesale side of the market. So that's builder market.","Door business is about 50:50 new construction, R&R. Our whole portfolio is more like 65 R&R, 35 new construction. So it's tilted more towards new construction. And so we're doing better with bigger builders and through our wholesale channels. Some of that's also just innovation. So at the higher end of the market, we're driving more product there at higher price point. So we're taking share on that basis as well.","In retail, we've got a really strong long-term relationship with Lowe's, and we just continue to expand that relationship. And so that's been a lot of success we've had there, and we continue to work closely with them, real partnership to drive a lot of growth with them kind of across all their price points and working closely to try to drive them in the category.","So that's worked really well. So it's a combination of innovation and just channel strength across business. Great team there and they really ramped up the innovation side of that business. And now you're seeing that it took a little while. It was always kind of up and along, but we really pushed it hard in the last 18 months, and you're kind of seeing that flow through the market.","Michael Eisen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, I know, that's encouraging, and I appreciate all the color. And then just a quick follow-up. You guys both mentioned that the idea of some more M&A coming in the next 12 to 18 months and kind of the potential for another leg to the story. Can you talk about a little where you're comfortable with leverage at this point of the cycle and how we can see that potentially playing into the size of a deal you're able to do here?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Sure. So I'd say, we're active and looking at things, and we're just in the midst of a number of different things. Our primary focus is inside of the businesses that we've got because we get the best leverage if it's inside of one of the four parts of the business that we've got. So there are things that we're working on right now across those businesses that could materialize here. And so we'd be pretty excited about that.","In terms of another category, we've looked at other things that are similar to what we're in today. Heavy consumer involvement, so not commodity-building products but more consumer home products where the innovation that we're really good at can play through channel strength, really matters. You got pricing power, which clearly we do, that demonstrate. So there are some categories that look like that, and so we visit those as well.","I'd say for where we're at in the cycle, I mean, we spend a lot of time looking at a lot of forward indicators around demographics and household formation and where the building cycle is. And so we're comfortable that the things aren't going to stop here anytime soon, understanding interest rates are rising and some other things. But in terms of overall leverage, we'll be appropriately conservative, but we've got a lot of headroom inside of the cash flow ahead of us. We throw off a lot of cash. Left on our own, we'd be delevering pretty quickly. Pat, I don't know if you want to comment a little bit more just on kind of how we think about leverage.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. The 1.9 times that we finished Q1 is a little bit of a fall seco. It's a correct number, but we produced most of our cash from May through December. And so the headline might grab as if we're high leveraged right now, but absent any further capital deployment for the year, we'd finish the year at 1.3 times.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","So we're going to try not to do that.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","We're going to try not to do that, but we have \u2013 so we feel like we have plenty of room. I wouldn't anchor on the March 31 leverage ratio and think that it's an indication of where we'll spend most of the year.","Michael Eisen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. I was actually more so looking to how high you're comfortable going for the right deal.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","I think we've kind of probably got a natural target at about 2.5, but I think if it was a right deal, especially if it was synergistic and fit within one of the businesses, so near end, very high probability of synergies flowing, which is what we've seen in some of the things that we've done already, it could go a little bit of above that. And then you're paying it down pretty quickly because our core business is throwing off a lot of cash.","And if it was in our wheelhouse, you'd probably see some pretty quick delevering going on, too. So, I don't know that we've got a number but I think we've got a lot of capacity to do the things that we want to do and kind of the things that we're considering looking at now. And especially in sequence, we don't do everything \u2013 if we did something in the next six months, you're paying down all along the way. And then if you did something else six months after that, it's kind of on cycle with the earnings that you're acquiring.","Michael Eisen - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Appreciate all the color.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey guys.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hi.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","When you think about a fifth leg, would that potentially be a larger deal in size and some of the things that you're looking that are more similar to what you're doing right now? Are they bolt-on and I just wanted some color around that?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it is probably bigger than just a bolt-on that we've maybe done before or a mid-sized deal and that we'd want a leadership position in whatever we are going in. I don't like the idea of playing on the fringe of a market that we haven't been in historically.","So we'd be pretty clear eyed about that and make sure that we come into something where we could establish just a strong position right out of the gate and it's close enough in terms of understanding consumer behaviors in our sector and what consumers are responding to as we see some commonality across our businesses and how they're thinking about their homes and what they're emphasizing.","And so if we can translate that into another consumer involved category, in a leadership position, by definition, that's probably a little bit bigger. So we are not going to bet the ranch, nobody should be worried about that but that probably means that you're on a little bit larger size.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And Chris, I couldn't help but notice how excited you are about some of the efforts you made in Plumbing and you're obviously seeing a lot of momentum there. Just trying to gauge when we think about this business historically, it's we view it more as a mid-single-digit growth business. You're clearly outpacing that, but just trying to gauge how sustainable this growth trajectory is for the next few years. Is the new normal more high-single-digit growth? Any color would be very helpful. Thanks.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. So going back to kind of last, really, 18 months ago, summer fall of 2016, we started talking very clearly about holding margin in that business between 21% and 22% margin and investing in growth and started making very conscious decisions in investing in products, investing in brand, investing in technology, data analytics, e-commerce, a lot of things that were really set up to drive growth across multiple fronts. And it was with a leash on spending, which is the deal is we could have accelerated margin, but we're better off if we can get above-market growth at 21%, 21.5%. And they've been able to deliver, and I think that's where the excitement is. It's in the excitement that if you look at \u2013 actually, four \u2013 last four quarters, you can see sequentially performance relative to the four quarters before that, picking up 8%, 8.3%, 8.6%.","Now against last year's first quarter, up much stronger organically 16%. But yeah, we'll be in the low teens this year, and I think you should expect we're going to grow a couple of percent more than the market overall. And there'll be pockets of that market that will be even stronger because what we're doing is working.","And so that's \u2013 I guess the excitement comes from is it a lot \u2013 it isn't one big thing. It's a lot of concrete pieces of a strategy that are again \u2013 executed against a higher-caliber team they brought in a lot more talent there and align that team with a great culture \u2013 a performance-driven culture. And that's what's happening a lot of people talk about all that stuff and frankly, that's what I was doing was talking if I go back 18 months ago. And now you can actually see it playing through. So, I guess that's what you're picking up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. This is Josh Chan filling in for Tim.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Hi Josh.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. If I could piggyback on the Plumbing growth, could you just kind of go through different channels or verticals, however you want to describe this, kind of where you think you are underpenetrated because presumably those are the areas that you have a better runway for above-market growth?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. So you could \u2013 I'll take it across, you look at North America, U.S. and Canada, where we've been market leader overall for a while. Across wholesale, within the wholesale market, you've got our builder business, which we've got an extraordinary share of the top 80 builders.","And as we bring a broader product portfolio into those relationships, they responded well. So this would be in addition to Moen and bring some of the acquisitions into that channel. And so as they're building higher-end communities, taking some of our higher-end brands and bringing them into those communities, so that's extending that out. And so that's playing through in retail, taking a broader product portfolio.","So we've acquired disposals, we've acquired some other adjacencies within that category. So it's putting more through that part of the market.","And then in e-commerce, we've made a lot of investments there. We've been growing really over the last 18 months at a pretty strong clip. And it's \u2013 there, I think it's being conscious of the other channels and being conscious of what's selling well. It's incredibly data-driven.","We've got very, very talented people. Again, we upgraded that team over the last couple years. We're on par with anybody in the sector and working closely with all of our channel partners there to really make folks successful and bring more products through that channel that's selling well.","China, very interesting case there. Where they're really just expanding the whole room in terms of bathroom and kitchen in China. Very aggressive at taking not just stuff that we own but partnering in other categories, in shower surrounds, in toilets and other categories that we don't own anything. Partnering with them and bringing whole suite solutions into our 1,000 locations in China and then also selling more into the builders there.","And that builder channel is growing much more quickly, as builders are starting to behave in China more like they've been in the U.S. where they're finishing out the entire kitchen and bathroom as opposed to leaving them as shells. So that part of the market is growing pretty aggressively.","So when I said earlier, it's kind of across the waterfront, it's kind of across each of those channels. And then within there, it's at the price points where we play. Where Moen plays in the heart of the market and we've been strong with Moen, taking share, playing strong in the heart of the market. And then a lot of our acquisitions are filling out those other parts of the market, where we didn't have a big presence in more of the premium side of the market.","But then there's designs and there's product functionality that we can borrow from and bring into part of the market, Moen, finishes, styles, things that start in the leading edge of the market. Lower volumes, but it's where the designers spend all their time. And then bringing those design cues and those product innovations into the heart of the market. And that's kind of how the markets evolve.","In terms of new channels opening up, I'd just point out hospitality, which is big hotels and also kind of mixed properties where you've got hotels and higher level multifamily in single projects. That was a market that, just as Moen, we had to chip away, chip away, chip away.","Now with the portfolio that we've got, we can walk in with a full bag into any project out there and go head-to-head with anybody in the market. And fill it in then with a combination of both our, ROHL, Riobel, Perrin & Rowe, Victoria + Albert product and then bring in Moen in those other parts of the project, where typically you could expect a Moen. But if you're not in there, talking with the designer and the architect, you weren't getting kind of their full audience. Well, that's happening now.","And that's starting to flow through the business, you're starting to see it in the revenue, but the number of projects teed up behind right now is starting to accumulate, too. And so that's exciting because you're taking a market-leading position, and then you're trying to penetrate parts of the market that we knew we weren't getting our fair share. But now with this bigger portfolio, we'll be able to execute there.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. That's definitely very good to see the strong execution there in the Plumbing side. If I can ask about the Cabinets business, just in terms of setting the expectations for next quarter. So typically, I think, in Q2, you have kind of a margin that is above the full-year average. But given the run rate from Q1, I just wanted to ask about, are there any guideposts that you want to give us in terms of Q2 Cabinet margins, that would be really helpful. Thank you.","Patrick D. Hallinan - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. We don't \u2013 we try not to give the specifics across quarters. You will still see both Q2 and Q3 margins above the full-year average in Cabinets. But we'll have some transition going on there as well. So Cabinets, for the second quarter, will probably be a little bit below last year. But it will be above the full-year margin, and it will be significantly above where it was in the first quarter.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Great. Thank you for your time.","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Perfect.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for getting me in here. Chris, maybe just from a high level. I mean, you talked about changing consumer preferences in the Cabinets business and how you're kind of evolving the Fortune business as you've done in the past to kind of target that next wave of growth.","What, in your opinion, does that next wave of growth look like? And maybe on top of that, is there anything that's changing from a competitive standpoint that's impacting the industry's dynamics?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's an interesting time in the market, and I would go back to I've kind of watched this thing unfold over almost a decade.","And you're in a period right now where it's less competitive dynamic. It's more we've talked about constraints around labor, and we've talked about simpler designs. And so that starts to translate into consumers behaving in a way where, okay, if it's going to take me a little bit longer, and I'm going to have to struggle to get a more complex design, and there's cleaner looks out in the market today in any event, then maybe I'll move to a more simplistic part of that market. That's for part of the market.","The other part of the market, the high-end continues to roll as it always had. So what we've seen come through, both our dealer channel and our in-stock and vanities business, is real strength there.","And we've been running hard to catch up, but we continue to have strong demand there. And so we're investing more. Some of that's in our Mexican operations because that's where some of that product comes out of. Some of it comes out of our USDA network. And then some of it comes out of our more stock platform or stock-type platforms. And so we on the one hand see strong demand in that part of market.","In the middle of the market, so it's kind of like in the tweeners, that's where it's kind of been flexing a little bit strong, little bit off, little bit strong, little bit off, for kind of the last four or five quarters. And so we've kind of said, all right, there is a core of that business which looks good. We are going to build around that core, and then we'll take a little bit of capacity out of that part of the market, bring it into our most efficient operations. So we'll get leverage around what we can predict.","So we're a realist, we're clear eyed. We're just saying, we can see sitting on top of a quarter of this Cabinet market, what's working. And we're going to drive harder there. And it's going to be inside of the channels that we're in, so we're \u2013 50% of our revenue comes through dealer. Got a quarter of our business coming through that in-stock and vanity business through the two big home centers. So, we're going to focus hard on that.","And then the other parts of the market, we like other parts of the market. We're just going to dial in on what's working and then pull some capacity back out again so we can get some leverage there. And I think that sets us up, the reason I'm talking about it sets us up nicely for next couple of years is because we're playing through those trends that are already existing in the market, and we're leveraging the positions that we're in. We are not having to run out and go get stuff.","We are just playing harder in those parts of the market that are working and then there are slices that we are just saying, all right, we're going to rationalize some capacity around it and we still have flexibility inside the facilities that we maintain and we can flex up shifts so we can do some other stuff, so if that part of the market comes back a little bit stronger, we've still got that flexibility and we'll just closely monitor it.","So I think the great thing about being of the scale that we are in Cabinets is that we can uniquely see across the whole market, and we can say, all right, this is where we want to go. And others can make their bets and do their own thing, and that's great. But we know what we know how to do and we know how to execute, and we have a great plan and a great team, and they're running hard against it. And as I said, I feel better today because we've got a tight plan and they are driving it hard. And so I feel good about where that business is going to go because we can control what we can control.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that makes sense. And then the second question, I think I may have missed this. But I thought I heard you say that there is some walk-away business in one of the home centers. I was just curious what \u2013 was that in Cabinets and maybe if you could quantify that?","Christopher J. Klein - Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.","Let me quantify this, it's sort of third home center. So I just \u2013 I don't like talking about our customers by name, but there's two big ones and then there's a third smaller one. And so there's Cabinet business there that we exited at the beginning of the year and so that business was in decline for us and so it didn't make sense for us to continue with that. And in turn, we're heavily focused on the two large home centers and their special order business and are excited about what they're doing.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you very much guys.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fortune Brands Home & Security Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Brian Lantz, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brian Lantz","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Fortune Brands Home & Security quarterly investor conference call and webcast.

Following our prepared remarks, we've allowed ample time to address any questions that you may have. I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Klein","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We had a very good second quarter with strong growth that met our plans for sales and exceeded our plans for profits. We continue to drive profitable growth in a market which, as expected, continues to recover at an uneven pace.","Let me first spend some time on the second quarter highlights, and then I'll discuss our current thoughts on the full year. First, with regard to the market, both the overall home products market and the market for our products again grew mid-single digits in the quarter, in line with our assumptions. New construction was a bit stronger than expected in both single-family and multifamily starts. And the pace of Repair & Remodel spending slowed somewhat from the previous quarter due in part to continued consumer caution for big-ticket purchases like cabinets.","Importantly, we continue to feel confident about our performance in this market and the execution of our strategies as we entered into the second half of 2012.","Turning to our performance for the quarter, sales were up 5% from a year ago and up 8% excluding Cabinets as cabinet sales were negatively impacted by our disciplined response to high levels of competitor promotions in home centers. Moen continued its strong performance with sales growth of 12%, and also surpassed our sales and profit plans. Windows & Door sales were up 7% and the segment was profitable. Security & Storage grew 2%, surpassing our sales and profit plans, and within the segment, Security sales were up 7%. Cabinet sales grew around 1%, a bit below our estimates of the cabinet market growth in the quarter, which continued to lag the overall U.S. home products market in the second quarter. Importantly, our profits from Cabinets were up 22% in the quarter. And second quarter profits have already matched our full year 2011 profits for Cabinets.","Now let me give you some top line highlights by segment. Plumbing sales were up 12% in the second quarter. Moen again saw gains in both the U.S. and in our international businesses, particularly China. Gains were strong at the U.S. wholesale business where we saw continued volume gains, driven largely by the pace of new construction. Our efforts over the past few years to build on leading market share with the top builders and wholesalers, expand the multifamily segment and upgrade many of our showroom displays again yielded strong results in the quarter. Moen also continues to see strength from our steady pace of consumer-driven practical innovations. Spot-resistant finishes are rolling out more and more sales and are now available in the wholesale channel. Our successful Reflex technology for pull-down faucets will soon be launched in pull-out versions, which provide exceptional reach and range of motion with dependable retraction. And Moen's latest innovation, MotionSense, a new hands-free, touchless kitchen faucet will begin shipping in the second half of the year.","Internationally, sales in China, where there are now over 600 Moen branded stores, were again up double digits over the prior year, driven by new construction growth and our continued expansion into tier 3 and tier 4 markets. The team in China continues to expand our brand with wider range of price points and products. In Security & Storage, our sales were up 2% in the second quarter. Security again saw broad gains, up 7%, driven by innovative new products and broader placement in retail ahead of the back-to-school season, continued to outgrow within global safety solutions and strong international sales of padlocks.","The Master Lock brand is strong and our innovation continues to hit the mark with products like our new electronic combination lock, Speed Dial. Our storage products were down in the quarter as promotional activity has shifted sales from the second quarter into the first quarter. Notably, for the first 6 months, storage products were up double digits to the prior year.","Windows & Door sales were up 7% for the quarter. Door products, which are heavily driven by new construction, saw high single-digit sales gains. We saw incremental sales from a recently launched relationship with a major window and door company and growth at our wholesale distributors. Windows products were up mid-single digits, driven by a better market and some share gains from new products and growth in targeted channels. Sales for our Cabinets business were up about 1% for the quarter and met our expectations. We continue to perform well as the market leader in cabinets. As the pace of new construction picked up, we saw a particular strength with dealers and builders in our new construction lines. In the dealer channel, where we're the clear market leader, we continue to grow by leveraging our portfolio of brands, some new door style additions and our strong product and service reputation. In home centers, we saw some volume share losses because of our disciplined approach to promotional spending. While we did not increase our promotional spending relative to prior year levels, our competitors intensified their promotional activity. It's important to note that even though promotions can divert volume on a month-to-month basis, they have not resulted in a change in shelf space or program placement from us in home centers. We continue to focus on more sustainable long-term growth opportunities such as our recently introduced value price point door styles for the Thomasville line at The Home Depot and select enhancements to our vanities line at Lowe's. We expect these innovations and our enhanced designer services to help us outperform the cabinets markets in the second half of the year. Importantly, we grew our cabinet profits 22% in the quarter, which exceeded our plans and reflects our ability to successfully target growth in channels, markets and product segments that are not as promotionally driven. In the quarter, we once again demonstrated our ability to generate and grow profits in a business where some of our competitors still struggle to even breakeven. We believe that our market leadership, combined with our world-class operating platform and service levels, gives us the strategic flexibility to drive profitable growth to date and into the future as the cabinet market slowly recovers.","So throughout the second quarter, the market continued to firm led by significantly stronger new construction in a Repair & Remodel market that while growing, remains uneven. I'm very pleased with our performance across the portfolio for the quarter and the entire first half. We continue to execute our strategies as we innovate to invest, to capture profitable growth opportunities and leverage our market-leading positions.","Let me now turn to our current top line outlook for 2012, starting with our assumptions for our market. We will then take you through our specific full year outlook in a few moments. From a market perspective, we're seeing continued signs of improvement relative to a year ago and a firming of the overall market as we enter the second half. While challenges in the housing market remains, such as tight credit, foreclosures and some soft home prices in some parts of the country, new construction improved in the second quarter, particularly in single-family starts. Repair & Remodel continued to grow, albeit at a slightly slower pace than we would have thought as we enter the second quarter. As expected, concerns about the general health of the economy and the pace of the recovery are still weighing on consumers' confidence and their willingness to embrace larger ticket purchases like cabinets. Our updated full year plans remain built on an assumption that the total market for our home products grows at a mid-single-digit rate. Within that assumption, we now expect the Repair & Remodel growth rate of around 3% to 4%, and a new construction growth rate of about 20%. Given our exposure to the slower growth cabinets market, our plans assume that the market for our products grows a bit slower than the overall market but still within the mid-single digits range. So based on that market assumption, which includes stronger new construction and a little softer Repair & Remodel, we continue to expect our 2012 full year sales to increase at a high single-digit pace over 2011, although toward the lower end of that range. We believe our innovation and our execution are key competitive advantages that will help us to continue to outperform the strengthening market for our products.","Importantly, we're reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance in the range of $0.77 to $0.87 for the full year. So to sum up, driven by new construction, the overall market remains firm with strong first half results and we're confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance. We continue to execute our strategies and remain focused on outperforming the market. We strive to create value by capturing market share, expanding into adjacent markets and improving our operating platforms. We believe our strong brands, management teams and capital structure provide key flexibility to focus on profitable growth and should therefore position us to create value at any pace of recovery. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will review our financial performance and provide more details on our full year outlook.","E. Lee Wyatt","Thanks, Chris. As Brian mentioned, the majority of my comments will focus on income before charges and gains, which best reflects ongoing business performance. Let me start with our second quarter results. Sales were $935 million, up 5% from a year ago. Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $73 million, up $11 million or 18% compared to the same quarter last year.","EPS were $0.29 for the second quarter, up $0.05 or 21% versus the same quarter last year.","Now let me provide color on segment results. Plumbing sales for the second quarter were $282 million, up $30 million or 12% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income was $43 million, up $8 million or 24%. Both the U.S. wholesale and China businesses experienced strong double-digit sales growth that drove the overall growth in both segment sales and operating profit. Second quarter Security & Storage sales were $148 million, up $4 million or 2% versus the prior year quarter. Operating income was $21 million, up $2 million or 8%. Security sales increased $7 million or 7% on the strength of retail and international padlocks and global safety, plus Storage sales declined $3 million or 7% due to the shift in the retail and promotional spend in the first quarter and out of the second quarter.","Windows & Door sales were $160 million, up $11 million or 7% from the prior year quarter. Operating income for this segment was $4 million, $1 million less than last year due to timing of expenses and some channel mix. We continue to expect our Windows & Doors business to be profitable for the full year and meaningfully ahead of 2011.","Our Cabinets sales were $346 million, up $2 million or around 1% over the prior year quarter. Operating income for the segment was $18 million versus $15 million in the prior year, up 22%. While our disciplined approach to promotional spending limited our growth in the home center channel, second quarter profit of $18 million grew 22% and equaled full year 2011 segment profit. Our strategy is working as planned, and we believe that we will exceed the overall cabinet market growth in the second half by introducing new products and expanding existing programs. We expect our Cabinet business to be profitable for the full year and significantly ahead of the $18 million earned in 2011.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our June 30 balance sheet ended with cash of $147 million, debt of $361 million, and net debt to EBITDA leverage is now less than 1, at around 0.7x. We have nothing drawn on our $650 million revolver facility and are entering the second half of the year where we traditionally generate most of our annual free cash flow. Free cash flow was $81 million year-to-date including $55 million from option proceeds. Our outstanding shares have grown by 5 million shares from option exercises since the spinoff. The resulting EPS dilution, combined with accumulating cash, has led our board to approve a modest share repurchase authorization of $150 million over a 3-year period. Given our expectation for growth and free cash flow, as well as the projected positive return from repurchasing shares at this time, we believe that this is an appropriate use of cash to create incremental shareholder value. Longer term, we expect to have a balanced approach to cash utilization to drive shareholder value, which includes additional organic growth investments, selective acquisitions and some combination of share repurchases and the initiation of a dividend.","Let me now provide my thoughts in further detail on the outlook for 2012. As we have said, our approach to planning and providing the annual outlook has 3 elements: our market assumption, continued share gains and business investments. First, with the continued firming we saw through the second quarter, our market assumptions remained close to published market consensus. As Chris mentioned, new construction is trending stronger. However, Repair & Remodel, while growing, continues to be uneven. So we continue to project the market for our products to lag the overall market in the early stage of a potential recovery due to our mix of higher ticket items such as cabinets. Second, our plan still includes continued share gains in addition to overall market growth. And third, we plan to make investments across the business which should provide returns in 2012 and beyond. While we're pleased with our 2012 performance, we expect significant growth in the out years and want to invest ahead of the opportunity. Therefore, we continue to expect to make approximately $20 million of incremental investments during 2012. We've already made about 50% of that amount in the first half.","So turning to our outlook details. As Chris mentioned for the full year, our planning assumption remains that the market for our product will be up mid-single digits with the mix shifting a little towards new construction. Based on this market assumption and continued share gains, we continue to expect our 2012 sales to increase high-single digits compared to 2011, with all segments increasing. However, the sales increase will likely be somewhat lower in that range due to the slower growth in Repair & Remodel and our disciplined approach to promotional spending in Cabinets. Based on our marketing sales growth assumption, our expectations for 2012 EPS before charges and gains is unchanged with a range of $0.77 to $0.87. Again, the midpoint of this range is $0.82 and represents an increase of 37% over 2011 EPS of $0.60.","We expect 2012 free cash flow to be in the range of $225 million to $250 million after CapEx of approximately $80 million, pension contributions of $20 million and over $70 million in proceeds from option exercises.","In summary, our business model continues to perform well, and we're pleased with our second quarter and first half results. We've maintained our outlook for the full year despite uneven growth in the Repair & Remodel market. While the pace and steadiness of market growth is not certain, our first half performance indicates that we should be well positioned to continue to outperform the market at any pace of recovery by leveraging our foundation of leading brands, efficient supply chains, proven management team and strong capital structure. I will now turn the call back to Brian.","Brian Lantz","Thanks, Lee. That concludes our prepared remarks for the second quarter. We'll now begin taking your questions and we'll continue as time allows. Since there may be a number of you that would like to ask a question, I'll ask that you limit your initial questions to 2 and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions. I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Gentlemen, your first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Just the first question, I guess, with the share repurchase authorization, if you're going to generate $225 million, $250 million of cash this year and you're already under-levered, why not put an authorization that's larger or longer in duration just to send a message that if other opportunities don't come along, you have that flexibility to repurchase stock?","Christopher J. Klein","I'd say I'd do this as a good first step. So with the dilution coming in on the shares from option exchanges and the cash starting to accumulate, I think $150 million was a prudent first step. That doesn't preclude us down the road from initiating a dividend or initiating a larger share repurchase or frankly, it gives us firepower for acquisitions as well. So I think it was a prudent action to take at this time and that's kind of how we viewed it. It doesn't preclude anything else down the road.","Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, separately in the Cabinets business, can you be a little bit more specific on the promotions, whether maybe some case through the quarter, designs to accelerate or decelerate? And then as well into July, any change in habit? And I guess just big picture, what do you think changes the dynamic where the incremental sale has to be driven by promotions?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, it's very much a home center phenomena right now. And I think yet through the quarter, it's probably most intense mid-quarter, kind of not as bad at the beginning, not as bad at the end. So I kind of look at that through July. I think what abates that is the capacity is going to start getting chewed up by new construction volume, which I think our competitors and ourselves are responding to. For us, we're so strong in the dealer channel that we've got a lot of volume flowing through there. So I think at some point, that kind of balances it out and it should calm down a bit. We've been pretty restrained, and to be candid, I think we've done pretty well being restrained. And we've kind of been content to let the others duke it out at the home center level, kind of in the extreme sides of that. That's not to say we're not active in the promotion side, we are. But we're not jumping into that extreme end of the pond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My question is on Security & Storage. You talked about the changes of promotional calendar in the first quarter affecting second quarter. As we get into the second half of the year, year-over-year, are there any promotional changes or should we start seeing more consistent results?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, my guess is second half of the year is going to line up a bit more like traditionally it did. It was pretty unique that our largest customer there promoted heavily in the first quarter. We haven't seen that before. If we look at the whole first half, we're up low single-digits for that business. So it's really pretty strong. First half performance is just that they surged in the first quarter and then we paid for a little bit in the second quarter. So I expect it's going to be more similar to traditionally what we've seen here in the second half.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And second question on Windows & Doors, can you speak to the profitability trend for window versus door?","Christopher J. Klein","Window versus door?","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, we break it out separately, but I'll just give you kind of directionally. I think in doors with a strong quarter, really driven by new construction, and that drove some pretty good results. On the window side, we're doing better. Last year, it was pretty rough. It was good kind of the first 6 months following the energy tax credit. So this year, we're doing better, but I'm still watching that market on the window side. I've said before that we're looking for some capacity to come out of that market, some rationalization, if you will. So that's kind of the balance of that group right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess my first question is kind of following up on the Windows & Doors. This might be just taking a step back, but they are very different businesses in terms of the current industry structure. On the doors, you take an OEM business. The largest window door company just acquired a door company. To the extent you're expecting capacity, how does that impact kind of the margin prospects? What is it directionally now versus kind of a peak, and if they're still kind of the same. And on the windows, is it more vertical or is it people maybe just doing the extrusion that you expect the capacity to come out?","Christopher J. Klein","I'll start with the window side. I think it's downstream [ph] . I don't think it's necessarily on the extrusion side and that market's actually okay. It's really downstream on the assembly side. And I think there are some companies out there that were supported by that '09 and '10 surge in demand from the energy tax credit and they're not going to be long term. It's just taking a while to work that through the system. On the door side, where we sit is really at the high end in fiberglass, wood grain fiberglass, and we sell the whole door system. And so we're really in the most enviable position in that industry. There's a lot of guys kind of down the quality stream and as you move into steel, pretty commodity-like building material. So our products are differentiated there and our margin structure reflects it. We do get a premium there. We keep innovating, we keep bringing in new styles, finishes, glass tiles [ph] . We're making our own glass. We're the only guy in the industry who does that, so we get a lot of design flexibility. So yes, I think we've got a pretty strong set of barriers around that business. As long as we just keep innovating, keep extending distribution, which is what we've done, we've got a pretty good business there. That responds [indiscernible] I was just going to say, that responds well to new construction, too. As we see the new construction volumes come, that business levers very well on new construction.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. And then on the Cabinets side, I know you're more dealer-oriented, yet I still think the -- your results probably are somewhat shackled to other industry players that are company decisions. Can you potentially discuss some profit differential that you have in channels where there's less discounting versus [indiscernible]  dealer or wholesaler versus the big box to the extent you feel comfortable?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, we don't really break it up by channel, but I would just say I think across channels, we're really trying to get disciplined in terms of what is good business. There is still a very good business in the home centers, and we're still working very hard with our partners in the home centers and delivering some excellent product there, excellent programs there. But all we're doing is not chasing that last bit, which is so very heavily promoted that it's just drawing the profitability in that slice of the market. So I'd say there's still a lot of very strong and profitable Cabinet business in the home centers. The dealer business just has less of that extreme promotional piece. And so that's why for right now, it's a bit more stable as a channel, and the new construction is coming to us directly from builder direct, as well as through our dealer channel. And so that looks pretty good. So that's about all I can say in terms of breakout on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pollard with Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick one on your guidance. Your sales forecast, you brought it down, but you're reiterating EPS. What line items went up such that your EPS didn't change? And also, can you talk about whether the 30%, 31% tax rate is what we should expect the rest of the year?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes, I would tell you, start with the tax rate. First, both first 2 quarters were around 31%. I think it'll be a little higher in the back half, and I'd say for a full year, you might think about 34-ish. We historically said 35%, I think it could be 34-ish to 35% this year. And I think the other thing in terms of the guidance, we're still in that high single-digit range. We've just cautioned that it could be a little lower because we're not chasing some of that low-margin business that Chris just talked about, especially in Cabinets. So I think where the sales are a little softer still on that high single-digits, that doesn't really impact profit that much. And mix overall is actually getting a little better.","Christopher J. Klein","But another way we could chase some revenue and hit those numbers, but it wouldn't really impact profit.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's impressive. Let me ask one more question, and I'm sorry to beat the Cabinets horse till it's dead, but I'm trying to understand the drivers of your incremental margins in Cabinet. They were very, very large with the sales not quite making it, but you guys actually beating my forecast on margins. I'm trying to understand while you guys are promoting the same level as last year, what's really driving your margins up?","Christopher J. Klein","Well, it's a little bit of mix coming through, so I'd say there's a little leverage there. There's some -- a little bit of cost savings leverage coming through the business as well, some kind of continuous improvement cost savings type initiatives. There's some new product coming through there. So I'd say it's a combination of those things coming through. And I think we're just being a bit more disciplined in the kind of business that's coming our way. I think in general, the market, while soft in R&R, is a bit stronger on new constructions so there is a little bit of mix to the positive on that, too.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just sneak one last one in. Share repurchases, I was just under the impression that, that was much lower on your list of cash usage. So I'm a little bit surprised by the announcement. Is the deal flow just really not there for you guys or has the market actually slowed you guys down from really looking at some of the organic opportunities?","Christopher J. Klein","No, I don't think anything's off the table. I think, frankly, cash flow is so strong that we've got an excess of cash flow. We've said from the start, from the day of our spend that we're going to be efficient with cash flow. We've got a very good operating platform across our businesses so we don't need to have kind of this cash safety net. So we can be very efficient and we intend to be very efficient. I think as we consider the use of cash, the deal flow right now is still kind of slow in terms of companies for sale. So as we would expect that'll pick up in 12 to 24 months, we just keep playing at capacity to do the things that are strategic, and so that's still on the table. And the dividend's still on the table. I think we're just -- we'll wait to see the market firm up a little bit. And as we initiate that, that would -- we certainly want that to be sustained and increasing over a period of time. So nothing's off the table, I just think we're being efficient with cash. And this isn't a big share repurchase, but I think it's prudent for the time and shows that we're kind of living to what we say. And I'd expect everything else is still out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.","Unknown Analyst","This is actually Will [ph] on for Dan. I was wondering if you could try to isolate what the mix impact was on margins versus the investments. And what will be driving the better leverage in the second half for Windows & Doors?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. In terms of the investment, we spent about $4 million in the second quarter. We spent about $5 million, so we're kind of halfway there. So you look at our overall leverage for the company, we were 25% on incremental sales in the second quarter. If you back out $4 million, we're over 30%. So that's kind of normal leverage for us. That's what we expect on incremental sales. So no real surprises there.","Unknown Analyst","And then as a follow-up, I'm wondering if you could talk about price commodity relationships across the business?","E. Lee Wyatt","Yes. We saw some commodities moving up in the first month or 2 of the year. But now, they've kind of come down and on a year-to-date basis, is relatively flat. You'll see a couple down 1 or 2 points, but generally flat, things like hardwood and glass. But on the other side, labor cost out of China has not come down and it actually is ticking up. So that's yielding into a little bit of those commodities savings. So generally, we thought we'd have a tailwind coming into this year of about $14 million, $15 million net of price, and we're kind of in that same range. So it's moving around a little bit, but it's kind of where we thought.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to touch on SG&A. SG&A was up around 10% year-over-year and revenues grew 5%. And I was hoping I could just get a little bit better understanding what's driving the increase in SG&A and how we should be thinking of that in the back half of the year.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, the SG&A was driven by a couple of things. We had the $4 million of investments, of course, that we just talked about. And it's just truing up with some higher volumes. We're doing some catch-up on accruals in the quarter. So it's a little bit higher, a little bit of incentive increase there. So nothing significant. We're historically around 26% SG&A as a percent of sales. So we're going to be, I think, full year, in that same range, 25% to 26%.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the $4 million is just kind of nonrecurring, and we can just assume that goes away at some point?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, generally, it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess for the first question, the volatility in Remodel. Can you give us a sense as to kind of how those trends played out there in the quarter? And I'd be really interested if you have any data points or anecdotes about repair versus discretionary and kind of how the trends there would be shaking out?","Christopher J. Klein","Sure. I think the quarter is a little weaker than the first quarter. People talk about weather, maybe that had something to do with it. But I think in general, it was a little weaker and then stabilized. So I didn't see it getting worse, which I think was good news. Discretionary certainly was a lot weaker, so that would be the Cabinets category. I think consumers are just being very cautious on big ticket. On our smaller ticket purchases, we didn't see as much so for us, it's looking pretty good as you can see in the numbers, so -- and I think that held up a little bit better. So I think it is just maybe a little bit more deflated consumer confidence rolling through the market right now on the discretionary side of the market. So it's holding in there. I look at it by -- over the last 3, 4 years, we're certainly on a positive trend. It just looked as if it might be a little bit more positive the start of the year than perhaps we're sitting right now, but it's still tracking positive.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, perfect. That's good color. And then if I could switch gears over to Plumbing, it looks like China, good growth story continues there. How much of that can you maybe ascribe to just more feet on the street, more of a presence there for you versus strong consumer demand there given a lot of concerns with what might be happening over there? Just trying to get a little color on that.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, I saw a little of both. I think it's fair to say that their market is slowing down a little bit. It isn't as bad as what I think you'd read that Chinese market, real estate market is on the downside. I think we're still seeing growth there. So I think there's definitely market growth, but it's cooled off a bit. Yes, and then in terms of our expansion, we continue to grow there. So the second -- I'm sorry, third, fourth tier markets continuing to open up storefronts feet on the street is definitely helping us. It's a big country so it's -- in terms of -- we're not quite there in terms of saturation, we've got plenty to go. And we're pleased with our results and our momentum there, but we're being appropriately cautious. We don't want to get too far out ahead especially if it does cool off even more. But I think we're at about the right pace for where that market's growing right now and our results are pretty strong.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Justin Maurer with Lord, Abbett.","Justin C. Maurer - Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC","Can -- I don't know if -- back to Pete's question about kind of Repair & Remodel versus new construction, are you guys at all -- is it surprising to you that the strength in -- so new construction is better than you thought. But you would think, if anything, that should be pulling up the repair and the remodel in the sense that presumably, most of the people that are -- the written orders for the new homes, those will largely move up people, I suspect, rather than new home buyers just from an inability to get credit. So you would think that those folks, if there's housing turnover, that, that should result in some R&R spend but might not have otherwise been the case. I guess I'm a little bit puzzled by the divergence. And I guess if it's just simply cabinets, I can kind of understand that, if somebody decided not to do a kitchen or something. But I don't know if you can make any sense of that.","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, it's most pronounced in cabinets, you're right. I think it is positive, so that's good. I mean I'm kind of -- like I'm happy it's positive relative to the last 3 to 5 years, so that's a good thing. I think we're calling the full year on R&R some place between 3% and 4%, which isn't where it should be in a full recovery. It should be 5% plus, north of 5% in full recovery. So it's a little softer than that. I think that is just discretionary. I think for those that are kind of required projects, people are doing them but I just see them being a little bit more cautious. It's also interesting to see the first quarter was stronger  second quarter. Weather might have something to do with it, but I think it was more optimism in the market. So when optimism comes back in again and consumers don't feel like they've got to be as protective of their household assets, they are freeing up money. And that's a good thing. So I think where they need to be cautious in the short term, longer term, I think it does bode well for us. So I'm not overly concerned. In terms of new construction, I think it just reflects the overall marketplace. If you look at the builders, they are building in some markets and the overall numbers are up strong, and we're so strong in some of those segments, especially Moen and Therma-Tru in some segments of the cabinet market that, that's just flowing so strongly through our business.","Justin C. Maurer - Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC","Yes. I guess, again, I just -- with seeing all the builders put up 30%, 40% order growth that you would suspect if 6 months ago, you would have said, posed that question, you would have thought that, that certainly would've meant good things for Repair & Remodel. Not necessarily that they have to be 100% correlation, correlated at least directionally and...","Christopher J. Klein","I think they will be eventually. That's my own forecast, and Lord knows enough smart people out there forecasting and -- but my own view would be eventually, that is exactly what will happen, that those 2 will correlate much tighter. I think right now, it's just a pause as you'd see a pause in the general economy, unemployment number still running a little bit high and people just kind of saying maybe a time to pause. That's what it feels like in the business. That's what it feels like when we're out talking to people, when we're in the dealers, when we're in the home centers talking and saying kind of \"why is it a little softer?\" That's the sense we get. It's just more of a pause than it is more of a fundamental issue like we would have seen back in 2008, 2009.","Operator","Gentlemen, your final question comes from the line of Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, you talked about plenty of capacity. I was hoping maybe you all could run through your 4 units and just talk about what type of operational leverage. In other words, what percentage is fixed cost versus variable cost on that?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes. We basically look at our portfolio of segments, they break into 2 simple kind of pieces. We've got 2 variable cost segments. That would be the Moen and the Security & Storage. Those are the guys that have that consistently high operating margins in the mid-teens and they're variable cost. So they move their -- they've got normalized [ph]  supply chains where they basically source a lot of componentry. And the other 2 pieces, Windows & Doors and Cabinets, are much more fixed cost, much lower margin today. When we don't have as much volume, those will level -- leverage nicely in a recovery. So it's very different now. Throughout our total company, I think we said \"where are we from a capacity standpoint?\" We're probably below 60% utilization right now, probably somewhere 55% to 60%. So a lot of capacity to move up. We've always talked about being able to get that to high teen [ph] in revenue with the footprint generally that we have as long as the volume comes back in kind of a reasonable regional basis. So we feel pretty good about capacity.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked a lot about what your investment this year is, and could you just be a little bit more specific about primarily, could you rank orders sort of where the dollars are going? Are we talking in-store promos, primarily advertisement, co-ops? What are you trying to really focus on?","Christopher J. Klein","Yes, we basically -- the $20 million we've talked about is basically spread pretty evenly throughout the business. And there's no huge pieces, but examples would be, for example, some Moen brand spend as we get back into this -- as they continue to drive their business, a little investment in China. You've got some investments in systems, especially web-based systems. They're just kind of across this systemwide here. We try to get better there. Doing some infrastructure investment in security and safety, electronics, a little bit of international. So there's nothing huge, nothing that's a really big bet, but it's just trying to get each of the businesses well prepared as we come back to this recovery over the next several years.","Operator","Gentlemen, I turn the call back over to you.","Brian Lantz","Great. We'd like to thank everyone for attending our quarterly call today, and look forward to speaking with all of you again very soon. Thank you very much.","Operator","Today's call was recorded.
