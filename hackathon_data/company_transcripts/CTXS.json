My name is Ian, and I will be your Web event specialist today. During the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. You can ask questions at any time during the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Eduardo Fleites. Eduardo, the floor is yours.","Eduardo Fleites - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Ian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's first quarter 2017 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be Kirill Tatarinov, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Henshall, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems' Investor Relations website. The webcast replay will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Securities Law. These statements are based on current expectation and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the company's filings with the SEC.","Copies are available from the SEC or on the company's Investor Relations website. Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I'd like to turn it over the David Henshall, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO. David?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We continue to show good results and execution from the operational initiatives driving leverage to the strength in product portfolio that's fueling growth and increased win rates. We're focused on our core strategy of securely delivering apps and data both on-premises and in the cloud, setting the company up for success in 2017 and over the long term.","As a note, throughout the call today, we'll only be discussing results from continuing operations, excluding the one-month impact from the former GoTo products.","As you can see from the release, Q1 results were as forecasted. Revenue was up 1%, adjusted op margin was 28% and adjusted EPS was $0.97 a share. However, the mix of sales in the period saw a large increase in subscription-based items like CSP, annual term license and Citrix Cloud sales. This contributed to billings growth of over 5% year-on-year as well as total deferred revenue, which was up 11%. I'll talk more about these trends here in a couple minutes.","In Q1, we closed 47 $1 million-plus transactions, with strength in technology, fin services and health care. There's good balance across the portfolio with approximately two-thirds of these deals coming from the Workspace Services area including the full suite and the balance from networking and cloud.","So next, let's look at the Q1 results within our primary product areas. Workspace Services, which includes virtualization and mobility, was flat year-on-year at $400 million. As we've discussed before, there are several specific initiatives we're driving to accelerate growth in this area including faster innovation, integration of our unique assets, greater competitive positioning and the reinvigoration of our channel partnerships, especially with Microsoft. These efforts have steadily increased our win rate and competitive opportunities.","There are, however, a few dynamics that are worth noting from Q1. First, the sales mix in this business is where we're seeing the most pronounced shift to subscription-based offerings. In total, the contribution from contracts of this type was over 20% of product license sales, up from just 11% a year ago.","Next, on a recognized basis, license revenue growth in the Americas was up over 5% in the quarter, continuing the above-market growth seen in this region over many, many quarters, and we're also seeing good traction from our APJ restructuring, where Workspace Services license was up 9% in Q1.","Third, we had strong growth in monthly CSP subscriptions, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Total recognized revenue in this area grew 36% and now has an annualized run rate of $90 million.","And finally, we've had a really good response from the newly launched Customer Success Services, the redefined software maintenance program that we announced at the beginning of last quarter \u2013 really helping to drive growth in deferred revenue as well.","Turning to the Networking business, total revenue decreased 1% year-on-year in the quarter to $193 million with license revenue down 9% year-on-year. This result is in line with our forecast as we expected a decline in the Cloud Infrastructure segment due to the difficult comps from a year ago. I will remind everybody that the NetScaler business is essentially made up of two main segments: cloud infrastructure and e-com, also known as our SSP business; and enterprise ADC, which includes solutions sales made alongside the Xen family products.","Within the quarter, SSP license sales were down about 20% year-on-year but up nearly 100% sequentially from Q4. We continue to expect growth rates to increase in the second half of the year due to easier comps as well as our focus on expanding the base of customers.","In the enterprise ADC segment, license increased nicely in Q1 due to the capacity in management investments we made in the second half of last year. All in, we sold to about 1,900 networking customers in the period with 30% of them being new, which reflects our strong competitive position as well as providing expansion opportunities in the future.","And finally, our total SaaS revenue was up 24% to $39 million in the quarter. The largest component of this is ShareFile, our secure data platform, with the new Citrix Cloud services now addressing Workspace-as-a-Service and the networking needs of our customers.","As I mentioned earlier a couple times, we are seeing an increased shift in the way that our products are being delivered, evolving towards a more subscription-based model where unit growth, sales and cash flow are going to exceed revenue in the short term. When we account for all of the ratable product subscription items, including revenue that's coming from CSPs, our cloud-based services and annual term license, the aggregate ARR was over $275 million in Q1, which is up 22% from last year. We do expect this trend to continue throughout the year as more of our portfolio is available as a service in Citrix Cloud.","Given the increased pace of this transformation, right now we're planning to provide more insight into the longer-term economic model as well as our plan for the revenue model at our Analyst Meeting at the end of May.","So turning to operations, we've driven a lot of efficiencies in the company over the past couple of years. The actions across the business were designed to generate permanent expense reductions while reallocating investment to those areas that will drive profitable growth in the future. In Q1, adjusted op margin 28%. It was down a couple points from last year but in line with our plan for 2017. The difference from last year represents those capacity investments in sales and services to drive enterprise networking, tech support investments to support this upgrade to Customer Success Services, and in professional services to assist customers with cloud and security projects. We're still comfortable with our full-year target of 32% to 33% even as more revenue is being recognized ratably.","Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue increased to $1.66 billion, up 11% from last year due to the strength of Customer Success Services and these subscription-based sales that I've been talking about.","Exiting Q1, we had nearly $2.4 billion in cash and investments, aided by cash flow from ops of $292 million from continuing operations in Q1. In total, cash was down from the end of Q4 as we restarted and accelerated our share repurchase program. In the quarter, we purchased over 7 million shares for a total of $550 million, which leaves about $400 million in our additional authorization. So our growth strategy in operational programs have been working. We're pleased with the results and confident in our plans as we consider this coming year.","Before I discuss our guidance moving forward, I'd like to provide a little color around our plan. Overall, our view of the Workspace Services opportunity continues to strengthen, and we expect cloud adoption and the mix of subscription-based sales to begin to accelerate as we move through the year. In networking, we remain our conservative view due to the cyclical nature of the NetScaler SSP segment, which we continue to expect is going to return to growth in the second half of the year. And on margins, we'll manage OpEx to drive leverage in the areas that we've outlined previously.","So for the full year 2017, we are leaving our guidance unchanged and continue to expect revenue between $2.81 billion and $2.84 billion, which is an increase of 3% to 4% over last year, and adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.65 per share. For Q2, with an increasing mix of ratable sales, we expect revenue between $685 million and $695 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.97 to $1. We're proud of the continued improvement in results, our new product innovations and the early returns from Citrix Cloud. We're also continuing to make those go-to-market capacity investments that should drive additional growth as we move through this year.","So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward. Kirill?","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, David. Hello and welcome, everyone. This was indeed a significant quarter in our transformation, so let me add a few qualitative highlights. Our global field teams exceeded their bookings plans in all geos. The new leadership in both APJ and EMEA demonstrating much improved execution, growing bookings in the double digits. And as in previous quarters, the Americas team continued growth momentum in the first quarter.","For the first time in more than four years, our Workspace Services product bookings grew double digits. One could say that we have turned the tide here. We've added over 1 million new users, which is about 50% faster user base growth year-on-year, with mix strongly shifting towards subscription as David mentioned.","139 customers chose Citrix Cloud in Q1 to run their workspaces, with most of them being existing Citrix customers transitioning to the cloud, with several of them were seven-figure cloud deals. Both CSP and ShareFile did very well, adding to the overall subscription ARR which exceeded $275 million, as David mentioned. In addition, our innovation and increased competitive positioning are paying off with over 1,000 competitive wins in Workspace Services and Networking in Q1, with overall win rates continues to accelerate. Our momentum is building, making it clear that our strategy and execution are focused in the right direction.","Now let me add a few extra comments on our solution areas. We've continued with an accelerated quarterly update cadence for our core XenApp, XenDesktop products, delivering the 7.13 release in Q1. We've also fully integrated recently acquired Unidesk technology into our solutions set, adding to the overall momentum.","Among many Q1 wins against the competition, two major global financial institutions chose Citrix for application delivery driven primarily by our unique capability with Skype for Business.","As we moved into 2017, we set the priority for our sellers and partners to lead with Citrix Workspace Suite, and this quarter we're already seeing results. Among many large wins, Saab chose CWS to enable the company's digital transformation and desktop delivery. Our unified product organization is now much more focused on integrated innovation, making CWS even more appealing in the future.","Moving on to networking products. We've continued to innovate rapidly here, stressing our unique pure software-defined and application-first approaches. In Q1, we introduced NetScaler SD-WAN as a service in Azure with Zero Touch Deployment, and we released NetScaler Gateway through Microsoft EMS, and also NetScaler SD-WAN 9.2 with improved scalability and throughput. This rapid innovation makes us very enthusiastic about our future prospects with NetScaler, particularly in SD-WAN where our years of experience in application-aware networking and scalability make a huge difference and paying off already. For example, a major European home furnishings company chose SD-WAN for branch reliability, driven by the performance and app-aware capabilities of our solution.","While David mentioned NetScaler SSP results remained muted in Q1 due to the cyclical nature of this business, we saw growth for NetScaler ADC in the enterprise. For example, a major Asian electronics company and a major North American insurance company both chose NetScaler ADC for the reliability and security that it offers. We also saw many switching opportunities with NetScaler, driven by a combination of scalability, performance and security that only Citrix can offer. For example, the Nemours Foundation chose NetScaler to replace a competitor to support their needs for hosting the number one most visited children's health website in the world, KidsHealth.org. Very exciting undertaking by the Citrix team.","On to the secure data delivery. ShareFile had a very strong quarter in the enterprise, demonstrating the proven value that ShareFile brings to companies of all sizes. We're seeing particularly strong traction with ShareFile in EMEA, where data residency is of particular concern. For example, a major global auditing firm chose ShareFile for better (15:49) sharing and mobility for their data delivery in Europe. We continue to drive rapid innovation with ShareFile, a true born-in-the-cloud service.","Speaking of the cloud, as we mentioned, our cloud transformation is clearly picking up momentum. We're seeing strong demand from both existing and new customers. As an example, Health Choice Network, a leading U.S. health information technology firm, chose Citrix Cloud to deliver on the company's new cloud-first strategy. HCN has been a Citrix customer for more than two decades, and now they felt that Citrix Cloud was the perfect fit for their digital transformation.","Another large cloud win was Capita Customer Management, a major European customer management outsourcing firm. Capita cited Citrix Cloud as the only solution that offered the agility, features and scale to deliver on their cloud-first strategy.","As we said (16:47) the past quarters, cybersecurity concern continued to be a growth catalyst for Citrix. We have been doing more to both drive the product innovation in the security space and appropriately adjust our positioning. Customers are increasingly viewing Citrix solution as a crucial piece of their security efforts.","For example, Hitachi, a long-time Citrix customer, now chose XenDesktop to deploy 80,000 Hitachi-made notebook thin clients for their current time and location-free work force initiative, driven by a need for increased security and also data protection.","A few notes on our partnerships, starting with Microsoft. I'm extremely excited to report that we released the cloud-native, multitenant app and desktop delivery services in Azure Marketplace the last week of March. In fact, we're trending in Azure Marketplace this week and already have 175 customers who have signed up to use these services.","Beyond that, we saw continued joint wins with Microsoft. In one such win against a major competitor, the Queensland Investment Corporation chose Citrix Cloud and Microsoft Azure in a large deal driven by strengths and trust of this partnership for their Windows 10 migration.","We also launched our partnership with Samsung, enabling a true Windows desktop experience on the new Galaxy S8. Fully executed in our strategy to secure delivery apps and data on any device. And, of course, we continue to see good execution and traction from our broad distributors and from our partner channel, and we'll continue to make it a big priority for Citrix as we continue in 2017.","Next month, we head to Orlando for Citrix Synergy 2017, our major user conference of the year. We will be making several major product and partnership announcements. We will also be hosting our Financial Analyst Meeting at the event, and I hope to see many of you in person there. Thank you. And as always, we look forward to your questions.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Operator, let's now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow. Your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick questions. First of all, the speed of the transition towards more subscriptions seems to be picking up here. Can you think about how you kind of continue to plan the business then? Because if you can't really plan what's coming on-premise, what's coming as subscription, I mean, can you help us understand a little bit about the speed that you can see here? Is it like a steady speed? Is it increasing, et cetera? And then, David, can you talk a little bit about, if I look at your investments at the moment and it looks more loaded into \u2013 it looks more focused on the first half, can you talk a little bit about the linearity for the year because I still try to get to the full year EPS number? Thank you.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Raimo. Let me start with the second question about investments. We did frontload a fair bit of investment this year. And so when you look at it in the aggregate, it would be fair to expect it to actually trend down as we go through the year. And let me point out a couple of things. First, there are incremental costs in period in the first half. For example, our big Synergy event, our Summit event, our partner event, et cetera, those are all first half initiatives. Also, there's a fair bit of our ongoing efficiency programs that have been held up a little bit just based on the GoTo spin that's done now. So those will float through in the back half of the year, frontloaded marketing and demand spend, things like that. So that's how you get to it on a modeling basis.","When you step back and think about the overall economic model, it is a shift going on. I think it's fair to say that we are managing that. We're actually holding it back a little bit. Customer demand and customer conversations are very strongly focused on cloud these days. It's aligned with where they're going and fortunately it's very much aligned with our strategic focus as well.","We are focused in 2017 much more on new customers. Of the cloud, in this period, 75% were new, 25% were installed base customers migrating. So that's a good dynamic. And we're going to keep that focused on net new for now and frankly keep a governor on it because as we've talked about a few times, this is our year to slowly ramp and make sure that we are hardened in the infrastructure areas that we need to be, et cetera.","And so we'll be building out our processes. And because of that, we'll have a better ability to manage the financial model. Our plan right now in May is to \u2013 at our Analyst Meeting to talk more about the longer-term economics and how it impacts the model. Obviously, the shift to subscription is a big upside from a customer lifetime value point of view, so the economics look great for us, and we just have to make sure it's managed effectively and appropriately within the financial model.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. A question to David and also just Kirill. On the shift to the cloud that's obviously impacting the recognized revenue upfront for the Workspace Services business, David, just in terms of the guidance that you guys have obviously reiterated for the full year, it seems to be progressing a little faster than you thought. How should we think about what you've baked in in terms of that shift kind of directionally maybe versus your original expectations? And how \u2013 Kirill, too, sort of what is driving this in your opinion?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of what we've baked in, I mean, and think about the mix that I referred to a couple of times in Q1 with about 20% of bookings coming out of the ratable-type license. There's a combination of term-based license, cloud, CSP, et cetera. CSP is \u2013 when we think of those kind of one by one, so CSP has been accelerating because we put more investment in that area. We've been investing in the capacity to recruit, onboard and manage those partners, and so that business has accelerated. Term and cloud are really just a function of how customers are looking to purchase software these days. I mean, you're seeing this increasing trend towards that, most likely driven by cloud and what a lot of other software vendors are doing from a solution point of view. So it's becoming much more common now.","We will manage that balance between term and cloud, obviously pushing towards cloud has customers are willing to accept that. But as I was telling Raimo, I think we'll manage that this year, keep the focus on new license, a little bit less so on the installed base, and we'll save that for when the real acceleration of the transformation over the next few years.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's absolutely correct. And just to build on what David just said, the balance is the key word. Building out of our cloud capabilities is the key word as we'll continue in 2017. And it's also worth noting the new services that we just launched on Microsoft Azure in their marketplace an opportunity that it creates, and in fact in the SMB segment, that historically we've not been able to reach.","We saw some early successes that are really positively surprising to many technical analysts who have been following us, like, for example, a customer who was able to get XenApp going in under four hours. And historically, in virtual client computing, as you've been following it on the technical side, it was just not possible. And now we have a solution that enables that to happen.","So we view that as sort of a balanced approach whereas David mentioned we will be regulating it and building out our capacity in the enterprise. At the same time, it opens up new opportunities for us in the lower end.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much. David, I was wondering \u2013 or Kirill \u2013 you mentioned reinvigorating the channel community. I'm wondering if you could share with us just a little bit more detail on what specific steps there you've made to kind of reinvigorate the channel. And how would you gage your success thus far? And then I just had a follow-up for David.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, I think \u2013 so, obviously we've been engaged with partners since the beginning of time at Citrix here. And last year we took a very deep view on what else we need to do to enable our partners. And it starts with enablement. It starts with education. It starts with sort of building up to enable their success.","Our Summit event in early part of Q1 was a central point of this reinvigoration with also new leadership that we've brought into the program. Some new adjustments to the program that we implemented in 2016 that are now starting to work and starting to pay dividends like our partner-sourced opportunities and shifting of our partner compensation to comp to essentially encourage that behavior. All of the things are in place, and we're starting to work.","But as I'm sure you're aware, to manage a large partner channel, and we have over 4,000 transacting partners in Q1, it is a process of continuous tweaking, and it's a process of continuous enablement and optimization. That's precisely what we plan to do for the remainder of the year.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then the follow-up for David, if I could, is just if I go back over the last, I don't know, probably three or four years, I always feel like Q1 people are usually on point with when you guide Q4, but it seems like we all seem to get Q2 seasonality wrong. And I guess I'm just wondering, how much of this is the business model shift versus just for your Q2 revenue guidance being a little bit below where people were looking versus kind of the shifting business dynamics that you mentioned?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I hate to say it but it's largely just a modeling exercise. Every year it seems to be the same drill. Because we haven't provide Q2 guidance at this point, there's a pretty wide range out there. So usually once we get past Q1, it starts to settle out for the balance of the year.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. That's what I thought. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. This is Tyler Radke on for Walter. David, I was hoping you could talk to us about the maintenance revenue. I thought it declined sequentially. Could you just kind of walk us through the reason for that?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes. Maintenance revenues, it's got a lot of moving parts in it right now as licenses are moving towards a cloud or subscription, things that are coming out of the base, and that'll show up in different parts of the P&L. But I think the more important thing around maintenance right now is you look at the shift that's ongoing towards CSS, and that's what's going to play out over the course starting right now but really over the back half of the year and into the next couple of years. We've talked about this a couple of times is that we've migrated to this new program. It's going to provide an incremental revenue stream that we've been estimating north of a couple hundred million dollars layered in over a few years.","The reason is that we are metering the increase to customers to not exceed a certain level year by year. I will say though, however, in Q1, the facts are better than what we had been modeling. We've had a faster level of adoption for customers doing a voluntary. In fact, the average ASP from a booking is up about 24% for those customers that are migrating, which is ahead of our original 15% planning estimate.","So just one data point \u2013 a couple of data points that give us confidence in hitting that transition with probably a more positive outcome than we had originally anticipated. And we're just trying really hard to make sure we're touching every customer, selling that value. You'll see that start to flow through the recognized license piece as we go into the next few quarters.","On a billings basis, obviously that's one of the things that contributed to the big growth in deferred revenue year-on-year and one of the reasons why billings is outpacing revenue by several percentage points in Q1.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And then just a follow-up on the cloud side and NetScaler. We've seen some hardware vendors talk about some impact from cloud spending or possibly the competitive environment. I was just hoping you could kind of touch on what you've seen there, if the cloud spending patterns or competitive situation changed at all.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure. Nothing unexpected. I mean, for the last six months, we've been talking about the cyclical patterns that we expect. Given that the first three quarters of last year were extremely strong, we expected two or three quarters of not as strong business as compared year-on-year. One of the stats I called out in my prepared remarks was that on a sequential basis, from Q4 to Q1, that cloud infrastructure spending on NetScaler was up over 100%. And so it is starting to come back, but it's compared year-on-year against a monster quarter in Q1 a year ago.","So we do expect the growth rates to be higher and stronger and positive in the second half of the year. Just the same thing we've been saying for the last couple of these calls. No real change in the overall competitive environment. Continues to be competitive but nothing unexpected.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes. And I'll just add that this is really the case where we continue to benefit from our software-first approach that enables us to deploy NetScaler in a broad range of form factors, including NetScaler-as-a-Service in both AWS and Azure, NetScaler Docker (31:13) container, and really benefit from this rapid shift to software-defined perimeter where we're now increasingly playing a role.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Two questions, David. And the one, what was the impact of greater-than-expected adoption of subscription in this quarter in terms of revenues and earnings? Can you quantify it for the quarter and for the guidance for the year? And secondly, how should we think about cash flow margin for the year? Should there be upside effect from the shift in the model? And was there any onetime impact on cash flows this quarter?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Okay, Abhey, let me parse out all those questions. Take the last one is in terms of onetime impact, there was a big onetime impact to cash flow related to the discontinued operations, really the GetGo spin, that was a negative impact of over $42 million, and so that's the largest of the one-offs. Cash flow is a little bit messy this quarter just because of that spin. We'll be reporting it on a very clean basis going forward and then calling out the GetGo business as discontinued operations in every prior period.","In terms of the actual impact on the quarter, we're not prepared to talk about a perpetual equivalent right now or try to normalize that. And I think it's a little too early for that given where the financial model is. But I'd say the best way to look at that in the short term is just the difference between billings and revenue and deferred and deferred expectation. Those are probably the places that I would point you to.","If I was looking at it, it would be in probably the ACV terms, and we are starting to measure the business this way. And we'll provide that level of incremental metric as we go through our Financial Analyst Meeting and talk about the multiyear transformation. At this point, I'd rather just keep it very focused on the reported financials.","Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And what's \u2013 about the cash flow margin for the year? And that's it for me.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I think cash flows are actually going to benefit as we go through this. I mean, we've got a couple of dynamics going on. We've talked about them a few times. A lot more in the case of multiyear transactions. We are still billing a large portion of those upfront. We are starting to build a balance of \u2013 well, what we can call unbilled backlog or off-balance sheet backlog. We're not planning on reporting that at this point. It is measured in the several million dollars this quarter, but it's not material at this time. So, fortunately, we'll be collecting a lot of cash from these multiyear transactions, and as we go into cloud, it will start to outpace revenue in the short term.","Abhey Rattan Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is actually Nikolay Beliov sitting in for Kash. You guys mentioned that APJ and EMEA bookings grew double digits and overall billings were up 5%. Can you please speak to the Americas business? That implies that maybe Americas was weaker in Q1. What happened there? Any puts and takes?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. This is the danger of talking about bookings because you're combining recognized plus the change in deferred, of course. But if I look at it on a recognized basis, Americas was up 1 point, APJ was up 10 points and EMEA was down a couple points.","On a bookings basis, I think the important takeaway is that all three geos exceeded plan. It's the first time in a long time we've had all three geos north of 100%. They all had nice positive growth there. So I'd probably want to just stay at that level and not try to go down too far because the real takeaway is the work that we've been doing in rebuilding the teams, the capacity and some of these execution challenges that we've talked about in the last year or so, really showing great progress.","The Americas team has been the growth engine of this business for a long time. They continue to do extremely well, and the improving results you've seen in the international geos are just going to help as we go through the balance of the year.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And as a follow-up, you mentioned that the win rate in Workspaces has been increasing in the marketplace despite the pressure from the shift to subscription. Can you please talk about why are you guys winning at an increasing the rate and how you are differentiated versus VMware? And are you seeing Amazon Workspaces in the marketplace? Thank you.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question. And we have seen an increased win rate and we have seen the record number of wins this quarter. Obviously, the product is the number one driver. We continue to innovate rapidly with our Xen family. Four releases in 2016, another very significant release in first quarter of 2017, full integration of Unidesk that adds to overall win momentum, and we've seen that it's really starting to make a difference. And it's very exciting to see.","I think our partnership with Microsoft, which essentially now has come to a point of sort of well-run operating machine. We spoke about \u2013 at least one win we can name and report. There were many more, and that continues to help. We still have unique capability for virtualizing of Skype for Business. We play very unique role in Windows 10 migrations. And all of that combined has certainly been driving the overall win rate. It's also fair to say that our field and our partner channel demonstrate a lot more energy and enthusiasm even compared to what we saw a year ago. And this is all a result of the continuous focus, continuous education and continuous cultural transformation of the company to be more courageous as we take on competitive situations.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen. Your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks very much and good afternoon, guys. Kirill how would you characterize sales cycle this quarter? And going forward, is there some risk of sales cycle elongation among your installed base as customers perhaps liberate the architecture that makes the most sense for them? How do you see that playing out? And then I just have a follow-up for David.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I think \u2013 I don't believe we've seen any material change in the sales cycle in Q1 in our core businesses. I think if we sort of look across the portfolio, I think we've seen probably a slightly accelerated velocity in XenApp, XenDesktop, primarily driven yet again by increased innovation and just by much more focus of being clear on what we deliver and articulating our value proposition with a whole lot more clarity than in the past. I think it's also the case where the entire company is being more focused and our strategy being much more aligned with our core product value proposition continued with slightly accelerated deal velocity.","In the networking space, in SD-WAN in particular, I would say that this is new market, and I would say it's driven by large transactions, and I think this is the place where proof of concepts are taking time, and people are really trying to assess what's going on. We continue to stay very focused on that. We're very bullish on SD-WAN going forward, and we certainly participate on those proof of concepts with our partners and also educating the channel. So I would say no material change. Slight acceleration in our core business on the deal velocity.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Thank you. And then just for David, I wanted to confirm because there's a little confusion among investors since I don't believe we have all the historicals ex GoTo from a balance sheet perspective. Did you say earlier that your total billings growth this quarter was 5% on an apples-to-apples basis?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes, I did.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the clarification.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Got a question for both; one for Kirill, one for David. As you discussed, the Microsoft partnership is helping, but is the partnership yet firing on all the cylinders? Or do you believe the ability, especially relating Azure, to drive acceleration adoption is still ahead of you? And then a follow-up.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question. I think Microsoft partnership, which has been in place for about a year now, sort of reached a point of operational maturity in most part of the world, and we continue to make it a truly global phenomenon. So I think while it's working in major geographies, I think there is opportunity for us to see more upside from that as we expand globally. And as you know, for that partnership, the most important thing is to get the sort of people on the ground in countries to work very closely together, and we continue to make sure it does happen as we made it happen in the center and have very good cadence of engagement.","I think there is an upside. Clearly there is an upside in XenApp, XenDesktop Essentials services that were just made available at the end of March on Azure Marketplace. And we view that as a great new opportunity. You can kind of characterize it as a second-party service. It's not first-party by Microsoft. It's branded Citrix, yet it is sold in Azure Marketplace by Microsoft, and early traction has been significant.","And on top of that, at the end of Q2, we plan to make available similar service for XenMobile, which is XenMobile Essentials, which is yet again a multi-tenant, cloud-native service released in Azure Marketplace as essentially a wrap or add-on to Intune and Microsoft EMS. And our sort of early signals from customers who previewed this solution has been incredibly positive and we're expecting good uplift from that solution as well.","So, great traction so far and yet we absolutely continued to see upside. And obviously with our major customer event coming up next month, we're certainly going be unveiling some other interesting tricks that we're going to do together with Microsoft.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Perfect. David, how should we think about the gross margin impact of the cloud shift both on this year and the longer term?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Mark. I mean, longer term, we'll talk about that later in the year. We'll preview some of that at our Analyst Meeting, but no impact this year. I think gross margins for 2017 are still going be in that range of 86%, 87% where we've been forecasting all year.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open.","Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Tom Mao on for Kirk. For Kirill, in terms of the booking strength for Workspace Services, do you feel like this is due to better execution on your end or kind of taking share versus competition? Or has there been a broader pickup in spending on desktop delivery technology? And if it's a bit of both, can you just provide some context on how we should think about these macro and micro factors?","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I think there is a broad set of factors. And first and foremost, we're a technology company and innovation is the number one driver for any uplift. And this is the case where focus on the core and investing in core product in the last 18 months is clearly paying off. So this is one. A few secular trends, cybersecurity. The fact that more and more customers are viewing virtual client computing as core part of laying down secure and a reliable architecture for their IT is certainly taking place, and we're seeing customers choosing XenApp, XenDesktop for securing of their enterprise. And this is across industries, financial services, health care, essentially across the board.","Win 10 migration is certainly serving as a sort of very important pivotal point in IQ re-architecture, and through that IQ re-architecture and move to Windows 10. We see customers shifting towards thin clients, whether it's a thin client \"laptop\" with Chromebooks where Citrix has a unique capability to offer to essentially legitimizing Chromebook in the enterprise or whether it's something like Raspberry Pi for larger screen type deployment. Yet again we have unique capabilities there through Citrix Receiver baked on a chip. So that's taken place.","And last but not least, we're seeing shifts to Citrix Cloud, and I think that shift is certainly also serving as a catalyst. Historically, we all know that one of the blockers for VDI adoption and for virtual client computing adoption in the enterprise has been complexity of the overall solution. It's not the easiest part of IT infrastructure. We also know that in the last five to seven years, we've seen continuous shortage and increased shortage of IT talent.","And so now we essentially, with Citrix Cloud, removed that complexity and all of a sudden made it easier for organizations of all sizes to adopt virtual cloud computing and VDI. And that's also served as a driver here.","So broad range of factors. I think it's \u2013 last quarter we said that 2016 was the year when we'll lay down the foundation for future growth in the core, and now we're seeing the results of that foundation being laid out. And all of that, coupled with strong execution in the field, David spoke about much-improved leadership and execution globally. We're seeing that taking place. And yet again, our global field organization being much more courageous as they talk on the competition and win against them with stronger product.","Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC","And just a follow-up to that, how are you thinking about M&A in terms of helping you continue this transition to the cloud?","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, as we've demonstrated in the last 12 months, we've favored tuck-in acquisitions that are clearly immediately benefit our customers and easy for us to integrate. And we always look for more and we look for more opportunities. That relates to sort of cloud foundation. This is really something that a company like Citrix needs to build and needs to own. And we've made huge progress building out Citrix Cloud and really laying down all of the operating tools that enable us to deliver that scale with high velocity. And obviously, we always look for ways to augment it with both parts of infrastructure that can help us and potential future M&A activities that would help us accelerate and add capabilities.","Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Austin Dietz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Austin Dietz phoning in for Michael. How much deployment both on-prem and in the cloud are you seeing with NetScaler VPX? Thanks.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. NetScaler VPX is still a minority product. I mean, from a volume standpoint, it would obviously be much, much higher than revenue. But on a revenue basis, it's generally 10% or 15% of the mix, units, of course, being much, much higher.","I don't think we have great visibility in terms of whether there \u2013 it depends on where the customer purchases them. If they purchase through a marketplace on one the mega clouds, of course, the assumption is it's being deployed in the cloud. If they purchase it through a typical license agreement, we're not sure exactly where they ultimately deploy that.","But I think the bigger takeaway it that it is a software solution and it gives you that flexibility, whether that cloud is a hybrid cloud that you own some of the infrastructure or it's a public cloud. And you can move those capabilities around very, very easily. And because we're a software-first solution, NetScaler allows you to do that, and whether that's VPX in a container focused on DevOps or in a traditional appliance form factor. And so that's our strategy from a product point of view.","Austin Dietz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the question. David, I had a quick clarifying question on the ARR of $275 million. On the 22% growth that you cited, did that (48:54) impact of the GoTo business, the GoTo portion of ARR?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","No. That's totally excluding all GoTo impact.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then I guess moving to the cloud transition, I think just from a philosophical point of view, is the operating principle in terms of how you're going to manage this transition, if the transitions happen faster than you expected, is that something that you guys would be happy with or do you guys feel you need to manage the transition of the cloud to sort of maintain the near-term, intermediate-term financial profile?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, I'd put the financial profile second, and I'll explain that in a minute. It's more a practical answer when it comes to just making sure that everything necessary to transform a company to a different model is in place. And that's true from a technical standpoint, from an infrastructure point of view, from systems and processes and people. And all those things take time. You want to make sure that you get it right so the customer has an amazing experience, and that's the primary reason why we meter.","If I look at it from a financial point of view, I mean, financially it provides a tremendous amount of upside long term from a customer lifetime value, assuming you get part A of that answer correct. And so that's why you've got to start there, get the foundation in place, get the processes in place and then help customers. And we'll add a tremendous amount of value when we do that, but that's the primary reason why we're throttling the growth rates.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I would just add that even the last two quarters, we spoke about our approach to cloud transition being crawl, walk, run, and we certainly in Q1 entered a walk year. And this is a bit of a speed walking, and we will continue to moderate our pace as we go through the year. We also see balanced demand from our customers, and I think the sort of operative word for a cloud transformation in 2017 will be balance.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. That's helpful context. And then just a last follow-up, and I know we'll probably get into this more on the Analyst Day, but just as a starting point of discussion, in terms of the gross margins on your cloud\/ratable business, approximately where do they stand today and where could we see that going once we sort of really start to accelerate in terms of scale?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I'd rather just hold off until we can talk about it at scale. It's not appropriate at this point. Let's stay focused on the 86%, 87% that's embedded in our guidance for the full year.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Look forward to the Analyst Day. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from Wells Fargo (sic) [RBC] (51:44). Your line is open.","Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt Hedberg from RBC. Kind of circling back to your comments during the call about cybersecurity becoming increasingly a catalyst, I know you had an article come out earlier in the month talking about GDPR. We hear that a lot from our security companies, maybe a little less from infrastructure. So could you talk a little bit about how GDPR could affect your European business and what products specifically you feel like it'd be benefiting?","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. That's a great question. And having spent a bit of time in EMEA during the quarter, I can certainly attest that GDPR is a big topic of conversation for CIOs and for our people and our partner channel as well. It comes into effect in 2018. We're absolutely going to be ready with all of our products and full compliance, and absolutely ready for the new regulation.","In our secure file sync and share solution, ShareFile, we have the unique capability. We have the unique capability compared to all of the other cloud-based file sync and share solution, and that is we have an option to deploy in customer managed zones, whether it's in the local cloud and whether it's on-prem. And I think this is certainly the case where ShareFile is likely going to be the beneficiary of this new regulation on an ongoing basis.","Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. And then if I could just have one follow-up. We talked a lot obviously about the shift towards more subscription and also a lot about the Microsoft partnership. With so many of their products now going cloud or subscription-based, do you feel like that partnership is at all accelerating this transition for you?","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I think this is certainly the case where Microsoft, along with other cloud infrastructure providers, has played a pivotal role in effectively convincing enterprises that cloud is something that they need to embrace. I think this is also the case where continuous improvement and performance, scalability and security of cloud offerings, whether it's driven by Microsoft or other cloud providers, is also serving as a catalyst of the broader cloud adoption and customers of all sizes. So we have certainly seen this. We have certainly absolutely seen this.","Also, Microsoft has been incredibly focused on Azure as a company, and that has certainly been a driver and been a catalyst for the overall broader cloud transformation in Microsoft customer base, where effectively we have a very, very strong presence. So, yes, indirectly it has been a driver and it continues to be a driver.","Matthew Swanson - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thank you for your time.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open.","Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. David, in the cash flow statement in the first quarter here there was a deferred tax item that added about $67.5 million. What's that related to and will it reverse over the course of the year?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes, I'd have to follow up with you on the detail of that. It's related to the GetGo spin, but in terms of how much of that is embedded, we'll follow up on that. If you look down the financial statement, it should be netted out by the impact of discontinuing operations.","Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. But below the line on \u2013 or is that in cash flow from ops?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, cash flow from ops. We'll follow up with you on much more granularity though.","Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to the presenters.","Kirill Tatarinov - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today, and thank you for following Citrix as we continue in our journey to transform the company. The new Citrix has clearly taken shape in the last few quarters and we look into the future with high degree of confidence, excitement and enthusiasm. Our vision is clear, our strategy is focused, and our execution and innovation engines are working well.

Mark?","Mark B. Templeton - Former President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Eduardo, and greetings everyone. I am really pleased with the strong results we're reporting today on my 70th and final Citrix earnings call. Over the past year, we've made many difficult, yet important decisions. I can only say how extremely proud I am of this dedicated Citrix team and the results they've produced. As you've seen in the press release, we're announcing the appointment of Bob Calderoni as Interim CEO. Bob is Executive Chairman of the Board and has been driving the operational review process we announced in July. These outcomes will be instrumental in shaping our 2016 plan and ongoing strategy. And the execution of that plan is our top priority. As a result, the Board and I believe this to be the right time for a transition, one that will ensure the continuity we need across the business in 2016 from financial, operational, and succession perspectives.","Since joining Citrix Board, Bob has helped us ask many insightful questions with the goal of unlocking margin expansion and efficiency. Both are critically important toward executing our ongoing business strategy. He's an accomplished and great executive to whom I'm happy to be passing the baton, while also providing assistance during the transition.","As I reflect, Steve Jobs had it right. The journey is the reward. No one has had a more interesting and blessed journey than me. When I came to Citrix in June 1995, I saw amazing potential in the company's vision, its culture and its opportunity to change the world. Today, the world's most important apps and data are protected, delivered, and managed with Citrix technology for millions of people, businesses, and governments around the world.","The number of hands and hearts in all of this, of employees, partners and customers, is practically infinite. What they all have in common is the belief in good. Good intentions, good service, good relationships, good outcomes, goods business, and nothing but authentic. For me, it's been a true privilege to be a set of those hands and one of those hearts, seeking to help people work better and live better. I would never have predicted we would grow to be one of the world's most important software companies.","As I look to the future for Citrix, I'm filled with optimism around the beliefs, principles, and vision that's defined us during my time, all from the little multi-user OS\/2 remote access company born in South Florida with vision, integrity, respect, humility and conviction.","Before I turn it over to David and Bob, I'd like to say a sincere thank you from the depths of my heart for believing in Citrix, for the privilege of leading, and for your confidence in me over so very many years. I'd like to add a very special thanks to our channel partners. It will always be lovely to see you again, my friends. And finally, my Citrix team, I wish you all God's blessings, good health and a fond farewell.","Oh, and one more thing. Citrix has been an experience beyond my wild dreams. As I reflect on the past 20 years, it reminds me of a lyric from the Moody Blues, my favorite band. I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band, the best band in all of software and that's Citrix.","So now let's hear David discuss the excellent business results we're reporting today. David?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Mark. And before I begin, I'd just like to say it's been a real honor and privilege to work alongside of you for the last 51 quarters, and I know I certainly speak for everyone at Citrix when I simply say thank you.","So let me turn to the quarter. First, I'm really pleased with our Q3 results and how they positively reflect the benefits of the actions we've taken since the start of the year to improve our operating margin, increase sales through our channel, leverage the integrations between NetScaler, XenApp and ShareFile and continue to grow our as-a-service offerings. Our results for Q3 reflect the progress the team has made in absorbing and adjusting to these initiatives, org and leadership evolution, and changes to our field and channel strategies. We're directing more of our energy towards our core strategy, the secure delivery of apps and data, setting the company up for even better execution, greater efficiency and profitable growth.","As you can see from the release, revenue is $813 million, adjusted operating margin was over 26%, adjusted EPS was $1.04 per share, up 38%, and we generated cash flow from operations of $260 million. In total, we closed 58, $1 million-plus transactions compared to 40 in the same quarter a year ago. The primary differences from last year were large orders for our Workspace Suite, which increased from three to 18, and from NetScaler which added five more than it did in Q3 a year ago.","From a geo perspective, when you exclude SaaS, total revenue in the Americas was up 9%, EMEA increased 2% in the quarter, but results in APAC declined 3% year-on-year. We do continue to see foreign exchange rate impact both demand and discounting internationally, but I'd say it was generally in line with our expectations in the quarter.","Looking at Q3 results within our three primary groups, our Workspace Services business grew slightly year-on-year to $396 million. We continue to drive the holistic conversation with customers about simplifying the delivery of their IT services, securely and efficiently, across all types of applications and data. While overall net new license revenue in this business declined modestly, this is the fifth quarter in a row that we saw improving year-on-year performance.","As we've reviewed previously, there's a number of initiatives that we're driving to improve results of this business through simplification, innovation and aggregation of our unique assets. As I said earlier, in Q3 we saw strong uptake for our Workspace Suite, our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, contributing 15% of license revenue for this group. It also drove the majority of the growth in long-term deferred revenue as a number of customers chose to enter into multi-year contracts.","Additionally, we continue to grow our CSP business, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver subscription based offerings to their customers. This quarter, the Windows app delivery CSP represented 10% of license revenue for this business, growing over 25% year-on-year. So we're delivering a complete mobility solution, allowing customers of all sizes to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility, on premises or service space, and do it all with a customer centric experience that only Citrix can provide. Next, in delivery networking, total revenue increased 21% in the quarter to $187 million. The strength in this business was driven by NetScaler, primarily in the segment of the business that's supporting cloud service providers. As you know, this segment is somewhat volatile over the first half of this year, rebounding nicely in Q3, and representing over 35% of the product mix in the quarter.","For more context on the overall business, let me touch on a few metrics. First, solution sales led to more than 650 virtualization orders that included networking as part of the overall solution. This is roughly a 10% attach rate as compared to just 8% a year ago. We sold over 2,200 unique customers in the period with 38% being net new customers. From a mix perspective, our SDX platform bookings increased 6%, MPX by 40%, and the VPX family of virtual appliances was up 20% in the quarter. So overall, a really strong period for networking.","And finally, our SaaS-based solutions delivered revenue of $191 million, up 15%. The communications cloud remains the largest part of this business, contributing nearly two-thirds of the mix and growing at 17%. In the workflow area, our secure data platform, ShareFile, was up almost 40% in subscription-based revenue, with the majority of this growth coming across document-centric verticals and our enterprise customers. Helping revenue growth has been the continuing focus on improving retention rates of the active customer base. This has been driven through extensive changes in product innovation, packaging, and customer care, all helping the net new business metrics increase significantly over a year ago.","So turning to operations. As I said, we're seeing results from the initiatives that we've been discussing with you over the past few quarters. In Q3, adjusted operating margin was up over 26%. That's 147 basis points sequentially, and up over 530 basis points from last year. In total, our operating expenses declined both sequentially and year-on-year, despite continued investments in our higher growth products. We're happy with the current progress on cost structure, and we see further opportunities to drive efficiencies and more focused growth throughout the company.","On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. The increase was due to strong cash flow from operations of $260 million that I mentioned earlier. Over a trailing 12-month period, cash flow from ops was $944 million representing approximately $5.80 a share. Similar to Q3 of the year ago, deferred revenue declined sequentially by about $30 million, although long-term deferred was up modestly due to multi-year customer engagements compared to last year. Deferred revenue is in total at $1.51 billion, up 8%.","And finally, while working concurrently on operations in our long-term business model, we've been very active with our capital return program. In mid-September, the Board authorized an increase of $500 million to our ongoing program. In Q3 alone, we returned about $280 million, repurchasing nearly 4 million shares. And since the beginning of Q4, we've continued this pace, repurchasing an additional 3 million shares to fully utilize this increased authorization in over just the past six weeks.","So turning to our current outlook and expectations for fiscal year 2015, I'd like to first provide some context around our guidance. As you know, the management team has been working with the Operations Committee of the Board on a comprehensive review of our portfolio, our cost structure, and our capital structure, and this includes the previously announced evaluations of strategic alternatives for ByteMobile and GoTo businesses. We expect to be completed with this work over the next few weeks, and plan to schedule an update for investors in mid-November to discuss the results of the review, as well as provide our financial outlook for 2016. So therefore, today, we'll only be providing an update to 2015 guidance.","We continue to optimize the business model by taking actions necessary to drive margin targets, streamline the organization, and simplify product focus on just our core growth markets. I think we've made a lot of progress as you can see, and we're confident that these actions can lead to even better execution, greater efficiency, and profitable growth. However, given the broad level of change occurring in our business, and the strong resulted delivered in Q3, we're going to remain mindful of the potential for short-term disruption in the balance of the year. So our expectations for the full year 2015 now include total revenue in the range of $3.24 billion to $3.25 billion, while increasing the adjusted EPS range to $3.85 to $3.90 per share.","So now, I'd like to turn it over to Bob. Bob?","Robert M. Calderoni - Interim President and CEO","Thank you, David. Before we turn to the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk today about the announcements regarding our leadership succession, and also our operating and strategic reviews. But first on behalf of the Board, I'd like to thank you Mark for your vision, your talent, and your leadership over the past two decades. Your contributions to our company, to our customers, and to the industry has been impressive, to say the least. The entire Citrix team wishes you the very best and thanks you for all of your dedicated leadership.","This afternoon we announced that the Board has appointed me as Interim President and CEO, and as many of you know, I've been a member of the Citrix Board since last year, and I'm currently serving as Executive Chairman. And I will maintain that role on the Board going forward. I've worked with many of you in the past, yet for some, I may be a new name. So by way of introduction, let me just say a few things. I have more than 25 years' experience in the software and tech industry. I most recently was CEO of Ariba from 2001 until we sold the company to SAP in 2013. And at Ariba, we led a successful transition from a low-growth, low-margin software business to a high-growth, high-margin cloud business through a combination of innovation and operational excellence.","Today, along with Godfrey Sullivan and Jesse Cohn, I'm also part of the Board's Search Committee. And as a reminder, we continue to work with Heidrick & Struggles to find a permanent CEO, and I see this as one of my primary responsibilities as Interim CEO. Pleased to say we're making good progress on this front. We're vetting several very capable candidates and we're prioritizing individuals who have a combination of proven operational expertise, along with a strong technology background to continue to build upon Citrix's technology and product leadership.","Another priority for me is to continue the momentum we have in our operational and strategic review of the business. As we announced in July, we formed an operating committee of the Board to identify opportunities to build upon our current trend of margin improvement as well as driving operational and capital efficiency in the business, as well as focus. It is this focus which I believe will eventually translate into even higher growth. I'm pleased here also to say that we're making good progress in these efforts, and as David mentioned earlier, we're close to completing our reviews, and we will be ready to report on our actions and plans in just a few weeks on analyst call.","My appointment to this interim role is intended to provide continuity while we move forward with the search process and the other strategic and operational initiatives that are focused on driving shareholder value. I can assure you that throughout the search process, Citrix remains committed to delivering for our customers and partners, in addition to executing on the transformative initiatives we announced in July. While the committee conducts its search, we're pleased to have a very strong and talented leadership team in place, and we're committed to successfully executing on the strategy, and I'm honored to be part of that team.","So with that, let's open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, and congratulations to both, the Interim CEO and to Mark Templeton on all that you've done so far. And I wish you the best going forward. Two questions from a operational point of view. Given the accelerated return of cash we've seen both in Q3 and the beginning of Q4, how should we think about return of cash for the remainder of this year and into next year? And then I have a quick follow-up question.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Mark. It's David. Let me take that. I mean, as you know we've been spending a lot of time talking about capital structure on a long-term basis. We've taken some actions last year where we returned over $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, I think including this quarter, we're at about $700 million. It's obviously been far and away our largest use of free cash flow and expect that one to continue. Thinking about capital structure longer-term, it's something that's on the top of our minds. There are some dependencies on a lot of the other activities that we're driving right now, and I think you should expect for us to come back to you beginning in November to talk about our longer-term position, but in the short-term expect free cash flow to be primarily used for share repurchase.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the cost cutting that's already been implemented, how much of that is left, how much is in the numbers we've seen so far in terms of the margin improvement and how much is still left?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","I think that we've identified a lot of areas in the near-term and over the course of the last three quarters. We've talked about fairly extensively whether that is simplifying our product portfolio against the key solutions that really create growth and differentiation long-term, organizational optimization and issues like that. And so it's an ongoing effort. I think the team has identified a lot of different areas that we're looking at and we'll be talking about more in the future.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I guess we'll be looking forward to more information shortly. Thanks on the great quarter.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. First of all, Mark, congrats on a great run and Godspeed. I'd like to ask about the SaaS business. Nice acceleration in growth.","What drove the acceleration of growth and how should we think about that growth rate going forward?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Steve. I mean you've seen the growth rate move up over the last couple of quarters, right? And that started at the back half of last year where our leadership team in the SaaS organization has been driving a real focus on, what we call, net new business. And that's just simply looking at the retention of the current install base as well as the efficiency of new sales going forward. And those things over time help drive recognized revenue, of course. So that's kind of point number one.","Point number two is the faster growing solutions like ShareFile, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, continue to become a larger and larger part of the overall business. And third, we continue to be active around new solutions and audio services, whether those are organic or acquired. And so I think, the balance of the year we should expect growth rates in this ballpark.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then I was wondering if you could offer any comment on \u2013 we looked at the core workspace services. You called out a strong Workspace Suite quarter. Are you seeing traction in the channel as well as direct sales with Workspace Suite?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think Workspace Suite, as everyone knows, is a solution that really brings together a lot of our capabilities across apps of any type, virtualization and data. It is the comprehensive solution and we're going to market with a lot of our enterprise transactions. And we've talked a lot about the channel in the first couple of quarters, and even have recruited and on-boarded channel executives to lead these efforts. So from a metrics point of view, the contribution from our CSA partners in Q3 was actually up double digits. We've seen positive growth in product sales in most geographies. We're seeing a growth in transacting partners. All these are very early activities, but I think we're focused on the right areas, and over the next several quarters, we'll be able to drive that.","The other area of partners that is important around the workspace services business is those that we call CSP's or Solution Providers. Those are the ones that I talk about that utilize primarily XenApp as infrastructure to deliver SaaS-based offerings to their end customers. And that's been a really important part of the story, and those folks have been driving revenue up more than 25% to 40% throughout this year. That is certainly impacted, to some degree, by currency as more than 50% of this revenue is outside the U.S. So the kind of organic growth in users is actually quite faster than recognized revenue.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter, and Mark, just all the best to you. Wanted to focus in on the networking side of the business, because if you look at sort of at least where our estimates were, that was sort of the most tough side (24:27) this quarter. And obviously you called out the service provider segment as growing nicely. Just wondering if you could double-click on that, provide some more details on sort of what changed this quarter versus maybe in the past couple of quarters and just how you think about that business going forward, because obviously it's pretty lumpy.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Phil. You are right and I agree. NetScaler had a great quarter. Overall networking was certainly the strongest part of the business. We've talked a lot about the concentration in the cloud service providers with a handful of the largest technology companies in the world, and their purchasing patterns tend to be somewhat volatile. And so historically what we've seen is their contribution to the mix be anywhere from 25% to 40% approximately in any given quarter. This quarter it was closer to 40%. It was actually just between 35% and 40% and that compares with the low end of the range a year ago. As everyone knows, it's a very, very important segment of the business, but it does mask a little bit all of the things that we've been doing to enhance the non-CSP \u2013 excuse me, the non-Service Provider or enterprise part of ADC. So when we take a step back and we look at the non-Service Provider business, that was still up in the high single digits year-on-year.","The reason that that's been growing is really a couple of things. One is the broader attach motion that I mentioned earlier. Customers are recognizing a lot of value by combining the virtualization and networking products together. We can create differentiated advantage there and it also gives us a platform to be able to continue expansion inside those accounts. The second is the unique approach we've taken from a technology point of view. Being a software company, it gives us a lot of flexibility to allow customers to grow with us as their needs grow without having to do forklift upgrades and other things. And then lastly, is just as we've been able to expand coverage and participate in more transactions, it's allowed us to grow that business. So it's really a combination of those two.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. This is Tyler Radke on for Walter. Just wanted to ask you guys about the guidance that you updated for the full year. Looks like you're maintaining the high end of the range at $3.25 billion. Just curious as we head into the fourth quarter, is there anything about seasonality we should be thinking of? I would just think, given the strong results here, maybe you would raise the top end of the guidance, but just any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Tyler, Q4 is always the largest quarter of the year, and it has some unique attributes to it. We certainly don't try to forecast those unknowns to happen in a period. And I think the way to interpret guidance is just like I said in my prepared remarks. We're really happy with the performance. We had a great Q3. The teams are working through a lot of the change that we initiated earlier this year. You see that especially in North America and the Americas in general where Q1 was absorption of a lot of volatility, and they've had good performance over the last couple of quarters. And we're working through that in international markets as well. So given the change, I think it's appropriate to be prudent right now with our outlook and shift a lot of our focus towards the cost structure initiatives, efficiency and those things that we've been talking about. So while we're maintaining the top end of the range on revenue, we're obviously bringing up profitability and EPS pretty significantly throughout the entire year.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And then a follow-up question on the workspace side of the business. You mentioned strong deals in the Workspace Suite, but can you talk about the rest of the business? Your competition made some comments yesterday that they believe they're gaining share. Just anything you're seeing in that business.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Let me talk about it at a high level first. From a competitive standpoint, it's a little challenging for us to get the exact data. As you know, most of those transactions are part of a much larger bundled deal. And so what we don't have is specific data in terms of deployments, or actual usage versus allocation. So that's the caveat. When we look at our business, it's really a tail of three segments, and this is oversimplification but bear with me. The CSP which I talked about, really servicing the SMB, mid-market customer, doing extremely well, cloud-based, it's all subscription and it's been growing north of 25%.","At the high end, that is where Workspace Suite, XenDesktop Platinum et cetera, really provide customers that set of capabilities to transform their business. And those are the types of transactions that we track very closely in our sales management system, and our win-loss has not changed on that. We still really dominate that space. I think it's the mid-market project-based activity, or the ones that we've been talking about through this year that we need to continue to put more of a focus on. And we're doing that through innovation. You're seeing a lot of new capabilities come out around XenApp and XenDesktop. The things that we're going to be doing with Workspace Cloud and really more of a late 2016 and 2017 part of the story, but focused on abstracting away that complexity for customers that comes with enterprise infrastructure to allow them to absorb and go faster. Those are the types of activities that I think you should keep an eye on over the next several quarters about growing that business.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. First of all quick question for Bob. Bob, at Ariba you went through that transition towards more of a subscription-based business. What were the key things that you kind of took away at Ariba that you think we need to be aware of, if you think about Citrix and the changes there? And then I have one for David afterwards.","Robert M. Calderoni - Interim President and CEO","Yeah. I think what I learned at Ariba was success comes through a combination of both operational excellence and innovation. After all, it's a technology business that we're in and you can't discount innovation. This company here at Citrix has plenty of innovation. The strategy has been narrowed and focused recently around secure delivery of apps and data. And I think the next turn of the crank here now is just to get the organization focused around that very focused strategy of delivering of apps and data. And that's where the operational excellence will come from. You put together excellent innovation and excellent operations and I think you can create tremendous shareholder value, and I think the makings for that are here, right here at Citrix.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you. And one quick question for David. Like, if I look at the performance on the networking side of the business, I seem to remember from the Analyst Day a couple of months ago, one of the big focuses was that the sales force set up we wanted to change a little bit to make sure that we have more dedicated people in there. Can you talk about the progress there, please?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Sure, Raimo. We're evolving. It's fairly early days. We've got certainly more consistent focus across North America in particular. That team is executing well. Obviously North America is what drove a lot of the upside, just based on the total numbers that you saw me talk about earlier. I'd say we're going to continue a lot of work across this in the next several quarters, looking at areas where we've got opportunities to add more capacity, more go-to-market distribution, more differentiation, et cetera. So happy with the progress for sure, still see opportunities in the future.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Lovely. Thank you, and Mark, thanks for all your great work at Citrix. Thank you.","Mark B. Templeton - Former President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you. And I'll echo everyone's best wishes, Mark. I just wanted to focus, David, on what you think \u2013 I know you're going to announce the review of kind of the operational procedures that you've been going through, but at least going back to Mark Moerdler's original question. When you think about the operational efficiencies and kind of how far you are through what you've been able to achieve, can you give us a sense of ex-those, kind of how much more there is left in what you originally laid out in \u2013 I think it was in January? And then I had a follow-up just on the MDM market following up a little bit on some of the comments that were made last night. Growth rates for those businesses seem to have slowed for kind of everyone in the market. Just trying to get a sense of what you're seeing from a pricing and bundling perspective. Thank you.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Heather. I think that similar to Mark's question, it's not as simple as saying that there's a short list of things and we're 75% of the way through. I just don't think that it's fair. I think that you've got to take a little step back and think about cost structure, focus of the strategy, and really put it all together. So what we've been doing and what we will be talking about in November is much broader than that around the product portfolio, the strategy and the focal areas and then how we're thinking about cost structure over the next couple of years. I think that the team has identified lots of near-term opportunities that you've seen. And when we entered this year, we talked about the beginning of a multi-year expansion of operating margins. That's probably the easiest way for everyone to keep track of our progress. That's the focus that we've been on. We said that we would expand by hundred basis points at a minimum in 2015. We're clearly two and a half times that right now and we see further opportunity. And so that's really the way to think about it but I would put off any specific comments until we get completed with our work, and we can talk about it much more holistically and give you a longer-term outlook at that point.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great and then the MDM market?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. MDM market, I'd say that our focus really hasn't been on MDM, as everyone knows. I mean, our focus has really gone from the other end of the wire and then, talking to customers about a solution for optimizing applications of all type and driving enterprise mobility. And so, from that respect, that's been our approach. And a lot of our mobility sales right now are actually coming through Workspace Suite and other large solutions like that. And so we don't have to be stuck down in the pure-MDM where it's highly commoditized, et cetera. I'd say that there's a lot going on, certainly with Microsoft, everyone knows. I've seen those comments just recently. I'd say that their continued success with Intern (35:58) is probably hurting a lot of the pure-play MDM vendors, and we don't see that as directly.","I think it's a really good thing for us, because we have a fantastic relationship with Microsoft over the last 20 years. Our approach to mobility will be similar to our approach to virtualization on the desktop, embrace and extend a great platform, look for opportunities to partner going forward, and really make it a win-win. And so that's been our approach, and I think that'll continue to be our approach.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire from CLSA. Your line is open.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","And Mark, I just want to say that it's been a pleasure dealing with your vision and heart over the years. And I am confident that you'll be very much missed. I wanted to focus on Windows 10. There's some debate about how much lift it may actually have impact on the workspace business and the desktop, in particular. But as you look at the business over the last few years, it's become less closely coupled to PC cycles. And I'd like to get your view on the impact of the Windows 10 adoption cycle on your business as you're approaching it now.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Ed. It's David. I'd say that as everyone saw the Window 10 launch and Citrix positioned as a migration partner and that's just a proof-point example of our great long-standing relationship with Microsoft. And similar to my comments that I made around MDM that Heather asked, I mean we've always had that approach of embrace and extend the platform. I think everyone recognizes that Windows 10's a great platform. And we expect to see a lot of uptake over the next many quarters. I think that the broader conversation of course is a little bit less about the desktop OS as a standalone than it was five years ago, and much more about the broader delivery of apps than data, in a bit more of a generic context. And that's where we're really focused. And the things that we can do to make that any message, any app, any device, any network, any hypervisor, et cetera is very important. So that's what we'll take, and it'll be a part of the sales tools, and a kit that we work in conjunction with Microsoft. But give us a couple of quarters and we give you more specific data.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. And just a quick follow up on Asia. You're seeing weakness there. And I think there's been some concern that the weakness in that region may spread further. What's \u2013 tone of business in the channel and as far as you can see it, how do you look at the disruption that we're seeing in the Asian market? And do you see it really being contained regionally?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think there's been a lot of discussion obviously about China and the impact there. And we've certainly seen that be a challenging market over the last few quarters and it continues to be so. In addition to that, we are also going through a consolidation right now of our APAC and Japan region kind of into a single larger structure. And that's causing a little bit more just on a disruption point of view. And so we need to work through that, but I'd say the way I'd frame it up economically is volatile and maybe trending slightly down, but within expectations.","Edward Everett Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much and Mark, best wishes and congratulations on just everything that you've accomplished over the years. So David, I wanted to just ask you about average transaction size for larger deals which I think last quarter increased by 5% to 10% year-over-year. And I'm wondering if you would share with us what you saw with respect to the Q3?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, there was no real anomalies in terms of extremely large deals. We talked about the actual number of large transactions bumped up pretty significantly; the average transaction size was actually just about flat.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just secondly, gross margins have kind of reached that long talked about 84% to 85% range. Are you still expecting gross margins to plateau from here?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yep. I think definitely. It'll move around based on just the mix of revenue like you saw in Q3, but I think this should be the plateau point that we've talked about.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Falzon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Thanks. Hi, it's Kirk. Mark, best of luck going forward; it's been a pleasure working with you. I guess my question for you guys going forward's going to be, David, when you think about the \u2013 or actually I guess my question was more around the SaaS business, a little bit in front of what we're expecting. Can you just talk a little bit about that? Are we getting to the point now where some of the lagging products are getting smaller as a percentage of the mix, and you're starting to see more of the growth from solutions like ShareFile come through? Sorry if this was asked earlier, but I just jumped on. Thanks.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Kirk. I think your question was just a little bit more granularity into that business. And like we've talked about for quite some time, we've seen just the faster-growing components be a larger, larger part of the overall mix. And that's certainly influencing the broad business. As you'd imagine, there is one mature business in there around GoToMyPC. We've talked very openly about that. But I think more importantly than just the secular pressures going on in some of the individual markets, it's really focus on the work that the team has been doing over the last year. I talked about it on one of the earlier questions where the real focus has shifted from just driving gross sales to one that's focused much more on retention of the base, product innovation, differentiation, et cetera, and that's really helped. And that's driving not only a more cohesive product portfolio and set of solutions for customers, but really driving better execution. And so that's going to be a continued focus as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open.","James Wesman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey guys, good afternoon. It's James Wesman filling in for Michael. Dave, can you give us a little bit more color on the enterprise side of the NetScaler business and how it did relative to the cloud service providers? And also, for delivery networking as a whole, what's your outlook on the business for the remainder of the year? Thanks.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I think that delivery networking as a whole, it's a good market. Our performance in the cloud service providers will allow for more volatility; it's just a fact. It's a very important part of the business. We have extremely high share, and so the purchasing patterns of those customers impact our results. Doesn't change the strategic positioning, of course, and so when I talk about everything but that, I think it gives a better picture of the enterprise market. And that business was up about high single digits in the quarter and demonstrating some of the traction points that I referenced in an earlier call.","James Wesman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Ma - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Howard Ma in for John. Thanks for taking the question. A big part of your strength in billings appears to have come from a nice bump in long-term deferred revenue, which, in your prepared remarks, you said came from workspace customers choosing to enter into longer year deals. David, could you just comment on how sustainable this change is as well as any other notable changes in billings duration?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, that's really been the change that we've talked about over the last several quarters. I mean, we've never made it an intention to push multi-year transactions very aggressively. It just seems to be that, customers, when they're looking to buy a piece of enterprise technology, want to lock in a little bit longer. So that's something the customers have been driving. We had actually one of the larger transactions in the Workspace Suite area. Windows app delivery was a term-based license in the period with a large government entity. And so those do come up. And when you have a multi-million dollar term-based deal, we'll recognize it ratably over the next several years. But I'd say that's a transition that will continue at probably the same pace that you've seen up to this point. Like I said, we're not trying to drive it that aggressively, but we'll follow what customers are looking for. I hope that answers your question, Howard.","Howard Ma - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, thanks. It does, David. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Stan (45:26) for Keith. Wanted to talk about the Federal business and how that performed relative to your expectations in Q3. And if you would also maybe speak to maybe the enterprise business sort of ex the Fed, how'd that come in relative to expectations.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Fed was as expected. Fed always has a good Q3. In terms of overall enterprise business, like you've seen in North America, it was particularly strong. That team had a great quarter and so that was really the standout in the period.","Unknown Speaker","And to sort of follow-up, as we look to the big enterprise quarter in Q4, how do you feel about the pipeline coming into Q4 this year versus last year?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","We don't break out the exact numbers, but in terms of opportunity pipe there's certainly a huge focus internally, as you'd imagine.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","There's plenty of opportunity there. It's always an execution story.","Unknown Speaker","Appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Your line is open.","Alper Tuken - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys this is Alper Tuken in for Bhavan. Just had a quick question on the product and license revenue growth, kind of, from a higher level. I know you guys saw almost about 7% growth in the quarter after kind of seeing decreases in the previous four quarters, and I was just more so wondering how you guys see license growth moving forward, if you think that you'll kind of see up into the right trend to end 2015 and kind of into fiscal 2016.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean it's like we've talked about for the last couple of quarters. We're focused on those solutions that are going to grow and drive the business into the future. So obviously our growth rates are impacted a little bit by things that we've been deemphasizing or discontinuing, et cetera. That puts a little bit of a headwind out there. Clearly we had a strong NetScaler quarter which we talked about. And as those come in, those will disproportionately impact the reported results. We obviously believe that the markets that we're in will support a business growing significantly faster than Citrix is right now. That's a large focus of why we're going through operational reviews, simplifying the strategy and really focusing our efforts on the things that are going to drive long-term profitable growth. And that's the way we're thinking about it. And certainly based on Bob's remarks, we'll be talking about that more in November.","Alper Tuken - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys. Thanks very much. This is Parthiv (48:17) in for Abhey. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the future of the desktop business. How do you sort of differentiate yourself versus VMware because they seem to be nudging some traction in the space? Thanks.","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","You know, I think that it's interesting because our position in desktop and application virtualization is largely one that goes back to inventing the market. We've got the kind of capabilities for doing this over the last 20 years that will give us tremendous breadth and depth. I think that we've always been able to differentiate across the ideas of security, experience, and flexibility. The idea of any app, any network, any device, any hypervisor, et cetera is just a core part of what we do. We partner with the best \u2013 important companies out there to deliver these capabilities whether it's Microsoft, IBM or others, and we're continuing to innovate very aggressively. You've seen innovations hit the market fairly recently around protocol capabilities. And really what that means is just performance. We've got by far and away the best performing endpoints that are out there. That's what customers care about and that's the kind of thing that we're going to continue to deliver.","I'd say that our innovation rate across app and desktop virtualization is on an uptake right now. We're focusing a lot more effort in that area. And you're seeing that come out with our new products.","The other thing which is still bit of a future, but the Citrix Workspace Cloud where the idea is to be able to give customers a simplified infrastructure where they can adopt these technologies, realize value in a more rapid fashion, and be able to scale without the effective overhead of a lot of enterprise on-prem technologies. And so that's a focus area as well. And so you put all these things together, it's a very strategic market for us. We've built a well over $1 billion business here, and we believe we can continue to grow that into the future.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Zeller from Needham. Your line is open.","Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. I may have missed it earlier, but wanted to ask about the license performance within the networking group. And also, could you please tell us the remaining capacity in the share buyback program?","David James Henshall - Chief Operations Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. We don't really break out the individual product license numbers, but based on my comments, you can infer that the license revenue in the networking obviously contributed all of the upside, if the other part of the business was down a little bit. And so that's probably the way to think about it there. In terms of the buyback, we have roughly $100 million left in the current authorization, but that is simply a conversation that we have in the broader context of capital return. So we'll continue to have that with the Board as part of this operations review, and we'll talk more about that in November.","Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for today's third quarter 2016 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be Kirill Tatarinov, President and Chief Executive Officer and David Henschel, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems investor relations website. ","The webcast will be posted immediately following the call. Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our investor relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Securities Law. ","These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ to those anticipated.

A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the investor relations page of our website. Now I'd like to turn it over to David Henschel, our COO and CFO. David? ","David Henshall","Thanks, Eduardo and welcome to everyone joining us today. We continue to show great results and overall execution from the operational initiatives that have been driving profitability to the strength in product portfolio been driving top line growth. We're focusing all of our energy on the core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, really setting the company up for sustainable profitable growth as we look forward. As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 3% year-on-year in Q3. Adjusted operating margin expanded to over 30%. Adjusted EPS was $1.32 per share, up 27% year on year and we generated nearly $290 million in cash flow from ops.","In total, we closed 49 $1 million-plus transactions with particular strength in cloud, healthcare, technology and government verticals. There was also good balance across portfolio with more than half of these deals coming from Workspace Services with the balance coming from Networking. From a geographic perspective, when you exclude the GoTo businesses, revenue from the Americas was up 8%, APJ was flat and the EMEA market declined about 4%. This performance is pretty consistent with the first half of the year. The Americas GEO continues to drive significant growth across all product categories, while the other regions are seeing improving execution in many of our primary markets. Related to this, in Q3 we announced a leadership change in the APJ region and pending change in the UK and these things will help accelerate field restructuring into 2017. ","Next, I want to talk about Q3 results within our three primary businesses. Within Workspace Service business which includes Virtualization and Mobility, grew 5% total to $414 million, including a 5% year-on-year increase in product license revenue. This growth rate has been really moving up over the last six quarters and is a direct result of the focused strategy we adopted last year. ","As we've discussed a few times, there's a number of very specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through much faster innovation, more verticalized solutions, integration of our unique assets across the portfolio and the reinvigoration of our channel partnership. A couple of other dynamics are worth noting. That includes the license revenue in the Americas GEO with -- across all of Workspace Services actually accelerated last quarter. ","In Q3 this was up 18% year-on-year and this is after already posting 16% license growth through the first half of the year. Much of this has been coming from mid, large enterprise customers, often in verticals where security and compliance our major concerns. Additionally, we continue to grow our Cloud Service Provider subscriptions where our partners are primarily utilizing XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings their customers. Overall, the Citrix Service Provider revenue grew about 30% to now have an ARR of over $75 million. Next, looking at Delivery Networking, total revenue increased 1% in the quarter to $191 million. The largest part of this overall business, NetScaler ADC, posted license revenue growth of 5% against a strong Q3 a year ago. ","But impacting the results in the rest of the EU were the comps from the ByteMobile and Cloud platform products that are part of the restructuring at the start of this year. Staying on NetScaler for a minute, I will remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of three segments. Cloud Infrastructure and e-Commerce, Citrix solution sales and enterprise ADC. So within the quarter, demand from cloud and e-commerce continued to be really strong consistent with what we have seen over the last five quarters. ","This segment which is made up of roughly 200 different customers in the quarter, contributed about 40% of NetScaler product sales. Solution Attach segment represented 15% of the mix with a number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of an overall Citrix solution was up modestly from a year ago. And then Enterprise ADC was the remaining 45% of mix. All in, we sold over 1,600 networking customers during the period with a third of those being net new to Citrix. And finally, our SaaS delivered revenue was up 9% to $207 million in the quarter. ","The contribution from the GoTo business was $173 million. And as far as the merger between GoTo and LogMeIn, we received U.S. antitrust approval in September and continue to expect this to close in the Q1 2017 timeframe. When you look at just the cloud-based services that are part of core Citrix, we delivered $35 million in total revenue, growing 28% in the quarter. ","The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, with the other new offerings addressing workspaces and service needs for our customers. So clearly, we continue to see a shift in the way products are being consumed by customers, evolving slowly towards a more ratable model. ","So when you include revenue that is being generated from the Citrix Service Provider Program, plus our own cloud-based services and the annual term license, the aggregate ARR is now over $225 million, growing very rapidly. So turning to operations, we have driven a lot of efficiencies in the Company over the past six quarters and continue to do so in Q3. The actions across the business were designed to generate permanent expense reductions while reallocating investments to those areas that will drive profitable growth in the future. ","In Q3 adjusted operating margin was over 30%. This is up more than 400 basis points from last year. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% full-year margins in 2017. The focus on leverage has also helped increase our cash flow profile for the Company. Q3 cash flow from operations was a record $288 million and over the trailing 12 months we have generated a total of $1.14 billion in cash from ops and this is up 21%. As you start to model FY17, I want to point out that historically about 80% to 90% of cash flow from operations can be attributed to core Citrix business with the remainder coming from GoTo. Exiting Q3 we had nearly $2.5 billion in cash investments on the balance sheet which is up sharply from last quarter. ","Over the last several years our stated target has been to utilize half of free cash flow for capital return, a level which, frankly, we have regularly exceeded. As you know, this program has been on hold due to the pending separation of the GoTo business. So once that's completed, we intend to restart our programmatic capital return and we'll talk definitively about those plans once the transaction is closed. ","Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our growth strategy and operational programs are clearly working. We're happy with the results and we're confident in our plans for the balance of the year and looking into 2017. ","At the same time, we're going to continue our conservative outlook given the pending GoTo merger with LogMeIn and the significant revenue upside we posted in Q4 of last year. That said, we're increasing our assumptions for Q4 and the full year. So for 2016, we now expect consolidated revenue between $3.4 billion and $3.41 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.18 to $5.20 a share. ","This represents revenue for core Citrix to be in a range of $2.71 billion to $2.72 billion or roughly 3.5 -- or excuse me, 2.5% to 3.5% growth when you exclude the GoTo business. With respect to 2017, we're just finishing up our planning cycle which is very normal for this point in Q4. At this stage we still expect the GoTo merger to be completed in Q1 2017 so we're completely focused on the ongoing business of core Citrix. ","We're feeling good about the continued improvement in results, the new product cycles and the early returns from Citrix Cloud. We're also making a go-to-market capacity investment that should drive additional growth next year, particularly in the second half of 2017. ","Therefore, we're currently modeling 2017 full-year revenue growth of 3% to 4% for core Citrix and adjusted operating margins of 32% to 33%. So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward. Kirill? ","Kirill Tatarinov","Thank you, David and hello and welcome, everyone. I am obviously very pleased with our results, clearly demonstrating how our new focus is resonating in the marketplace. We have seen growth in all of our core areas of business, most importantly, in our Workspace Services business, showing growth for the second consecutive quarter. Our efforts in accelerating product innovation and improving operational processes are working. And the progress on cultural transformation that defines us as a company will continue to power us forward.","We're seeing improved stability in our workforce and incredibly strong employee engagement as evidenced by very strong results and participation in our recent global employee survey. Specific to our field organization, through these improvements we now have approximately 100 more quota-carrying reps since our restructuring about a year ago. Our Americas sales team continues to fire on all cylinders with consistently strong execution quarter-after quarter. And with the leadership changes we have implemented in APJ and more change of upcoming in EMEA, we see great opportunity to replicate what is working so strongly in the Americas.","Our vision is clear, our strategy is crisp and our execution has improved dramatically. We now have had five straight quarters of continuous operating improvement. A few additional comments on our solution areas, there's a big story this quarter, of course, Workspace Services or our Xen family. It's exciting to see this core part of our business delivering 5% year-over-year increase in the license revenue. I'm encouraged by sales energy and tremendous product innovation in this area. After two quarters of solid growth, this is clearly not a fluke or just blip on the radar. This is an exciting change deliberately driven by the strongest, highly differentiated products and much improved competitive edge.","Additionally, in September and we delivered XenApp's XenDesktop 7.11, a major release featuring day one support for Windows Server 2016, management innovations and user experience enhancements. We also acquired more NorthScale, greatly complementary technology that adds extra capabilities in the user environment management adds has very smart workspace performance organization techniques unmatched in the industry. We saw more than 650 competitive wins in the virtual clients computing this quarter and our win rates have been consistently improving.","Specifically, one of the nation's largest grocery retail and supply chain services companies chose XenDesktop for VGI delivery to support the retail operations, thanks to our partnership with Microsoft. And another major win against the top competitor in the space, one of the world's largest insurance providers chose to leverage XenDesktop to enable the efficient upgrade to Windows 10 on more than 20,000 desktops, also driven by our unique support for Skype for business. We continue to see more customers choosing our entire portfolio due to stronger than ever product integration. For example, in a dual competitive win, a top clinical teaching hospital in the Netherlands is rethinking their workspace services end-to-end and chose Citrix Workspace's suite against both the virtualization competitor and the networking competitor so they can implement a full, coherent solution for hospital workplace innovation. ","Moving onto Network Delivery business, as David mentioned, we saw good growth in the core ADC area with a 5% year-over-year increase from the already strong Q3 in 2015. On the product innovation front, we released a major update to NetScaler SD-WAN. We continue to be very encouraged by growth in that area. This update featured more advanced routing, simple deployment and unrivaled security capabilities. We also released NetScaler support for the fixed standard, a testament to our commitment to security and the U.S. Federal Government.","And we released NetScaler CPX, a free developer version of NetScaler in a container that allows for rapid deployment methodologies such as DevOps. It is a clear indicator for our team's focus on new technologies and increased innovation. We saw more than 500 competitive wins in the network delivery space globally, including a major African mobile communications company, a major international electronics company and a global technology company. All of which are using NetScaler to ensure high network availability, resilience and security in their services. On to data delivery. As with previous quarters, ShareFile continued to prove itself is a growing force in the enterprise file sync and share market, growing 25% year-over-year. We continued to drive rapid product innovation and expand ShareFile functionality in target industries, adding more workflows and cloud connectors.","We're starting to see increased traction of ShareFile outside of the United States where it is still the strongest and in the larger enterprise segment. Specifically, Daimler AG, one of the largest and well known producers of the premium cars and manufacturers of commercial vehicles, chose Citrix ShareFile to improve large file exchange across their organization and it will help them reduce storage costs and support business departments when dealing with big amounts of data.","On to the industry trends. Cybersecurity, bring your own device phenomenon, cloud adoption and Microsoft refresh cycle all served as catalysts to our business in Q3. We saw strong demand for our solutions to support organizations initiatives to secure their data applications and networks. This is particularly evident in highly regulated industries including financial services and healthcare which had more than a dozen large deals this quarter, as David mentioned. We also had several defense ministries and government agencies around the world choosing Citrix to address security concerns. With cybersecurity being the number one concern for enterprises of all sizes and governments around the world, it is becoming increasingly evident that Citrix solutions are indeed one of the strongest defenses against potential end point device and perimeter attacks.","Moving on to our progress in the cloud, this was a tremendous quarter in our cloud transformation. While it's still in early progress, the momentum is building with wins coming from businesses of all sizes. Highlighting just a few examples. Hilti, a well-known provider of worldwide leading edge technology for international construction professionals has partnered with us to drive their cloud transformation and enable the bring-your-own device policy for employees through Citrix Cloud. Columbia University and another major Ivy League school both chose Citrix Cloud to assist in their transition and reduce infrastructure costs and IT support needs. Citrix Cloud overall is really starting to shine.","A couple of remarks on our partnerships, this quarter we saw major step forward in our stronger than ever relationship with Microsoft. As you may recall, earlier this year we had announced an elevated and more strategic partnership with Microsoft and now I am happy to report that it is starting to bear fruit. We're seeing good alignment of our teams in the field bringing those joint wins I previously mentioned. Also in August, Microsoft announced that they were transitioning out of Azure RemoteApp and Citrix XenApp was designated as the destination for Azure RemoteApp customers. We're creating a clear migration path for Azure RemoteApp customers that want to use all of XenApp capabilities.","This announcement served as a continued vote of confidence that Citrix is clearly the right partner for future success to deliver more workloads than ever and more adoption of Windows 10 and Office 365. As to our broader partner channel, the momentum is continuing to grow. And while we have nearly 50 $1 million-plus deals in Q3, the ShareFile sales coming from the mid-market is increasing. Clear signal that our strategy to expand in mid market is working and that our partner channel is more vibrant than ever. Just last week we hosted our top partners in the Americas to give us tremendous feedback on our mutual progress. And last, but certainly not least, last month we had our annual industry analyst event where we had the opportunity to share our vision, strategy and core messaging. The feedback was remarkable.","I previously shared the confidence I heard from our customers and partners and now hearing such positive reinforcement on our direction and focus from industry analysts was truly encouraging. Our strategy and overall positioning was very well received, proving to me that we're on the right path. As I mentioned, with highly differentiated products we have stepped up our competitive edge and it is paying off. We're taking share in all our core areas of business. ","Overall, I feel very enthusiastic about the business and look forward to closing out the year strong and starting 2017 with Citrix been better and stronger than ever. Thank you. And we look forward to your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Raimo Lenschow ","Kirill question for you, the workspace growth rate of 5% was the best we've seen since I am looking back here at Q1, 2014. You mentioned some of the strength already. How confident are you that we're -- could you get a little bit deeper into what drove that growth and how confident are you that kind of that number that you can deliver in the future as well. Thank you. ","Kirill Tatarinov","Thanks for the question. And obviously we're incredibly excited with the continued strength in this core part of our business. This is the second quarter and a 5% growth in license is truly remarkable. As I mentioned, it is driven by tremendous strength in our products. We just simply never had such a strong technology and the team has done a remarkable job innovating this. 7.9 release coming out at about Synergy Conference in May was very strong and is driving tremendous adoption and we have just made it even stronger with 7.11 release and with a small tuck in acquisition of Norskale.","I think it's also fair to say that Virtual Client Computing in many cases is viewed as sort of one of the core parts in cybersecurity efforts that everybody is driving and we're seeing it from regulated industries. We're seeing it from the governments, we certainly see that trend driving the business forward. And I expect that wanted to continue to and wanted to accelerator and last but not least, we're in the midst of very significant refresh cycle in Microsoft environments driven by Windows 10 adoption and recent introduction of Windows Server 2016. And I think also coupled with Office 365 and Broad adoption and unique support that we have for Skype for Business that will continue to be very significant growth catalyst.","So very encouraged by what we saw in Q3 and certainly feel very enthusiastic and bullish about future prospects in this core part of our business. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Walter Pritchard ","Kirill we've heard you talk a lot about security on the call and I guess I think security has been part of your value proposition for a long time. Is there something that's changing in that regard either from features that you put in the new release of the product or something you're seeing in the market that\u2019s different than what you'd had in the past? ","Kirill Tatarinov","I think there are a lot of things that's happening in the market and I think that overall awareness of cybersecurity is escalating quite dramatically. Even in the last Presidential debate we heard about cybersecurity, I think it's for the first time in history and I think it certainly served as a call to action too many [ph] and continuous escalation that we see from attackers being [indiscernible] a few years ago to organized crime to now real governments and cyber terrorists. This is certainly a major threat that everybody is feeling and everybody is experiencing and people are starting to see virtual client computing our core business is one of the major defenses and many people realize that essentially virtualizing their device may be one of the only ways they can truly secure the data and secure the device. ","So certainly secular trend is helping. From the product perspective, we definitely continue to amp it up across the portfolio. With NetScaler capabilities that were released in June with updates to the entire NetScaler portfolio and NetScaler gateway serving as essentially conditional access with multiple factors indication that many customers are starting to deploy with information rights management being introduced into ShareFile and with continuous improvement in our core business in apps and desktop certainly from the product point of view we\u2019ve continued to drive improvements.","But I would say last but not least is the overall awareness that we've been driving in the marketplace and I think as I shared with you when I first joined nine months ago, even when I was doing my due diligence on Citrix a year ago, what I discovered was that there is a whole lot more to Citrix than the world knows about and in the last six months most importantly starting with the synergy in many, we have deliberately driven awareness to make sure that the world actually understands what we stand for and what we have to offer and the world actually understands that improving cybersecurity defenses is the most significant outcome that our customer gets from deploying Citrix solutions. So all combined, that\u2019s what we're seeing and that's why we amplify this and that's why it's going to be so important on a go forward basis. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kash Rangan","Is it linked to Microsoft Windows 10 and Server 2016, Kirill, curious to get your thoughts on how this opens up new opportunities for Citrix relative to the other OS releases we've had and certainly there's been cycles of desktop virtualization option in the past, I'm curious what are the new opportunities that open up for you in this cycle and also if you can just mention very briefly what is that you are specifically implementing in EMEA that we should expect better results from in 2017? Thank you very much. ","Kirill Tatarinov","I think Microsoft refresh cycle it would be fair to say that all of us expected Windows 10 adoption in the enterprise to go faster and I think most people took a bit of a pause and took a bit more time to do proof of concepts that [indiscernible] taking place into the spring, and now we're seeing adoption and now we're seeing broad adoption in enterprise and also that's what our friends at Microsoft are sharing with us.","And as in the past major Microsoft refresh cycles, Citrix gets to benefit. As I mentioned, some major, major clients are deploying Windows 10 through VDI mechanisms and that's tremendously helpful. We\u2019re now in the final phases to implement Windows 10 VDI on Azure which is coming in just next short few months and that will serve as additional catalyst, but certainly our partnership with Microsoft and overall rate of adoption of Windows 10 is strong and it's accelerating and we're really excited about it.","On Windows Server 2016 this is the best server release ever that Microsoft had and we're seeing good momentum and read analyst reports about Windows Server adoption sort of obviously in addition to all of the rapid move to deployed into Azure. Today majority of Windows Server runs on Windows Server 2008 so their major refresh cycle is coming and we believe that Windows Server 2016 will be right there and we will be right there with it since we have supported it from day one when it was released. ","Kash Rangan","And the EMEA steps, if you don't mind. Thank you. ","Kirill Tatarinov","On EMEA, I think it's a transformation on leadership where in the final phases of addressing a couple of open positions in Northern Europe in particular and we look forward to reporting on sort of upcoming leadership changes in that area and articulating strong results. I will say that just like in many other companies a lot of profile they are obvious microeconomic factors that I believe impacted our performance in that region.","I did have an opportunity to spend time in EMEA region past summer and had a chance to get introduced to the team and see where we're making strong progress that served us reassurance that in Central and Eastern Europe and in Germany we have strong leadership team and we have great execution and we know precisely what needs to do, we have the model that's working very well in the Americas. We\u2019re going to replicate it in EMEA and I think it represents good upside in my view. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Karl Keirstead","I\u2019ve got a couple for Dave, I will ask one at a time. David, on the margins up, I will call it 400 basis points year-over-year, you set your our core operating margin guide for 2017 higher than the prior guidance of 30%, so all good. I guess I'm asking how long this party can last type of question and may be the way I will phrase it is, how close we're to the point where perhaps driving growth acceleration becomes a little bit more important than showing margin upside. Thanks David. ","David Henshall","I say that at the beginning of the year we were talking a lot about restructuring and certain initiatives and we have transformed that over the last couple of quarters just into the way we run the business. We've got an ongoing focus on efficiencies in just getting better at everything we do and that will translate into two ways. One is the margin you see and then two is our ability to reinvest a lot of the savings if you will back into things that will drive growth. I would say that the team is much more focused on driving growth into the future than margins because we're building that muscle just kind of in the ongoing operations of the company.","As you mentioned, we\u2019re up better part of 800 basis points over two years. There is still a number of specific projects in flight those that have longer tail whether it's real estate related or procurement or those types of things that will continue to generate permanent savings. As we saw on our preliminary guidance for 2017 we do think that there's a lot more opportunity to run the business at even more efficient levels than we're today, we're going to keep driving those, but I also think that you will hear us talk much more about growth going forward because we're building a business around profitable growth and that's the focus of the execution. ","Karl Keirstead","And then maybe as my follow up, a balance sheet question, David your long term deferred revenue growth has been really solid last four quarters up 15%, 20% but in the third quarter just reported up 12% not a big deal but is there any story there that you can pass on to us around the long term DR [indiscernible]? ","David Henshall","No. No story. I think if you look at our deferred revenue profile over the last many years you tend to see Q2 and Q4 the quarters where it goes up, Q1 and Q3 it just kind of dips down it's just the cycle of the business. So I would expect that to pop pretty heavily in Q4 this year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steve Ashley","Dave I was going to follow up on the initial 2017 guidance realize it's -- I'm not going to call it preliminary but that is high level at this point. Do you have any color around what kind of expectations we might have for the product sectors of Workspace Services or Delivery Networking, how we might think about their growth rate in 2017? Thanks. ","David Henshall","Yes Steve, we're not going to guide at that level right now, but just to talk about that a little bit more. Everything that Kirill mentioned earlier in terms of the momentum around the Xen family business that's just pure execution and the other thing we've talked about is that there is an ongoing subscription component to that, the Citrix service provider business that I mentioned which is largely Xen family that\u2019s up to about $75 million ARR growing at 30%.","So we're addressing both more and more incremental efficiencies at the higher end of the market and also programs like CSP which are just net new largely targeting SMB in some mid-market. So it's coming from a number of different factors and we feel like that momentum can continue. In terms of networking, there is really three big segments of that business as everyone knows it's primarily around the secular trend towards cloud and e-commerce and SaaS providers, we're doing extremely well in that business and we will continue to expand the base.","The attach motion for today represent about 15% of the mix, that's been a function of what's been going on in the last five years around Workspace Services. So as that business accelerates, we will just have many more opportunities to go unattach and then turned around the part that we just term core enterprise ADC, that\u2019s probably our single biggest capacity add from a go to market standpoint in 2017. ","We've been ramping that up really last quarter and we will finish that up in Q4 timeframe, but at the end of next year we will probably have a 20% increase in networking capacity across the Board. So while it's largely a second half story, it's an area that we believe we can continue this trend of taking share each and every year. We just need to be involved in more places where our customers are. So that's just a little contextual flavor around the business, but in terms of overall guidance, just to reiterate, this year the core business is doing about 2.5%, 3% growth, our premium guidance for next year is to accelerate that to 3% to 4% and we think we can do that at a higher margin structure. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Heather Bellini ","I was just wondering if you could share with us how you're thinking about the opportunity changing for VDI. We've heard a lot about the price points due to hyper converged coming down over the last year or so enough and an uptick in demand as a result, I wanted to see how you see this trend reevolving if at all. Thanks. ","Kirill Tatarinov","We certainly see renewed energy from our customers and from our partners in the overall virtual cloud computing and that involves VDI, that involves XenApp and virtual app and frankly it also includes Xen mobile and it's sort of complete end to end end-user computing and device management. VDI is one segment that will be largely influenced by the refresh cycle of Windows 10 and we certainly see significant momentum and excitement building up there and we feel that we're going to be a strong beneficiaries of that trend. We do have strong partnerships with hyper converged appliance providers in particular Nutanix last quarter and now it's increased partnership with XenServer, they are putting XenServer in their appliances now and they are working with us on the entire VDI staff and on their appliance. It is primarily designed to serve mid-market which is obviously going to deploy to our strategy of continued expansion and mid-market customers and I view that as another net positive catalyst going forward. ","Heather Bellini","And just to follow up, thank you for that, any change in the competitive dynamics there? ","Kirill Tatarinov","Well I think the change is very profound and the change is very visible. We see it everywhere we go. With the strongest highly differentiated product and with dramatically improved competitive position in the marketplace, we see increased win rates. We see increased win rates in virtual client computing, we see increased win rates in networking and that served as a very tremendous positive catalyst for the way our people feel and the way our partners feel and frankly the way the industry feels about it and I think it's really the case where success breeds more success. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Gregg Moskowitz","David, your gross margin improved for the first time in a few quarters and all else equal, you'll get an additional lift next year without GoTo but as part of your guidance how are you thinking about overall gross margins in 2017? ","David Henshall","Yes. We haven't actually guided to gross margin yet for 2017. I think coming out of this quarter we will fill out the P&L, give you a little more granularity but just it's the same basic trends in Q3 that we've seen over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve talked for several years if you remember about a plateau somewhere around the mid-80s and that's materialized, I think that as the software based businesses continue to rebound and get stronger, that obviously provide some upward lift to margins at the same time. It will definitely be higher in 2017, but if you remember, even our SaaS properties today maintain pretty healthy gross margins. So stay tuned, talk more about it in three months. ","Gregg Moskowitz","And then for Kirill, in the UK I know it maybe a little difficult to parse just given some company specific factors that are at play but are you seeing any impact from Brexit? ","Kirill Tatarinov","I think we saw some impact in Q2 actually towards the end of the quarter. I would say that right now if there is some impact it's not material. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Abhey Lamba","I had a question on growth drivers in the Workspace's business. How are Microsoft products really helping your sales? Since customers on maintenance get upgraded for free, are you see mix improvement or more seats are attached [ph] for the products or is it kind of helping you attract new customers if you can just talk about that according to different Microsoft products that will be helpful. ","Kirill Tatarinov","I think it's across the Board, I would say predominantly its existing customers, expanding the usage this is really the case where unique capability in our support of Skype for Business and deploying those Skype for Business that is really see significant acceleration in particular in financial sector and we're working with these customers and since you have, we have unique technology, we obviously get to benefit from that and I would say that part of Microsoft relationship has been working incredibly well and we have been in unique position for at least a year now and it sounds like we\u2019re going to stay in that unique position for at least another six months if not more.","And of course, Windows 10 I think it's would be fair to say when you look at the worldwide deployment of Windows desktops, approximately if you kind of triangulate different analyst's reports, approximately 10% of those deployments run virtualized and obviously as those currently get to move to the new version of Windows, they typically go with the more recent and more advanced SKU of server of Citrix solutions and at the same time, they usually expand their usage and that's certainly something that we have started to see and we expect to see more of that as we go into 2017 which gives us increased confidence.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kirk Materne ","Just two quick ones, one or David and one for Kirill. David, I might've missed it when Kirill answered the question but I didn't catch the core margins for the business this quarter I assume there may be a couple 100 basis points ahead of the aggregate but I'm just wondering if you could give us any color on that and then Kirill, regarding some of your investment priorities as you head into fiscal 2017, can you just talk about if there is anything where you guys would want to make increase -- I know there is a big push around more direct sales on the networking side of this year, is there anything that stands out to you from an investment perspective as we head into next year? Thanks. ","David Henshall","Yes, Kirk the first part of the question on margin. We haven't done a full breakout P&L yet, we will complete that in the next month or so, but I know if the 30.3% for the consolidated business would be at least 31% for the core business. So historically it's been somewhere around 150 bips higher than the consolidated number. ","Kirill Tatarinov","Yes. On the investment side, obviously as David mentioned we're still in final stages of our 2017 planning but to give you our preliminary view, where we see investment priorities in go to market it is not only increasing direct selling capacity that we have been driving through most of 2016 and will continue in 2017, but it's also reinvigorating in many cases our partner channel and putting more energy and working with our partners. It served us well and we're now seeing early signals that\u2019s working to add more breadth into business and to expand in mid-market and we expect to do more of that. On the sort of product portfolio, if there is one most significant major transformation that is happening at Citrix right now, it is cloud transformation. We started it earlier this year. We have declared that we\u2019re all into cloud and we're absolutely going to continue and it is starting to serve us very well from awareness perspective, from the engagement perspective within our existing customers who all want to run their entire infrastructures in the cloud at some point in the future and for them to know that Citrix is going to be there with them serves as tremendous reassurance and we're going to continue to give them more proof points of how strong we\u2019re going to be going there and how we\u2019re going to become a leader in this emerging discipline of workspaces as a service.","And perhaps, sort of on couple additional major trends that we're embracing and that you're going to start seeing us sort of be central to, is workspaces [indiscernible]. This is overall Internet of Things taking place at people's workplace. It's really a scenario where if you imagine everything around you in your office now has certain amount of compute capacity and connected to the Internet and what magical things can you do there and Citrix being essentially workplace transformation company for the last 27 years has amazing DNA to essentially take advantage of this technological trend and give people the ability to help their people work better and work differently and we're already engaged with some of our partners and systems integrator community in particular, we\u2019re starting to see those scenarios and we\u2019re very engaged with some of our larger customers who are now turning into early adopters of those workplace IoT approaches.","So really exciting things happening in the industry and with Citrix being truly back on our innovation edge, we're very excited about being participant in that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Turits","Dave and Kirill two related questions or complementary questions on NetScaler. One, can you talk about how big HyperScale was as a percentage of the customer base in terms of dollars this quarter and what the outlook for that is? The second question is, how are customers deploying VPX in their public cloud deployment and do you see that is completely additive or cannibalistic at this point? ","David Henshall","I will take the first piece in terms of HyperScale, they would fall within that segment that we talk about as cloud infrastructure and e-commerce. It's 40% of the mix last quarter and then those what I would call HyperScale it's only a handful and that would represent a part of that market, the trend continues, the meta-trend around just capacity build out has been great. So that business whereas used to be one or two quarters per year has been strong for four or five quarters in a row now and that's one of the things that you see us lapsing really, really tough comps in Q3 and Q4 of last year.","Expect that to continue, we always have pretty good visibility on a full year basis, the quarter to quarter is somewhat subject to just the needs and capacity build out of the HyperScale. As we go into next year, as I mentioned a minute ago, part of the strategy is expanding that category so that you know you are touching what I'd call Tier 2 clouds as well as broader e-commerce providers and others as well as the capacity investments and attach motion for the other segments.","So that's what going on and overall networking. As far as VPX, remind everybody that the most important element of NetScaler is the fact that it's a software product. It's deployed across a number of form factors everything from fully virtualized data center appliances all the way down through virtual appliances and even in the form factor of a container and we get a lot of leverage by being able to utilize one code base across all those different use case scenarios.","So VPX on a license count was probably the fastest growing in Q3 and that's just a function of broad distribution. You can use that in the cloud, you can use that in your own data center, you can use that as part of a networking fabric if you will. And it's just having that base for us is what one of the things that we leverage from differentiation point of view. ","Kirill Tatarinov","I was just going to add one comment on the VPX. As David mentioned, our Citrix service provider segment is growing very, very nicely and we see -- while we don't break out individual elements of what Citrix service providers deliver, through their private partner cloud, we see the share of networking in that segment overall growing and that's all driven by VPX. So I would say in that respect it is additive. ","Michael Turits","Right. I guess my one build out on the VPX question is, are customers deploying it in public cloud and are they think about doing that versus adopting any load-balancing that can be offered by the public cloud vendors? ","Kirill Tatarinov","Yes Mike, I'm not sure we can make a generalization. There's not enough data. I will say that the fastest growing part of NetScaler is that being consumed as a service out of Amazon marketplace, Azure marketplace etcetera, so if that\u2019s specifically what you're asking about I'd say that we're definitely seeing that and part of the strategy around CPX obviously is to address the DevOps community for their upstream. You know when you're building applications before you deploy those into the cloud. So it's a little bit of both. It's still a small part of the overall business, but as I mentioned, it's probably the fastest growing element. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ed Maguire","I wanted to ask about the changing use scenarios around Office. Historically a lot of your customers have used -- have run office on XenApp but with the migration to Office 365 does this change how your customers are using the Xen platform? ","Kirill Tatarinov","We don't say material change on how they use Xen platform. The majority of our customers use office with office expansions. They continue to run those extensions virtualized, we see many customers running their -- essentially their exchange servers and Office 365 but we see lots of customers still preferring to use office deployed on their desktops and on their laptops and their devices which Office 365 allows and we will continue to see enterprise IT preferring to run those applications virtualized from either their own data centers or from essentially Citrix running at public cloud.","So I would say no material change, and I think overall Citrix and Microsoft working so closely together and Citrix being prime delivery mechanism of virtualized application from Azure, I see that as a neutral to positive shift as those customers go to more cloud deployments. ","David Henshall","Ed, I would just add one thing. If you think back your question from 10 or 20 years ago where remote access to email was the primary use case for a lot of customers, that's changed dramatically over the years and so when we look past some of the really pressing use cases like security and whatnot, workforce mobilization as a broader topic is actually really a big deal right now and that's not just thinking about one or two apps but the entire infrastructure that allows every worker regardless of where they reside to effectively be mobile and companies are doing that in pretty broadscale both from an engagement standpoint but probably more importantly from a real estate consolidation point of view and just ways to increase their density and immediately bring down costs. So that's just another phenomenon we're seeing. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brad Reback","David just real quickly on Capex for next year, should it be about $100 million given that the GoTo business has been running at about $50 million? ","David Henshall","Yes I think it's a good planning number at this point. I mean, again this is one of these things that once we get through the merger we will be able to talk about a lot more granularity, but a couple of statements I made earlier about cash flow and the fact that 80% to 90% of cash flow from ops come from the core business and I would just plan around those general assumptions at this point and then over the next three or four months we'll be able to dig into that a little bit more. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John DiFucci","David, question on Workspace Services. Was the CSP revenue -- I just want to make sure I understand this because you said that last quarter it grew 37% to $75 million in ARR. And then you said this quarter I think you said it grew 30% to $75 million I know this quarter those are round numbers. I guess can you just explain to us, is ARR the entire subscription run rate or is it new subscription because some people define it differently and was it flat quarter to quarter? Is that what you are saying? ","David Henshall","No. It is the entire subscription run rate for that business, that's the total revenue for that business and when we talk growth rates, I'm just measuring that on what the ARR was this year versus what it was last year.","John DiFucci","Okay that's clear. And then I guess, how much of that business then is new business signed in the quarter because you said it's the entire ARR? Can you tell us how much new business or new ARR was signed in the quarter or how much new revenue? Because if ARR was $75 million last quarter and that was $75 million this quarter, that would imply there is no new business signed this quarter which I would assume there is some. ","David Henshall","There definitely is. On a sequential basis and once we get the merger done and we're reporting on fewer moving parts, we'll dig in a little bit more on standardized ARR. Right now as I mentioned a couple of times, total recurring is only about $225 million of the base. So if you want to talk specifically about CSP, that product license revenue grew about 5.4% sequentially from Q2 to Q3. ","John DiFucci","Okay. Could you tell us about how much the revenue is from CSP in the quarter? ","David Henshall","Yes. It's 1\/4th of the ARR number that I have given. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Keith Weiss","I think the question for David, but as we think about 2017 and eCommerce that\u2019s going on in the cloud we see some of the growth parts of your business are coming from more and more subscription sources. Should we think about an increasing headwind on that license revenue line as we go into 2017 from shift towards more substantial license, is it amortizing off the balance sheet? ","David Henshall","No. Not in 2017. I think this is more a 2018 through 2020 story at this point in time do not expect it to have a material impact on the P&L. We have accounted for the modest uptake in our guidance and I think as we get into the second half of next year or maybe at our analyst meeting we can talk a lot more about how we look to accelerate those plan over the next several years, but not in the short term. ","Keith Weiss","And then for Kirill, definitely I want to talk about security this quarter, just want to go in for basis [ph], are we talking more about just a security use case for a poor set of products that are already good for executing on a security use case or is this a shift in terms of product [indiscernible] security more -- putting more security functionality and maybe to the ADC boxes or more discreet security functionality in terms of what you guys are delivering in Workspace Services that would require new functionality through M&A or organic development? ","Kirill Tatarinov","Well I think it is both. I would say most importantly it's emphasizing the benefits that we're already delivering and we have just been hiding it for lack of a better word being somewhat not as vocal explaining to people what benefits we already bring through our solutions, that's first I would stress and highlight and that\u2019s what you saw and we're actually seeing positive response from industry analysts when we explained what we were doing last month. The feedback was very positive and you may have seen some of written about it. I think the second is we've continuously driven innovation in this area across NetScaler in that family and ShareFile, addressing increasing needs of cybersecurity defenses in our existing customers and future customers. And of course, we continue to look to improve it and to do even more in the area of cybersecurity for our customers both organically and in organically as well.

Thanks for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. All of our key performance metrics came in at or above the targets we provided, and importantly, our subscription model transition accelerated. It's a great way to end what was a truly transformational year for Citrix.","Across the organization, we're aligning to drive acceleration of our subscription transition and sustained top line growth. Our value proposition to customers is that our solutions [abstract] the way of complexity and simplify how work gets done.","Similarly, we've eliminated complexities within our own organization to make it easier for our customers and our partners to do business with us. The foundational work that we've done and the changes we continue to fine tune support the exciting growth opportunities we see for Citrix in the years ahead.","Our history of leadership in desktop and app virtualization provides Citrix with a unique cornerstone within large enterprise customers. Customers around the world employ our virtualization products, many of whom also leverage Citrix networking solutions as a natural extension of the workspace, a key component of application performance.","That said, we believe our penetration in our existing customer base is only 25% or 30% of the available seats. We believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on our longer-term opportunity to both expand within our installed base and also to attract new customers.","The proliferation of applications, the top of mind criticality of security and the rapid expansion of mobile devices and cloud has set the stage for the need to adopt a unified and secure workspace. We believe Citrix is well positioned to help our customers maximize the productivity, the engagement and the satisfaction of their most valuable resources, their employees.","Within our Workspace business, we have an opportunity to dramatically expand our footprint within our current customer base, beyond those who require virtualization to really everyone within the organization.","We believe this concept will enable us to serve a substantially higher portion of enterprise knowledge workers. Not everyone requires the highest level of performance security and reliability that virtualization provides.","The construct of a dynamic, more general purpose workspace enables Citrix to become a ubiquitous utility, upon which even the lightest application users can benefit from the intelligence, automation and security that the Workspace provides.","For example, secure SaaS enables enterprises to support a growing number of SaaS applications while ensuring there's no data leakage. With single sign-on, enhanced security for SaaS apps, web filtering and analytics, Citrix Workspace helps our customers provide a more seamless experience that underpins improved employee engagement and productivity.","Longer term, the general purpose Workspace concept represents an opportunity for Citrix to reach a much broader customer base. It also provides a platform upon which our partners can deliver unique functionalities, specific to the needs of different vertical markets and enables us to provide a solution to every user on any platform anywhere in the world.","Dentons, the largest law firm in the world, is a great example of how Citrix helps customers simplify complexity and provide a great consistent user experience that helps drive productivity.","Following a series of acquisitions, Dentons now has around 16,000 employees globally, all of whom have to operate under the various rules, customs and regulations applicable to their locations.","Compounding this complexity is a need for flexibility in moving some of their offices entirely to the cloud, while other locations, with more legacy infrastructure, require the move to be at a more measured pace and others likely to remain in a hybrid environment for the foreseeable future.","This long standing customer chose Citrix Cloud services on Azure in partnership with Microsoft because we're the only ones that can provide a seamless, single and strategic solution to help alleviate this business complexity.","Similarly, American furniture retailer, Our House, is struggling with the fixed capacity and constraints of its on-premise infrastructure and needed to improve application performance without making big capital commitments.","Citrix Cloud is helping solve Our House's business and technical challenges by moving workloads between on-premise and cloud locations, enabling the scale-up of cloud resources as their business requirements change and preserving their flexibility to mix and match cloud infrastructure in the future.","In addition to the opportunity we have to increase Citrix's penetration within our customer base, the organizational changes we've made to accelerate the move to cloud in our subscription model increases our focus and improves our ability to attract new customers.","In fact, in the fourth quarter, total bookings from new customers to Citrix Cloud delivered strong growth, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. And the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud accelerated dramatically relative to Q3 and more than doubled from a year ago period.","For the full year, the number of new customers added to Citrix Cloud more than tripled. From a bookings perspective, the customers migrating to cloud continue to gain momentum, within the relatively early stages of moving our current installed base.","In 2018, less than third of our cloud bookings came from migrating installed base with the majority of bookings coming from either new seats or net new customers. This success is a direct result of a number of initiatives we executed in 2018, all of which are aligned against our broader initiatives.","First, with accelerating to the cloud, from product development and innovation to sales marketing and back-end supporting functions and infrastructure. We're now organized. We've made the transition to the cloud as a priority.","Second is we define our portfolio. Not only do we unify our product road map, but we've also simplified our messaging and our naming conventions that enable us to up-level conversations with our customers to the C-Suite. We continue to pivot our selling motion towards emphasizing the value of our complete solutions rather than just selling point products.","The third area is about expansion into new opportunities. In our Workspace business, we're moving from organizing work to really guiding and automating work. In networking, we're expanding our analytics capabilities to address the challenges inherent in complex, hybrid, multi-cloud environments.","We also executed a few technology tuck-in acquisitions, one for real-time Internet traffic management and another for intelligent consolidated access to Workspace activities and integrations with a number of business critical apps. These acquisitions accelerate our road map and demonstrate our commitment to making thoughtful, strategic investments in innovation.","However, growth in \u201818 was clearly driven by the Workspace, which delivered the fastest bookings growth since 2012, with product and subscription bookings up in the teens. I expect Workspace to continue to lead Citrix' growth as we progress through 2019.","Networking, of course, continues to be a cyclical industry with some secular trends that are worth noting. Today, a large majority of our networking revenue is being derived from hardware. While we continue to support our installed base, we're clearly putting the investments and our focus on the subscription software piece of our networking business.","The value of hardware revenue stream is very different from that of the higher-margin revenue generated by subscription software. And of course, at its heart, Citrix is a software company and increasingly, a subscription-based recurring revenue software company.","Our networking strategy is to focus investments in the faster growing software business. The future of networking, of course, is software and we're looking to position Citrix as the long-term beneficiary of this secular shift.","Consistent with this hardware related volatility, our SSP segment tends to be the most valuable part of the overall networking business. In Q4, SSP accounted for only about 15% of total networking bookings, down about 15% year-on-year. We continue to expect this to be the case in \u201819 due to the sporadic purchasing patterns of a handful of hyperscale customers.","That said, we're confident in the longer-term growth opportunities within networking software. We're positioning Citrix to benefit from the evolution of network architectures from monoliths to microservices and across platforms with hybrid, multi-cloud environments. This is an opportunity for Citrix to provide platform-agnostic flexibility, performance and a consistent experience, regardless of where applications reside.","These opportunities in both our Workspace and networking businesses, combined with our increased investments we're making in product development, marketing, demand generation and our growing number of quota-carrying reps and channel partners, gives me the confidence in our outlook for the years ahead.","Today, I believe we have the best product portfolio we've ever had. We're solving real, complex customer challenges, and we're focusing on customer experience and customer success in a holistic way to drive better outcomes for our customers, and of course, for Citrix.","Our strategic partnership with Microsoft is stronger than ever, and we continue to collaborate in development and go to market and benefit from the great symbiotic relationship. And we continue to deliver both strong financial results and innovation while driving continued progress in our subscription model transition.","With that, let me turn it over to Drew to review our financials and guidance in more detail. Drew?","Andrew Del Matto","Thank you, David. And thank you all for joining our call this afternoon. As David mentioned, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with our model transition progressing ahead of plan.","Our subscription mix accelerated to over 50% of product bookings in the quarter, up from 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. The full year subscription bookings accounted for 42% of total product bookings.","As we enter the next phase of our subscription model transition, we know it would be helpful for you to better understand the components of our subscription revenue. So we'd like to provide more transparency into the SaaS portion of our subscription revenue. This will make it easier for you to track the progress of our Citrix Cloud revenue stream over time.","Internally, we continue to prioritize SaaS, which has grown to more than $270 million in 2018, which was approximately 50% of our subscription revenue and growing faster than total subscription revenue. In the fourth quarter, SaaS revenue grew to $78 million, nearly 10% of total revenue.","Going forward, we believe SaaS revenue will be one of the most important measures of the evolution of our business model and an important KPI for the progression of our subscription transition. As such, we plan to provide the SaaS component within the subscription revenue on an ongoing basis, beginning in the first quarter of 2019.","Importantly, this will also serve to isolate the variability that comes from the parts of the subscription revenue that are more susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. For example, the on-premise churn and transaction elements within subscription revenue are subject to seasonally softer periods like the first quarter.","[With mobile] business migrating to the higher-value recurring revenue stream associated with a subscription model, more of our business booked in the current period will be recognized in future periods. This could be monitored in the data provided on our future committed revenue or deferred and unbilled revenue as seen on our supplemental disclosures.","Our future committed revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Please note that the adoption of revenue accounting standard ASC 606 creates an approximate 200 basis point headwind to our fourth quarter 2018 deferred and unbilled revenue compared to that of the fourth quarter of 2017.","In the fourth quarter, revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, driven by subscription revenue growth of 45% from the year-ago period, which accelerated from the third quarter. It's important to note - to highlight that the subscription model transition had a dampening effect on the fourth quarter reported revenue of approximately 150 to 200 basis points.","Workspace revenue of $557 million increased 6% from the year ago period and increased 6% for the full year. Workspace subscription revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter. In fact, year-over-year, Workspace subscription revenue increased more than 30% in every quarter during 2018.","We continue to be very pleased with the underlying strength of the Workspace business. Our leadership and vision in Workspace, as David described, is clearly resonating with customers. As Citrix Cloud offering and ability to support hybrid cloud environments, it's helping us both expand within our existing customer base and attract new customers to the Citrix platform.","In the fourth quarter, subscriptions accounted for over 60% of Workspace product bookings versus 42% in the year ago period and 57% in the prior quarter. We are tracking well ahead of our original transition milestone in this business.","Within Workspace, content collaboration revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. Please keep in mind that this was the final quarter in which we will separately break out revenue for the ShareFile business.","As discussed on prior calls, this business has evolved to more of an integrated file, sync and sharing solution for our enterprise customers as opposed to primarily addressing the stand-alone SMB space. As such, content collaboration results are now integrated into our Workspace business.","Networking revenue of $206 million declined 4% year-over-year, due to large part to the cyclical ordering patterns at the large hyperscale providers. In fact, the decline in the SSP business negatively impacted networking revenue by approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the year ago period.","Despite this SSP headwind, we were able to achieve both top and bottom line expectations. For the full year, total networking revenue increased 3% compared to the full year of 2017 and increased from 4% to 9% of the total.","Looking ahead, as the mix within our networking business transitions away from hardware, it will create pressure on reported revenue. As we progress through this mix shift transition, the growth of networking subscription revenue will be a more meaningful reflection of the underlying performance of this business.","In the fourth quarter, networking subscription revenue more than doubled year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That said, we are earlier in the transformation of our networking business to the subscription model relative to the transformation of our Workspace business.","The momentum of our business remains strong, particularly considering the 150 to 200 basis point subscription revenue mix headwind as well as the previously noted $20 million SSP headwind. We continue to be pleased with the underlying growth of our core software business in the mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis.","Turning to the geographies. Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter grew more than 40% year-over-year in the Americas and in EMEA and it nearly doubled year-over-year in APJ.","For the full year, revenue in the Americas accounted for 58% of total revenue, EMEA accounted for 32% and APJ accounted for 10% of the total revenue for the full year.","Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 35% and was 32% for the full year, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Recall that adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by the restructuring actions we took in October of that year to realign the organization to better support our subscription model transition and enable us to more aggressively invest in innovation.","The lag between the time of the restructuring and the time it takes to grab thoughtful and disciplined investments in the business explains the variation in adjusted operating margin relative to the year ago period for the quarter and for the year.","Looking ahead, we will continue [balance] expanding profitability with investments to improve our long-term sustainable growth trajectory. In the quarter, cash flow from operations was approximately $206 million and down from the year ago period. This year-over-year decline reflects the impact of the timing of the cash collections as a result of our subscription model transition.","As a consequence of the rapid subscription model ramp [ph] more revenue and more cash flow will be recognized and collected in future periods. The primary offset of this is unbilled revenue, which increased over 300% during FY \u201818 to over $325 million. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $135 billion [ph], up 7% from 2017. We expect full year cash flow from operations to continue to grow year-over-year in 2019.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and investments. During Q4, we repurchased approximately $380 million of shares, thereby completing our $2 billion share repurchase commitment announced in November of 2017. We currently have $770 million of share repurchase authorization remaining.","In the fourth quarter, we also paid our first quarterly dividend, returning an additional $47 million to shareholders following our Board of Directors $0.35 per share dividend declaration.","As mentioned on today's earnings release, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid later this quarter.","Now turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, consistent with our multiyear strategy, we expect continued momentum in the adoption of our cloud services. We are reiterating our full year 2019 guidance, which includes, revenue between $3.08 billion and $3.09 billion, adjusted operating margin of 31.5% to 32% and adjusted EPS of approximately $6.","This guidance reflects our belief that subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will increase from just over 40% last year to as much as 55% in 2019. This mix shift creates a revenue headwind of between 150 and 200 basis points during the year. This guidance also contemplates a headwind from networking hardware.","The timing of this networking hardware headwind is the primary driver of our first quarter guidance. We currently anticipate revenue between $700 million and $710 million, adjusted EPS of approximately $1.15 to $1.20.","To provide some context with regard to the quarterly progression through the course of 2019, please keep in mind that the first quarter is always the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for Citrix. However, we expect strong Workspace growth in the quarter, primarily driven by Citrix Cloud subscriptions.","Given the visibility of the timing of the networking hardware orders into a concentrated number of hyperscale customers, we expect the headwind to the first quarter of revenue to be more pronounced. As mentioned, orders from these customers are volatile.","While it's helpful to look at the historical seasonality of our results for the ramp in margins and the EPS throughout the year, it is important to note that 2018 results were positively impacted by our 2017 restructuring and the adoption of ASC 606.","As mentioned earlier, operating expenses from the first half of 2018 benefited from the restructuring actions taken toward the end of 2017 and reflect the lag in time it takes to reinvest in the business.","As such, in the first quarter, you should expect to see bookings revenue, adjusted margin and EPS at the lowest point of the year. In other words, 2019 operating margin expansion and EPS growth will be weighted towards the second half of the year due to normal seasonality, our continued shift to subscription revenue and our recent investments in building sales capacity.","With that, I'd like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. David, 2018 was a really good year for Citrix. The transition seems to be coming about nicely. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit, just looking at your 2020 free cash flow target and where you just came in for 2018, which was pretty close to that. Can you give us an update on how you are thinking about the 2020 target and potentially 2022 based on where you currently are? Thank you.","David Henshall","You bet. Just to remind everybody, we - about a year ago, when we laid out our multiyear plan, we put a target for 2020 at $7 per share of free cash flow. Clearly, as Heather pointed out, '18 was a really strong year. Our overperformance led us to the point where we're nearly there already looking backwards. So we're going to exceed that target in 2019, usually a year ahead of that plan.","This is despite all the current headwinds from the success we're having in transitioning the business. [Technical Difficulty] well ahead of our original plan, at least a year ahead at this point.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you very much.","David Henshall","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Philip Winslow","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. You guys had a great [ph] closer year. David, just want to focus on Workspace Services. If you look at sort of just your numbers this year, that's been really the area of upside. You talked about, I think, the best growth since 2012, and then Drew even talked about sort of leaving expectation for potentially continuing in the mid to high single-digit growth there.","I guess, sort of what's changed that we're returning back to those sort of 12, 12 growth rate levels and sort of that - the forward comps and grow it as a product. Is it the pricing side? Is it called just unit growth? I mean, just maybe kind of help me through the puts and takes there.","David Henshall","You bet, Phil. So yes, just to remind everybody, what we talked about the call, I mean, Workspace as our largest business. Let's add bookings growth in the double digits, and that's been accelerating over the last couple of years. So we're really happy with where we are, and we expect double-digit performance again in 2019.","So what's happening is that, overall, we've just laid out a really compelling vision for customers. And we've been able to articulate not just incremental value around the Workspace for how we're organizing work and we're helping secure and manage a lot of their applications, bringing together content into really a clean, simple solution. But we've articulated this vision now for what I described in the prepared remarks as really general purpose.","And so what that means in simple terms is that we're adding value to non-virtualized use cases as well. So now we've got a full package of the Workspace that could be applicable to every user in every enterprise, not just at current 30% that today is using virtualization, but more of a ubiquitous platform that allows us to go wall to wall. And as we're successful driving that penetration, we can add a lot of incremental value with new engagements and new solutions on top of that for customers.","So it's a combination of more focused and direct selling. Our sales teams did a great job in 2018, the best products that we've ever had and I think the most compelling vision, both for virtualization capabilities and now outside, and that's what's driving that business recovery overall.","Philip Winslow","Got it. Thanks. And also just, David, on the go-to-market, wondering if you can comment there because obviously, the margin's been strong this year if you look at just sort of the sales and marketing to the product ratio. And just the bookings ratios, it looks like you've had good productivity. Similar thing, what's driving that? How do you think sort of sales productivity as you enter \u201819 here?","David Henshall","Yes, Phil. Overall, we - as part of our overall transformation, as people remember, we're moving from being a, what I would describe as more of a project-based or bottoms-ups sale to much more of a strategic top-down sale, engaging with a C-level. That's of the motion we've been driving our field organization over the course of the last 18 months. Along with that, we're able to do larger transaction size.","So we closed a record number of $1 million plus deals last year, over 300 of them, a record number of 8 figure deals and also, the largest transaction in the company's history. And so all that is just really the result of all of these individual steps we've been taking along the way. Because of that, we're actually getting better productivity.","The second reason we're getting better productivity is as part of the transformation, we've simplified the story. We've simplified exactly the message and the value prop we're bringing for our customers. And we've simplified our product portfolio, frankly, and removed the non-strategic elements that just weren't adding value.","Philip Winslow","Thanks, guys. Congrats.","David Henshall","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Can I start on the networking side? Obviously, like the issues with the big service providers and with the Internet service providers has been going on for a while. What gives you the confidence like that would, at some point, resolve during the year? Obviously, there has been other guys that kind of sell into that spending area, have been kind of being somewhat cautious about that in 2019. Can you just talk a little bit towards that? Thank you.","David Henshall","Sure, Raimo. So let me put a little context around that. So if everyone recalls, a minute ago, we reiterated our full year guidance, but we shifted Q1 to account for the timing of SSP hardware. That's really the only volatile part of our business because Workspace is kind of rocking up into the right at this point in time.","And so when we engage with a hyperscale, we generally have a demand intent for the full year. So we have a pretty good understanding of what their capital requirements are going to be for a full year period of time. And it just becomes a little harder to predict the exact quarters in which those will fall. We just happen to know, Q1 in particular is not a large concentration of purchases for that small group of customers. So we understand the full year.","But what I'd say about overall demand in that segment is that the SSPs have been declining in the aggregate for about 3 years now. They're down in the low double digits, and we are seeing the DaaS [ph] going to phase in 2019. That's been in our plan in our guidance as well. So we're pretty much spot on in '18 from our expectation.","Directionally, it's a combination of their infrastructure just becoming more efficient over time, combination of more of those capabilities moving towards software. So it's a kind of combination of those two dynamics but contemplated on our plan and our outlook.","Raimo Lenschow","Okay, perfect. And then the - I don't know if I missed that, but could you talk to about the Citrix service provider program? Like I know like you too - I think you wanted to give us more detail, but I'm not quite sure how much more I got from you. So ShareFile, you gave me a number for the last time. Could you talk about the service provider program, please?","David Henshall","Well, Raimo, let me take that question and kind of frame it a little bit because what's really important here is the subscription line of revenue. That's the line where it's reflecting the more ratable elements of our business. And so remind everybody that, as we've discussed on prior calls, our subscription revenue includes three components: SaaS revenue, which is from Citrix Cloud, that's the largest and fastest-growing component, second is the transactional revenue from CSPs, which continues to grow nicely, and then term licenses or on-prem license sales. Think of that as kind of a bridge to the cloud.","And so what we're doing going forward is we're breaking those out so that everyone can see with more clarity exactly what's going on in the SaaS part of the business. That is most reflective of our actual strategic evolution, and that removes some of the noise that happens quarter-to-quarter with consumption-based programs like CSP and term licenses that have a little bit of an accounting adjustment that influences their recognition. Those tend to frankly be more seasonal in nature. So that's why we're isolating that.","And I'd encourage you to go back and look at our presentation that we laid out because we gave all of the historical quarters for 2019 and allow you to model that really effectively going forward.","Raimo Lenschow","All right. I appreciate that. Thank you.","David Henshall","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Mark, please check your mute button.","Mark Moerdler","I apologize. I was on mute. Trying to keep quite, okay. The move from hardware to subscription and networking is obviously a headwind to revenue, I think, you said about $20 million. But the margin of subscription should be higher in the networking business. Can you give us a sense of how much of a tailwind to margin this has been and how we should think about its impact on margins going forward? Then I got a follow-up.","David Henshall","Sure, Mark. I mean, Mark, if you think about the overall dynamics, I mean, it's clear to everyone that as application architecture has changed and where applications are being run, whether those are on-premise or the cloud, the networking industry is changing, more and more value is going to be delivered via software. That's why our solution has always been to approach networking as more of a hybrid multi-cloud. So really, what that means is we've got a software-based solution that can be deployed in the form factor of an appliance, virtual appliance, in a container, et cetera.","And what we're seeing from our customers is more and more of those purchases are coming from the software form. That's really a reflection of the hybrid multi-cloud phenomenon.","For us, when we talk about margins, in the aggregate, across the company, margin has a little bit of a pressure for - but there's two dynamic going on. So you'll see margins coming down a little bit. The reason they're coming down is because we're moving from extremely high-margin software business on a perpetual basis to cloud. That's really kind of function number one. That's offset, as you pointed out, by less hardware and more software on the networking side.","So those actually helps and provides a tailwind. But in the aggregate, in general, the bigger shift is the one from on-prem to cloud. And so I think you should expect to see some gradual pressure on gross margin over the next several years as we drive the success of that transition.","Mark Moerdler","That's helpful. And as a follow-up, long-term deferred used to be increasing at a slower rate than previously. Maybe I missed out in all the data you gave us. But is there a billings duration decrease occurring or is there Citrix issue? How should we think about that?","David Henshall","Mark, what's going on is really the transition from our prior model to our new model. And so what we've been talking about all along is more - less about deferred revenue and much more about unbilled revenue. So everybody is clear, our typical Citrix Cloud contract is a 3 year contractual commitment with annual billings, and that's why we're looking at this huge growth in unbilled revenue.","Historically, we would have billed all that upfront. But in the new model, it's much more of this combination of unbilled and deferred. So when Drew talks about future committed revenue, that's the number he is referring to. That's the number that was up about 12% year-on-year. It now sits at nearly $2.2 billion, and that's the one to keep an eye on.","And I think when you add that change to our reported revenue, that gives you a very good approximation of the underlying bookings growth in the company. So that's more of how the business is progressing. Just to do the math for you, that shows that the underlying business is growing in the mid to high single-digit range.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Two questions. First, just maybe a quick one on the networking type, following up on Raimo's question. As we look at the growth maybe for the full year that you're expecting, I think you grew about 3% in '18. Are you still expecting growth in aggregate in your guide in that networking business?","David Henshall","To be determined on the hardware piece, how quickly that goes. We're certainly looking for growth in bookings, in overall bookings on the networking business. The question is how much shows up as subscription versus hardware. If that dynamic changes materially, then we'll come back and talk about that with the benefit of hindsight.","Walter Pritchard","Great. And then just David, on the subscription in Workspace, could you help us understand how - customer usage? You talked about kind of the term licenses or sort of an intermediate step [ph] to cloud, and then Citrix Cloud has a number of value propositions. Where are customers in terms of recognizing the sort of different stage of value propositions around ultimately adopting and consuming Citrix Cloud?","David Henshall","Well, the value prop around Citrix Cloud is changing pretty rapidly. I'd say a year ago most customers were looking at Citrix Cloud as a hosted control plane to simplify the management of their on-premise virtualization. And honestly, that proposition wasn't that compelling. I mean, it sounded expensive to a lot of customers.","Fast-forward throughout 2018, and we have articulated a much broader story, and in fact, there's over a dozen services live as part of Citrix Cloud to be able to optimize on premise, should they want that. But more importantly, so much net new functionality, whether we're talking about analytics or unified endpoint management or content collaboration or secure SaaS application and all these other solutions inside the Workspace.","So that's one of the reasons why at the end of the year, our trade-up motion has started to really uptick, but I expect that to be a strong motion throughout '19. So that entire value proposition is really changing. So the customers that are adopting right now are not doing it to simplify an old virtualization deployment.","Frankly, we're encouraging them to leave that as is. This is really about that broad general-purpose expansion that I referenced earlier. How do we go much broader and deeper in those accounts? And then over time, as they move their workloads, the virtualization workloads to the cloud, then we can provide a lot of incremental value on top of that. But I look at that honestly as a Phase 2.","Walter Pritchard","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Karl Keirstead","Thanks. Hey, Drew. Could we go back to the progression of the total revenue growth rate throughout the first - throughout the year? Obviously, we're starting Q1 at roughly 1% growth given your guide, and you mentioned, in the full year, it will be 4%. So it needs to accelerate in quarters 2 through 4. But it sounds like the primary headwinds, the subscription transition and these NetScaler issues, are likely to persist throughout the year.","So I'm just wondering if you could pinpoint the key growth drivers because your compares actually get modestly tougher, actually, in the next two quarters? Thank you. And I've got a follow-up.","Andrew Del Matto","Sure. Sure, Carl. It's really the timing of the SSP, the timing of the SSP orders, how they come in. And again, that's been a very cyclical business. And then the second thing is really just the ramp on the subscription, yes, the recognition of all the bookings, how that - how they get recognize this exactly.","Karl Keirstead","Okay, got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question is just on the geo performance. Americas has done really well over the last, I think, 3 or 4 quarters, up 6% to 8%. I think it was negative 1% in the quarter just reported.","And I'm just wondering if you could put your finger on what might have caused the decel on the Americas side. Maybe it was more heavily skewed to this SSP NetScaler issue, but maybe if there's anything else going on. Thank you.","Andrew Del Matto","That's it. You have it, Carl, with SSP.","Karl Keirstead","Okay. Got it. Thank you, both.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sanjit Singh","Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the questions and I kind of want to follow up on the 2020 target that Heather alluded to earlier in the call. I think one of the targets out there was around subscription revenue being around 40% of revenue, and we're at - we're sort of standing at 16% today.","So I wanted to better understand whether that was still the target going into 2020 and what that progression could look like from 16% to 40%? And I had a follow-up, if you don't mind.","David Henshall","Sure. Let me answer [ph] pretty quickly. As you saw, we went from 10 to 15. We haven't started to move the installed base yet. So that's really what's going to drive the more substantial uptick.","Net new customers, net new seats, that business is humming [ph]. We've talked a lot about that. That's what's driving a lot of the unbilled and deferred. But the trade-up program from installed base, right now, we're less than 10% of the installed base looking back a year or so. So as we put more focus on that in 2019, that will provide some incremental tailwinds there.","So I'd say we're directionally on track to where we'd like to be at this point. We're a little bit ahead from a bookings mix standpoint, and that will translate into recognized revenue as we go forward.","Sanjit Singh","Got it. That's very helpful. And then in terms of looking at - we've had a couple of quarters, actually, several quarters of the subscription transition. Do you have any sense of how the renewal rate on subscription sort of compare to historical renewal rates on maintenance? Are we looking at sort of a 90%-plus rate or is it sort of more in line with traditional maintenance? Any sort of characterization there would be helpful.","David Henshall","Not a lot of data points to really call out a trend yet. Mostly, it's 3 year commitments. But I will say that a lot of the investments we've been making over the last few quarters, and we will in \u201819, is around the customer success teams and those that really work hand in glove with customers to make sure that they're driving adoption, first off.","And second, there are driving value out of the solutions they've purchased. That also positions us, as you'd imagine, much more cleanly to be able to layer in incremental new revenue streams as we introduce new capabilities.","Sanjit Singh","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is open.","John DiFucci","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question has to do with this transition to subscription. And I guess, I'm just a little confused because I mean, to me, I don't think that's new. I mean, that's something you've been talking about. That's something we've been seeing anyway in the market.","And I guess, like - Drew, you gave us some like headwinds because of that. And I just - I guess, I want to understand - I appreciate that you're giving us that. But is there something else too that's happening, like you did talk about the large hyperscale customers. And we understand that, that's been happening for a long, long time too, and we understand that, that can cause some volatility. But it's not nearly the volatility that it used to be, as far as what we used to see in that business.","So I'm just - there's a lot of questions around this, especially this next quarter's guidance relative to what's happening for the year. And I just - I don't know, it just seems like there's something else going on here. I just want to make sure we're not missing something.","David Henshall","To understand - but I'm not sure what you're looking for actually. There is really only two things going on. We've moved from up to 42% of new bookings coming from subscription or 30%, 30-ish or probably even a year before, mid-20s and then much lower 2 years earlier.","And so Drew talked about the incremental headwind that comes from moving from 40% last year to 55-plus this year. Couple of hundred basis point headwind on revenue growth, incremental to where we were. And then it's just a matter of the networking business as we referred to, SSP a little bit lumpy. And then gradually, over time, hardware shifts into software. There's not really a dynamic.","I think the easiest way to understand economically the change in our business is look at the change in deferred and unbilled right next to the recognized revenue numbers. It's probably the best way to just measure how many economic dollars are coming in.","John DiFucci","Yes. But David, with the deferred and unbilled, and I appreciate that. And you're not the only company that's saying to look at that. But frankly, depending upon the duration of the contracts and if that were to change, things like that, it's - and without a lot of historical information, it's really hard to just place our faith in that number right now.","But I guess, my question, it has more to do with -- you gave guidance and you had given us an idea of guidance after the last quarter for next year too. And it sounds like you're sort of maintaining that, which is good to see. But at the same time, with the first quarter being a little bit lighter than at least we had, I - obviously, you hadn't given guidance for that and not raising that. I'm just trying to - I just want to make sure that we're not missing something. So you didn't lower guidance for the year. I get that, that's good. And I guess, you just feel like the same way you felt about the business when you gave guidance last quarter. This is kind of what I'm trying to get to.","And I'm sorry for rambling there, but I'm just trying to - I - there's a lot of information about what headwinds were happening, but those headwinds aren't new. You've been doing that. That's what you planned for, I believe. Unless sales were incremental headwinds to that, you just didn't expect to transition to subscription, but I don't think that's right, right?","David Henshall","I'm not sure if that's a statement or a question, but...","John DiFucci","It's a question.","David Henshall","I'm not sure where this skepticism comes on deferred and unbilled. I'll tell you, our standard cloud contract is simply 3 year commitment, annual billings. I mean, that's what we go with, and we - that is the vast majority of contracts. So I'm not sure what that...","John DiFucci","But that standard has changed. That's changed over time, and it could change for any company. And given what we do - and with all due respect, David, you're very straightforward. You always have been. I appreciate that. But given what we do, we know that could change at any time and it often does. It has for you over the years too. And that's where that skepticism - and it doesn't - just for Citrix. I mean, that - I'm skeptical about that for any company. I think everybody should be. But I don't know. We could talk about that offline. I don't want to go into that too much.","David Henshall","Yes, probably a better topic offline. But I mean, I'll tell you the way that I'm looking at the business from a top-down standpoint is one of the dollars that customers were committing to and one of the value they're driving from our solutions is how does that compare with the year prior.","So internally, our focus is entirely on product and subscription. That's the direction we're driving the business. We thought that giving more granularity in the subscription line is the easiest way to have the transparency into that because like you said, there's occasionally noise in contracts like on the prem firm.","And so we'll just give you the details so you can look for it. And if there's follow-up questions, then let's take those offline.","John DiFucci","Okay. Thanks a lot, David. Thanks, Drew.","David Henshall","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Nikolay Beliov","Hi. David, question for you. Microsoft seems poised to launch Windows desktop virtual surveys on top of Azure. How is it changing your relationship with Microsoft? And could [ph] at some point, customers begin to foresee it [ph] best services and alternatives to Citrix rather than complement to Citrix?","David Henshall","I think the way everybody needs to think about Azure Virtual Desktop, which is the name of the platform, I mean, that is analogous to Windows Server platform when it comes to our business. That's the way to think about it. And then for the last 25 years, our products, our virtualization products that is, have embraced and extended the Windows Server platform.","As Windows becomes subsumed by Azure, we now embrace and extend the Azure Virtual Desktop platform. It's the exact same analogy to where we've been over time. So I think it's fair to say that, that platform always gets higher functionality as time goes by. That hasn't changed in decades now.","And so our strategy is always for that part of the business to embrace and extend. And we work with Microsoft on a collaborative basis for new initiatives like Desktop as a Service. We're the only vendor that is going to be announcing - well, has announced and going to be delivering a native DaaS service on top of Azure where we can bundle Azure capacity and sell that as one turnkey solution.","I think that's a - right now, that is not a large part of the overall market, but we recognize that there are use cases where that is an important solution to have. That's why we're building those together.","So overall, I mean, we're working very collaboratively with them, both on the development side and on the go-to-market side and we'll continue to, not just in virtualization, of course, but in areas like virtual WAN and mobility and many others.","Nikolay Beliov","As a follow-up, coming out of the Partners Summit a couple of weeks ago, what was the feedback from partners generally speaking? And what is the focus around incentives with partners this year 2019? Thank you.","David Henshall","Yes. I'd say it was - as somebody who's been to the last 17 Summits, it's been - it was one of our best ever. I mean, I'd say that the alignment across the go-to-market teams, both partners and Citrix badged, is as high as it's ever been, and the enthusiasm is good because they were successful in '18.","The incentive changes that we made with partners are modest. Last year, in '18, we made pretty material changes to move them away from traditional models where they get paid to renew maintenance and things like that, really towards net new product, net new subscription.","And so the next phase of that, that we introduce in \u201819 is starting to put more incentive around actual usage of those cloud solutions because it's really critical that customers see success in their purchases. So now one of the steps is to continue to drive active daily use of those products. And so as customers are successful, then the partner gets an additional incentive on the back end of that. That's more of just continuous engagement overall.","We took them through a lot of this very similar messaging and then other content which was under NDA but really talking about this new broad market opportunity that exists by the extended general purpose Workspace, where we give them detailed road maps of where we're going on the intelligent Workspace. And that just gives them a lot more flavor for how the TAM is going to double over time and how we're moving into really higher-growth market opportunities.","Nikolay Beliov","Thanks for the color, David. I appreciate it.","David Henshall","Thanks, Nikolay.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. David, maybe just actually another one come off the back of your Partners Summit. Obviously, lots of people concerned about maintaining economic conditions in places like Europe and Asia Pac and given that type of pretty broad curve yields in those regions. Anything changing from your perspective, from a macro perspective? Or the secular trends are powering over any macro noise in your view right now?","David Henshall","I think noise is a right way to put it. I mean, it is a headwind. So if you look at it specifically, we've been a public sector business, state and local or much larger parts for Citrix than federal. But I think it's reasonably to us - reasonable to assume that there's going to be some broader impact at some point. I mean, I can't point to it quantitatively.","But qualitatively, there's conversations that everyone's having, just trying to understand the potential impact on their business, whether it's from U.S. shutdown, whether it's from global changes with Brexit or whether it's things like ongoing political volatility.","So there is conversations out there, but we're anticipating that conditions in \u201819 are roughly similar to what we saw in Q4 time frame when this was already a pretty hot topic.","Kirk Materne","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just actually on the Windows Virtual Desktop. I think the plan is to now launch in the spring. Imagine having that much sort of launch activity around it. It's obviously a positive thing for you all.","I guess, any chance though that - as customers - to sort of evaluate it and understand better how you guys sort of, to your point, extend the technology. Any concern you have on that, that could actually be a pausing [ph] function for folks? Or do you think there's - you've done off round [ph] to go to market to feel good about sort of the joint marketing effort around it that should change buying decisions or anything like that?","David Henshall","Well, I think this is the move we've been in many, many times over the years whenever any new platform comes out. And so one of the things that we did at our partner kick-off a couple of weeks ago was have a senior Microsoft executive on stage with our teams really talking about the joint solution and the fact that our enterprise customers, the typical people that we sell to, really needs Citrix capabilities.","And that's why we go in and we do these things together because Citrix is successful. We bring through a lot of Azure capabilities. We bring through O365. We bring through lots of others. So it's a very symbiotic relationship, and we've been spending a lot of time together as organizations in the field talking about that dynamic.","Kirk Materne","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, David.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open.","Brad Reback","Great. Thanks very much. David, last quarter, you talked about the expectation of having a record quarter of large deals in 4Q. Was that the case?","David Henshall","Yes.","Brad Reback","And I don't think you guys provided the number of $1 million deals this quarter. Could you give us that?","Andrew Del Matto","Yes. On top of my head, I think it was 125. We have to follow up with you to confirm that number. Sounds right, but we'll just follow up.","Brad Reback","Okay. Thank you very much.","Andrew Del Matto","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Rob Majek","This is actually Rob Majek for Michael today. I know it's early, but how was - how has feedback been going so far on the offering you originally launched to help MSP deliver SD-WAN to their customers?","David Henshall","Yes, we've been talking about SD-WAN much. I mean, It's a small part of the business, but it's growing. And to your point, we've done a couple of things on that, that are focused on kind of creating and expanding the new MSP channel, which is it's early. It's starting to get traction.","We've done some things with our channel programs, and we've done a few things like with Microsoft where we were basically their - the preferred virtual WAN provider on Azure.","And so I think that market is evolving in a fairly interesting way. I mean, really, right now, the types of deployments that we're seeing from customers are really focused on optimizing SaaS performance, enhancing a lot of the delivery, resiliency and performance of things like Office 365 and those types of capabilities. And I think that's where that market evolves as well.","Rob Majek","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for question and answers. I will now turn the call back over to David Henshall, President and CEO for closing comments.","David Henshall","Thanks, again, everyone, for joining us this evening. Let me just leave you with a few final takeaways. Clearly, the fourth quarter results cap off a really important year for our overall transformation. We exceeded expectations across all metrics despite some of the cyclical headwinds in networking, hardware, the areas that we've talked about.","Our subscription model transition is accelerating, as we've said, as evidenced by subscription revenue at 45% in Q4, the fact that unbilled and deferred revenue is up well over $200 million year-on-year and the other metrics that are supporting that overall.","So clearly, we're excited about the opportunity to drive growth in the years ahead. Capitalizing on the opportunity to further penetrate both our existing installed base as well as really using the general purpose Workspace concept to attract net new customers, net new opportunities looking forward.","So we'll come back in 3 months, provide you with an update on those initiatives. Everybody have a good night, and talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's Citrix conference call. You may disconnect."],"5523":["Citrix Systems, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Ms. Tsuchiguchi, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Traci Tsuchiguchi","Thank you, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's second quarter and fiscal year 2019 earnings call. Participating on this call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jessica Soisson, Interim Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that we have posted our second quarter earnings letter to our investor relations website. ","I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the US securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.","Additional information concerning these and other factors are highlighted in today's earnings letter and in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on our Investor Relations website.","Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of our earnings letter found on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to David, our President and Chief Executive Officer. David?","David Henshall","Thanks, Traci. And good afternoon. Thanks for everybody for joining the call. I hope everybody had an opportunity to review the earnings letter that we posted to our IR site. ","Similar to last quarter, I'm going to keep my opening remarks fairly brief, so we can jump right into Q&A, but I thought it would be important to provide a little bit of context on the business overall.","So, I think, all in, I'm really happy with our performance in the second quarter. Demand across our products and our geos was remarkably consistent throughout the quarter. The only real difference was mix. We clearly underestimated the demand for subscription licensing in the quarter.","The subscription transition for new licensing is really happening faster than we had forecasted across both of our major businesses, which is strategically where we're driving the company.","We expected this accelerated pace to really continue for the full year. The obvious consequence here of the faster shift isn't revenue, margins, earnings and cash flow. We're going to impacted in the short-term with the offset representative on building deferred revenue in particular.","Just to be really clear here, so the mix shift explains the entire difference between our reported second quarter results and our guidance. We had guided a midpoint mix of about 52% and the actual was 62%.","Within this result, we also saw record subscription booking levels in both of our businesses. The workspace product mix jumped up to 71% from 58% a year ago, while networking moved from 11% last year up to 35% in Q2. And I can talk much more about the demand drivers once we get into Q&A.","It's important to point out again that, for all of our financial statements, we're going to be impacted by the business transition, including cash flow, because we typically bill annually for subscription contracts rather than everything upfront like we typically do in perpetual license deal. So, less cash is collected in the current period; more cash is going to be collected in future periods.","So, in other words, the strength that we're seeing in subscription bookings serve to improve our predictability and certainly accelerate our growth in future periods. That's the primary reason why we have introduced future committed revenue as one of our new metrics. Hopefully, you saw that that balance is now up to $2.2 billion. It's up $290 million or 15% from last year. Truly, the easiest way to think about the transition.","But to make the full-year transition math really simple for everybody, let me just give you a quick rule of thumb. That is, for every one percentage point change in mix, it's equal to roughly $10 million to $12 million in recognized revenue for a full year basis. This offsets the decrease in recognized revenue in the period, is generally the corresponding increase to unbilled or deferred revenue, so that when you look at our full-year guidance, we now expect the subscription mix of new product bookings of at least 60% to 65% as compared to 50%, 55% earlier. This is a change from our prior guidance for current guidance.","Finally, this quarter, we are introducing ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, as probably the most important KPI for our business. The way we've calculated this is a bottoms-up contract-based metrics which we believe is really the most important way to measure the performance of this transition.","You'll see a five-quarter history in our earnings letter, and I'll point out for Q2. Total subscription ARR was $614 million and that's up 33% year-on-year, while the SaaS-only ARR was $418 million, and that's up nearly 50% year-over-year. ","As we continue to move through the business model transformation, we expect to see very strong continued growth in both of these metrics. ","So, let me stop there. And with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator so that we can open it up and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I know there's a lot of stuff to go through, David. Like, can you help us a little bit understand, like, what do you see in terms of customers, in terms of term and Citrix service provider versus, like, doing this as a SaaS offering in terms of, like, what do you see there? Because if I look at the numbers on my side, it seems more CSP and term was driving it, but I'm just trying to understand the dynamic there.","David Henshall","Yeah. I'd say all-in two things, Raimo. We're seeing strong growth across all three of those areas. You saw that SaaS-only ARR is the one that really ticked up. It's growing nearly 50% right now at a scale north of $400 million. So, that is the \u2013 probably the cleanest representation of thinking about Citrix Cloud.","The other two businesses that show up in the other subscription, you pointed out CSP, which for everybody is the consumption-based subscription that we have mostly through our partners. That business is north of $100 million run rate now, continues to grow nicely. And then, on-premise term. And I'd say on-premise term is a bridge for a lot of customers as they're moving from a perpetual license to a true subscription. A lot of those tend to be hybrid licenses where they are working through the transition of their own infrastructure. Long-term, we actually want to highlight much more SaaS driven. And so, on-prem term, I look at that as a bit of a bridge in between the two, but the fastest growing part of the business is pure SaaS.","Raimo Lenschow","Perfect. Thank you. Well done.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I actually just have two of them. First, David, if I look at Workspace services, obviously, you highlighted the continued shift to subscription there. But even on a reported basis, you're still up by \u2013 I think it was 7% year-over-year. Wondering if you can just walk us through some of the demand drivers that you've been seeing in the first half because, obviously, this first half year has been through acceleration, like apples-to-apples growth. And then, just one follow-up to that.","David Henshall","Sure, Phil. I'm actually really excited about the Workspace right now. Like you said, we've seen really solid growth in this business on a recognized basis, even though 71% of the mix last quarter came via subscription. When I like quote those numbers, those are new product mix. And so, there's two things going on. We have been leading the market for years around desktop and app virtualization, just pure virtualization. And I think that part of the overall business has seen a nice resurgence in the last couple of years because customers are really focused on mobility and security and those types of opportunities. ","But, really, what's most important for us, and probably most exciting is, the message that we're driving with customers right now about the intelligent Workspace and how we can move those capabilities, not just for those users that are focused on virtualization, but really add value to everybody inside the enterprise.","And we introduced a number of those capabilities at our Synergy conference couple of months ago. We'll be shipping those in the back half of the year. So, I think our message is resonating. And it will allow us, over a long period of time, to really expand our available TAM, drive incremental penetration within our installed base and also look for net new customers that really are not using any form of virtualization. So, that's where we're taking the product line. And that one is, clearly, leading the subscription transition and I would expect it to be close to 80% by the end of the year.","Philip Winslow","Got it. Thanks. And then, just to follow-up, as you mentioned, Synergy, obviously, there were some significant announcements with Microsoft out of Synergy, including Brad Anderson kind of unofficially announcing the renewal of that partnership. Can you just give us an update on just the partnership with Microsoft, particularly the new products that are coming up?","David Henshall","Yeah. I'd say, all in, the partnership is strong as it's been in 20 years. And that's for a couple of reasons. One, we have really good alignment on the field where we're working with customers. A lot of customers are going through major projects, like O365, Azure transformations, lots of bigger projects. And we can joint-sell with Microsoft and really help support a lot of those capabilities. And so, that's been very positive.","In the longer term, that's a huge opportunity for customers to continue to move their Citrix workloads on to Azure or one of the other major cloud properties, and that's why we work so well with them.","Specific to your question about individual products, yes, Brad was with us at Synergy and we announced a number of new things. For example, the support of their new platform, which they call Windows Virtual Desktop. Now, we've integrated that with Citrix Cloud, so that customers can look at that as one more place to run their workloads, giving them really unprecedented flexibility across Citrix Cloud.","We also announced the Citrix Managed Desktops, which is really a DaaS service sitting on top of that platform, and we're doing that with Microsoft and we'll be able to bundle Azure capacity and really create a clean turnkey.","We also announced a number of other areas, and I'm sure I'm going to forget all of them. But optimizations for Windows \u2013 excuse me, for Office 365, for SD-WAN, we can do a lot of really cool things to accelerate the performance of Office, HDX optimizations for teams, SD-WAN more broadly for Windows Virtual Desktop, adding performance and resiliency, as well as a number of other areas. So, I'd say the partnership is as broad as it's certainly been in any time in my 17 years.","Philip Winslow","Great. Thanks, guys.","David Henshall","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Karl Keirstead","Thank you. Hey, Dave. I just want to get to the question of, call it, normalized revenue growth. So, you posted 1% growth, but you mentioned that there was 600 basis point to 700 basis point headwind from the mix. So, call it normalized 7%, 8% growth. I think when you gave guidance three months ago for roughly 3% to 4% growth in 2Q, you were calling for a 200 basis point to 300 basis point hit from the bookings mix, which would equate to normalized growth of, like, 6%, 7%. So, my simple math suggests that you're in line or slightly above your prior guide on a normalized basis. I just wanted to check that math and assess whether it's directionally accurate anyway.","David Henshall","Karl, I think your math is exactly right. If you look at the mix shift, it's basically just our prior expectations and the actuals. It's mix. There's really nothing more to that.","Just step back and think about normalized growth rates. What we've been executing on, if you normalize this whole push to subscription or if you normalize the growth in unbilled revenue, so you can really have apples-to-apples, you look at businesses or a company as a whole that's operating in that mid to high-single digit range, and that's effectively where we'd be operating on a pure steady state basis.","I think as everybody knows, of course, we are driving this transition to create much more incremental value long-term for customers, more stickiness from a product value standpoint and, obviously, that translates into higher returns for investors.","Karl Keirstead","Got it. Okay, thanks. And then, maybe a second question, just on 3Q, your expectation for the subscription bookings mix of 60% to 65% is pretty well in line with what you did in 2Q. And yet, the revenue guidance is for a 3% decline rather than 1% growth. So, your revenue growth decels in 3Q, but your subscription bookings mix is quite similar. Maybe it's a complicated answer, I don't know. But why is that, Dave?","David Henshall","Yeah. Short version of the answer is there's always some seasonality in Q3. Not a whole lot more besides that. And then, the mix of 60% to 65%. Not sure exactly where it's going to fall in that range, but I think the rule of thumb that I laid out is a good way for everyone to think about it.","If you remember, when we went into Q2, we had guided a midpoint of at 52%, 52.5% mix, our revenue outlook would be X. We came in 10 points higher than that. And so, that influences revenue. And I think, as we go forward, if our mix is a little hotter, that's when we'll come in closer to the bottom of our range and vice versa.","Karl Keirstead","Okay. And if no one would get too upset if I ask a third, and I promise I'll stop there, without stealing the thunder from your September 9th Analyst Day where I'm guessing you'll sort of lay out the transition \u2013 the model transition impact on the financials over maybe 2020, 2021, Dave, is there any framework you can give us perhaps now on the call about sort of how long these pressures on revs, EPS, cash flow will last? Is it the kind of thing where things should begin to normalize, call it, second half 2020? Any broad framework ahead of the Analyst Day?","David Henshall","Yeah. Let me talk about it at a high level. You're right, we do need to talk about those things in the context of a longer discussion. So, I think as everybody knows, each year, we update long-term targets as we've been moving through this transition. And that's based on actual results, customer feedback and the outlook. And we're going to do that again this year at our analyst meeting in a couple of months.","But let's take a bit of a step back for a minute. And so, we're two years into this transition. I think we've made really good progress, all in. But unlike other model transitions that we've seen across the industry, we've never really seen any material impact on the P&L up to this point.","And I think that's been for two reasons. First is that we've just had better internal execution and a really good product story, so we've sold more. We've sold more and we've just been trying to balance the impact up to that point. And so, phase one has been focused really on net new, largely due to capacity and focus. And so, last year, we moved about 42% of the net new mix to subscription. This year, as I said, we're looking at 60%, 65%. So, that's a big increase and the numbers are now large enough that it's creating this headwind that you're seeing over the course of Q2 and the balance of this year really into the reported P&L. Again, like I mentioned a minute ago, the offset is going to show up in deferred and unbilled, plus these new metrics. So, everybody has complete visibility.","The way I'm thinking about the next couple of years, though, is phase two is going to bring much more focus on transitioning our really big installed base. So, we've started that this year and we've seen a nice uplift in kind of the annualized dollars that those customers are paying, for those we've transitioned so far. So, this is a big incremental opportunity. In fact, hundreds of millions of dollars annually. That's going to start to become a priority in 2020.","And that's why, to help everybody understand this, we've delivered these new metrics, unbilled revenue, ARR in particular, so that everybody can really just see how it impacts beyond the reported P&L. So, we'll talk about all that at our next analyst meeting and make sure that you have complete perspective. And again, we're providing the metrics, so you can measure us along the way, look much more like a traditional subscription transition and looking forward to having that in-depth conversation.","Karl Keirstead","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Thank you, David. Just a couple of questions left here. Just on the point that you just mentioned in terms of phase two of the transition of the installed base, any comments you could mention about churn thus far as you've been seeing those big customers transition and kind of what the level of uplift is that you're getting on a pricing for those that are staying and kind of what the price realization is?","And then, I just wanted to follow up. Just I know Phil asked a question about Microsoft. My question is just more related to Windows 10. There's been some people wondering how much of a driver that's been to the whole Workspace Services business and how does that \u2013 that's going, the migration from Windows 7 to Windows 10 which has to be done by mid-January? Does that become a headwind when you start to think about calendar 2020 top line? Thank you.","David Henshall","Yeah. Let me talk about the second question first. I don't hear that much about Win 10 as a standalone driver. I think desktop OS isn't the driver that it would have been for a major project like it was a decade ago. I'd say it's one of the many projects that customers are looking at and it's one of the things that we can engage in.","I'd say that, more broadly speaking, when we're talking to customers today, and every customer meeting that I had throughout Q2 was focused, I'd say, first on security, on how they're looking at managing an increasingly complex infrastructure. Second, on mobility, around just finally enabling devices to be used in the enterprise in a secure, simple way across what is usually hundreds of applications in most enterprises.","And then, lastly, this idea that's a little bit more about our roadmap and our vision about really embracing employee productivity and driving engagement and things that'll just make them \u2013 their teams more productive. And so, I'd say that's probably the bigger driver than any one-off like a Win 10 migration.","Back to the other question about the installed base. Yeah, we've actually seen really good success with those customers that we've updated so far. I'd say it's a limited set. So, I wouldn't read too far into it, but the average uplift that we saw in Q2 was like 40% from what they had been paying on a typical maintenance contract. And again, that's because it's not just a like-for-like, but this whole migration opportunity is about moving them from what might have been a virtual app sale to a more broad Workspace sale.","And so, we'll get that uplift as we do that, but it also provides that platform for us to start expanding more horizontally into untapped seats inside that customer. So, it's really a dual strategy. So, I'm really happy with what we've seen so far and we just have to scale that up. And it's one of the reasons why we've unified our renewals motions globally now. We have introduced a new COO into the company, an existing employee, and help focus on really driving this phase two in the next couple of years.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you.","David Henshall","Thanks, Heather.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much. And I really appreciate the fact that you guys are giving more color. And the ARR numbers and the breakdown of it is going to be helpful, as well as the additional color in the filing. Two questions for you. I apologize there are two. The first question is, while subscription bookings as a percentage of total product bookings were 62% in the quarter, can you give us some color on the percentage of the installed bases that is through the subscription? You've given a little color. Is there a better sense of what percentage of the base really has moved? Or are we really in the point at which the subscription Citrix Cloud is really all from net new? And then, I have a follow-up.","David Henshall","Sure. The first question, Mark, it's largely net new. We're looking at, I'd say, less than 10% of the installed base has moved at this point in time. And one important point to point out is that we are still selling perpetual licenses. And so, the installed base, as you define it, is still moving. It's still growing. So, it's not static necessarily.","But that said, I'd say it's less than 10% at this point, and that's been intentional. We wanted to make sure that we get this whole process moving around and focus around net new, and I think that's important. And once we have that going, and you've seen this really driving the business over the last couple of years, this gives us a much better framework to go and drive installed base.","And I also think it's also given us an opportunity to really mature the product sets across Citrix Cloud, across the intelligent workspace and all these new initiatives, so that it's not just a migrate to cloud story. It's a much broader opportunity to talk about employee productivity and ways that we can help really drive what, in marketing terms, we call the future of work, but a holistic strategy for customers.","Mark Moerdler","Excellent. I really appreciate it. And then, as a follow-up, while Citrix Cloud is cloud, how should we think about the impact on gross margin? Is this more like a subscription where the margin impact is very low or is this more like a SaaS? How should we think about it?","David Henshall","Yeah. I'd say it's a good question, Mark. At a high level, our services are not necessarily compute or data intensive. And therefore, at scale, we can manage with pretty high gross margins. That said, before we get to scale and we're bringing on more and more customers, I think there's a little bit of upfronts there. There's probably a 50 basis point headwind in the first half of the year on gross margins. Not big, but it's there. And we, obviously, have teams that are focused on not just cloud COGS and optimizing that, but all of the aspects of cloud operations. And so, there'll be some pressure on gross margins over the years, but we'll manage that. Our services are built out with full multi-tenancy and the things you would imagine. And so, we'll be optimizing across the board.","Mark Moerdler","Perfect. I apologize. I never do this, but I've got one quick. Can you give a little more color on the NetScaler move to subscription and what the drivers are, what the lift is like? Any more data would be appreciated since no one is really focused at this point on that.","David Henshall","No, that's okay, Mark. It's actually a really interesting dynamic that's happening right now. I'd say, I think as everybody would understand, there are secular changes going on in networking in general, really driven by the adoption of cloud more than anything else. And so, what we've seen over the last few quarters is a more pronounced move to software versus hardware. And that's simply because customers are looking for more flexibility, more choices in the way that they deploy their capabilities.","And the good news for Citrix, in particular, is that we're a software company and we can deploy our networking hardware on a physical appliance, in a virtual container, in a docker container, as a service and a number of other things. And that's what gives customers flexibility.","So, the dynamic we're seeing right now is that customers that maybe in the past would have thought about a hardware refresh cycle, now they're looking at it as why don't I do a software refresh cycle where I can buy in our licensing terms, a pool capacity license that could be shared across an on-premise infrastructure, any form of hybrid, in a cloud, in a container, et cetera.","We've got this great control plane that allows you to help manage that in a reasonably seamless way. So, it just gives customers a lot more flexibility. And that's something that we've got as pretty unique capabilities and we're pushing that in the market fairly aggressively, and customers are responding. I think 35% of the mix in one quarter is a little higher than I would have expected. That's up from just over 10% a year ago, but that's a trend I expect to continue.","Mark Moerdler","Excellent. Really appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Daniel Bergstrom","Hey, it's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking our question. So, the acceleration in subscription is very impressive. You pointed out some drivers, such as Hybrid Multi-Cloud, Citrix Cloud in the investor letter and prepared remarks here. But could you pinpoint further the change in pace here versus last quarter? It's really dramatic.","David Henshall","Yeah, it is. Q1, we were at 50% of the mix; Q2, we're at 62%. And I think in the second half of the year, we're going to be pushing 65% or higher to get to that full year of 60%, 65%. So, we're moving at pretty rapid pace right now.","As I pointed out, you can see in our letter, 71% of Workspace mix is now coming via subscription. That was up about 10 points from Q1 and 15 points or so year-on-year. That business will continue to move up. Obviously, the gains will start to slow down on an incremental mix basis because it's still rich [ph]. And then Networking, it's moved up much more materially from 10% a year ago to 35% now. That's the biggest change.","We will still continue to sell a fair bit of hardware. So, I do not expect that in the next 12 months, let's say, to get north of 50%, but I think the rate that we're at right now is probably a pretty good floor and it will move up from here.","And it's a function of two things. I think we have tried as a company to balance the transition, actively balance that over the last six, eight quarters, while giving customers the choice that they want. Now, we're just letting it \u2013 embracing it and letting it happen at a bit more of a natural pace. And so, you'll see it continue the way it was in Q2 into the back half of the year.","Daniel Bergstrom","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Sanjit Singh","Hi. This is Sanjit Singh in for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe to start off in terms of managing, let's say, phase two of the transition. From an operating margin perspective, is the view that you would just sort of let the transition happen as rapidly as possible, take the headwinds on margins upfront and kind of move, accelerate through the transition to get to a better margin profile down the road or is the view that you will continue to protect margins as you execute through phase two?","David Henshall","Well, I think as you see the impact on the top line and certainly the overall growth, that will flow all the way through the P&L. We saw that in Q2 and in our guidance for the second half of the year. I think we've moved margins up a lot in the last couple of years. And so, we're not going to do anything artificial. We're investing to drive and grow the business and drive the transition. We're, of course, always thoughtful in how we manage our expenses and our headcount growth and those types of things because we want to make sure we're investing in the right areas. But we absolutely have a view on how are we going to drive long-term sustainable growth. And so, I wouldn't expect anything artificial from us in that regard.","Sanjit Singh","Got it. And for the follow-up in terms of the new metrics that you released this quarter on paid subscriber count, it sounds like we're at 5.4 million today. If I understood you correctly, that's mostly net new. As we think about the maintenance base transitioning over to cloud, where do you think that number goes to? What do you think is sort of the number of available subscriber count that you have to transition? Does that 5.4 million \u2013does that increase significantly over the next couple of years? Any view on where that number could go?","David Henshall","It could go much, much higher. We're certainly not going to guide that one yet because that's predicated on a few different movements. But if you think about our installed base right now, it is tens and tens of millions of active users. And so, the opportunity pool is very material. I think it's premature for us to try and put a number on that right now, but I think we're at the very front end of the broader opportunity.","Sanjit Singh","Appreciate. Thank you for taking the questions.","David Henshall","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jacqueline Waldman","Hi. This is actually Jacqueline on for Nikolay. So, two questions. First, can you please give us some concrete examples of how Workspace will coexist with Windows Virtual Desktop and any areas of current or potential overlap?","And my second question is, what needs to happen from a product pricing or go-to-market perspective for the installed base to begin to move to the cloud?","David Henshall","Sure. There's couple of questions in there. If you're coming back to the Microsoft-specific question, think about Windows Virtual Desktop as a platform, very similar to the way people have thought about remote desktop services over the years, which was part of Windows Server. I think that's the easiest way to conceptualize it. And so, as a platform, it's a multi-user version of Win 10. And so, for a lot of our customers, they would look at that as maybe a use case that makes sense in part of their business alongside everything else they're trying to accomplish.","Our average customer is delivering over 500 applications across all different app types. And so, for us to be able to open up Windows Virtual Desktop as another resource or another type of capability that could be managed inside of Citrix Cloud, very similar to the way you would be managing, for example, an on-premise application or maybe a published SaaS application. So, for a lot of customers, it just provides more flexibility. ","From a platform standpoint, Citrix building a DaaS service on top of that really just embraces and extends a lot of the capabilities to be much more feature-rich on the enterprise side. So, that's probably the easiest way to think about that. It's a component of a broader infrastructure from a typical Citrix customer standpoint.","And can you repeat the question about go-to-market?","Jacqueline Waldman","Yeah. Just curious on what needs to happen from a product or pricing or go-to-market perspective for the installed base to begin to move to the cloud?","David Henshall","Well, I'd say, for the most part, the product is there and the pricing is there. And it's just a matter of focus from our point of view. We have dis-incented that really from a compensation standpoint. We did that intentionally. I've talked about that each quarter because teams only have so much bandwidth and we want to have to focus on net new in order to really start building the base. ","There is a big opportunity around the installed base, and so we'll start expanding that and really leveraging the success we've had in some of the early areas. So, I think it's just about making sure we have enough capacity to serve customers, and that's why we've been investing in quota-carrying folks for the last couple of years, as well as customer success. And then, we'll tweak compensation along the way to make sure we're incenting the right outcomes as we go into 2020 and beyond.","Jacqueline Waldman","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John DiFucci","Thank you. David, I have seven questions. Actually, I'm only kidding. I only have one. I only have one. Listen, we understand the mix change and its effect on the financials. That all makes sense. But deferred revenue was also lower than expected. And I would have expected that that would have been much better, given the outsized ratable bookings. So, can you explain that?","David Henshall","Yeah. Two things on deferred. One, we had a really big \u2013 if you look back, a really big seasonal comp because we did a mega deal in Q2 a year ago. And that was a large mid-eight-figure deal. That's one thing. So, that's the seasonal point.","The other is, most of your growth is coming in unbilled right now instead of deferred because the contracts are moving to SaaS. And SaaS are three-year deals on average, one-year billed upfront. We didn't have unbilled a year ago and now it's $380 million, I think, Jessica. And so, that's the primary offset.","John DiFucci","But I would think that the one year that you do bill upfront would be more than \u2013 well, I guess it'd be more than the maintenance that you'd bill and that would go into deferred. I just \u2013 okay, I'm sorry. You said there are two things. Did you say both of them?","David Henshall","No. I'd point you back to ARR as well. And the reason we did that on a contractual basis, A, it's duration adjusted and, B, it just gives you the best end-of-quarter visibility into what's really going on. And we're going to continue to deliver that on both a total subscription basis and a SaaS basis. And so, I'd point you back there, but all-in deferred and unbilled were up 15% year-on-year and I'm happy with that. I think it will continue to grow in the future.","John DiFucci","Okay. Okay. Thanks, David.","David Henshall","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Brad Reback","Great. Thanks very much. David, with the headwinds from the subscription going forward here, does it impact your ability to return capital to shareholders? And if it does, to what effect? Thanks.","David Henshall","Not materially. I think that when we look at how we have thought about capital return over the years, we've been really consistent. We're always focused first and foremost on things that will grow the company, great M&A at the right price, and that's a priority. And when we find those, we execute on that. We also return excess capital via dividends, via share repurchase. And I'm not sure that that's going to change in the future.","Brad Reback","Great. Thanks very much.","David Henshall","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Peter Levine","Great, thanks. Peter Levine in for Kirk. Just two quick ones. Sorry if I missed earlier, but can you give an update on the CFO search? And then second, just to piggyback off of the mix shift in the quarter, you talked about it, but just anything you would call out on the sales or maybe the partner side that accelerated this quarter that kind of made you change your guidance there? Thanks.","David Henshall","Yeah. Let me take the second part first. I'd say that, with the benefit of hindsight, we'd probably been holding it back a little bit in prior quarters what was the normal customer emotion. And so, we're just letting it happen much more naturally. And I think that's representative of what you're seeing right now. And given the scale of the business, it's time to really lean in and embrace the transition and drive it more aggressively than we have been. So, I'd say that that's the easiest way to think about that and why we want to drive this expectation over the balance of the year. Start looking a little bit more like a typical subscription transition that people are used to seeing across companies.","On the CFO search, it's going well. We've met with a number of external candidates. We have some great internal candidates as well. And we're just going through the process very methodically. We've got such a solid team right now that I feel comfortable where we are, but I'm more focused on making the right decision than making a quick decision. That said, hopefully, we'll get this wrapped up fairly quickly.","Peter Levine","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And it looks like our next question is a follow-up from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Hey. Thanks guys for taking my follow-up. Actually just two follow-ups. David, obviously, you mentioned some of the changes in just the market when it comes to the Networking business. With the subscription and some of those changes and just sort of how NetScaler \u2013 NG is being delivered. How should we think about the revenue breakeven from the old, call it, product\/license model plus maintenance to subscription? And then also, how should we think about sort of just the gross margin differential?","David Henshall","Yeah. Phil, gross margin is going to be higher because we're selling software that looks more like a typical software gross margin than a hardware gross margin. So, the change has probably got higher gross margin dollars. From a revenue standpoint, you're not selling the box along with it. So, you may have a little bit of revenue headwind in the short term. But getting customers to build this out from a software standpoint is part of their infrastructure. I think it's going to drive really good stickiness. So, I'd have to go back and look at it on a \u2013 it's probably a little bit more case by case than in the aggregate. But I'd say that they breakeven from gross margin and really the extension of gross margin dollars is relatively short term.","Philip Winslow","Great. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. I will now turn the call back over to David for any closing remarks.","David Henshall","So, I thank everybody again. I appreciate all of the multi-part questions along the way. I just want to reiterate a couple of things as we go through this. We're driving the business towards a subscription model, probably faster than we would have anticipated over the course of the last several quarters. I think Q2 is a great example of that performance shift relative to guidance, and that's why we updated the back half of the year.","We're delivering all these incremental metrics to make sure that you can look at the business holistically, whether that's ARR, with subscription ARR up 33% and SaaS ARR up nearly 50%. So, those will be the most important ways to view the business on a go-forward basis.","Hopefully, everybody can join us at our upcoming analyst meeting in the next couple of months. Look forward to seeing you there. And if not, talk to you again in three months. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's Citrix conference call. You may now disconnect.

And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I hope everybody has had a chance to review the earnings letter that we posted a little while ago to our Investor Relations site. ","Similar to last quarter, let me provide just a quick summary here and then we'll jump right into Q&A. I'd say, overall, really happy with our performance for the fourth quarter. It's highlighted by 41% year-over-year growth in subscription ARR, 49% growth in SaaS ARR, and a 15% increase in deferred and unbilled revenue. ","I'd say our model transition continues to progress really well across both Workspace and our Networking businesses, coming ahead of the accelerated plan that we outlined just last year.","In the quarter, 69% of total product bookings came via subscription and this is up from just 51% a year ago. In fact, in this quarter, we signed a couple of the largest Networking contracts in our history and we signed those as multi-year subscriptions, really reflecting the customer confidence in our strategy, roadmap and our ability to execute on where that market is going.","Also, our new Workspace with intelligence platform was made generally available in December. Personally, I think, this is the most significant feature functionality release that we brought to market since the introduction of the Workspace. A good platform that we're going to be driving and scaling over the coming years. ","So, all in, really good quarter, solid progress against our multi-year goals.","So, with that, let me open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Philip Winslow","Hey, thanks, guys, for taking my question. And congrats on a great end of the year. Just want to \u2013 actually, focusing in on the Networking business, obviously, David, you called out some pretty significant transactions there as well as a pretty big shift to the pooled capacity licensing. Wondering if you could just walk us through that. ","And then, Arlen, wondering if you could help us just think through sort of the net impact of that because, obviously, it was a big step-up in terms of the subscription bookings this quarter?","David Henshall","Sure, Phil. Yeah, let me take the first part. So, from a strategy standpoint, I think as everyone knows, what we've been trying to do is really leverage the fact that we're a software company. And we can deploy our networking services across just a myriad of different form factors, as appliance, as software, virtual appliance as a service and a container et cetera. And we just have a lot of flexibility to do that. And we've got a unique control plane that \u2013 we call it ADM \u2013 that effectively allows customers to manage across all of those different deployment models. And that ties really nicely with the hybrid multi-cloud nature of most customers' infrastructure. With the transition that's going on in terms of application architectures, that's just a really, really nice bridge for a lot of customers. So, we're pushing that as our primary model and that is what's driving pooled capacity. It's just a strategic thing, but it's also a longer-term business model shift.","As you saw, we had a really big pop in terms of the overall mix in the quarter, going up to 63% from 2018. That was influenced, as I mentioned, a minute ago by a couple of really large transactions. I wouldn't expect that to be the run rate. That percentage will come back down, but generally it continues to being up into the right motion.","Arlen Shenkman","Yeah. What I'd add to that, Phil, as David said, if you look at the full year, for the full year for the Networking business, we basically ended at 44% mix, and that's compared to 13% come out of 2018. I don't think we're going to be able to hold that. But I think we do see our customers buying into our strategy. They do like our pooled licensing arrangement. And I think, honestly, what I'd tell you is, I think you'll see this start to show itself in ARR, and that's probably the best place to focus as we go through this.","Philip Winslow","Got it. Thanks, guys.","David Henshall","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much. David, I have a couple of questions, if you don't mind. I guess, in no particular order, you guys signed, I think it was, a million Citrix cloud seats in the quarter, if I'm reading your press release correctly, which is a pretty big uptick. I'm just wondering if you could walk people through what's driving that. There's always a lot of debate in the market, how much of this is being driven from Windows 7 end of life. And then, I've got two quick follow-ups, if you don't mind. Thank you.","David Henshall","Sure. You're right. As far as paid subscriber count, we ended Q4 with 7.1 million. That's up more than 60% year-over-year from just over 4 million. What's really driving that is just a continuation of the overall strategy that we've been talking about now for a couple of years.","From a current customer standpoint, migrating to Citrix cloud does a few things. One, it really simplifies their ability to maintain their infrastructure to have lots of tools and services to optimize that and drive that forward and allow us to do the heavy lifting that we can scale across just really all of our customers. And so, it's a huge benefit on just the pure like-for-like, but probably much more importantly, though, is it unlocks a lot of new capabilities that are really only available as a service, whether that is something as simple as endpoint management on a unified basis across all of their infrastructure to some of our net new capabilities like Workspace with Intelligence, which will only be available as a service. So, it's a combination of really optimizing what they have today for those set of customers, but it provides that foundation for them to grow going forward.","And so, we're just \u2013 I think we're doing a better and better job every quarter of articulating the value. Our sales teams are having conversations higher up in the executive ranks. And we're talking about things that are, I would describe as, really information type initiatives, much more so than a traditional IT delivery initiatives. So, it's a combination of all of those different factors.","Heather Bellini","Okay, great. And then, the two quick follow-ups would be, if you could just remind us, obviously, you've been going through the subscription transition. And as a result of that, there is a headwind to revenue growth. Could you remind us on \u2013 based on your current expectations about mix, whether you want to take the midpoint or not? What type of headwind to revenue growth is that for 2020? ","And then, the other question would be just subscription ARR growth for 2020. Obviously, I heard your comments about being up 41% in Q4. Any commentary on the type of growth people might be able to expect out of that subscription ARR for this year? Thank you.","David Henshall","Sure. Heather, we're not going to guide from a subscription ARR standpoint at least in 2020. And that's simply a function of it's a relatively new metric. We want to make sure that it is one that we can have forecasting with really, really good accuracy. But more importantly, I'd take a step back, and you look at it just over the last few quarters, that's where all of this business model transition is starting to unwind. I think if I remember correctly, it was 33% growth in Q2, 40% in Q3, 41% in Q4. So, we're actually seeing an acceleration of that as the numbers get bigger. And that's just a reflection of both net new, which is still the majority, as well as migrating more of the installed base going forward. I'm sorry, could you repeat the first\u2026?","Heather Bellini","Yeah. Just the last question was the headwind to 2020 revenue growth from the transition, if you kind of take the midpoint of your expectations on where you will be on subscription mix, how should people be thinking about the headwind that you're experiencing to top line this year?","David Henshall","Yeah. We didn't break it out in terms of guidance for 2020. But back when we started this transition, we were posting the headwind and it was in that 700 basis point, 800 basis point range. We stopped doing that just because we've got ARR out there, and I think everybody is well aware of the transition metrics. But it was 7 percentage points or 8 percentage points the last time we reported it.","Heather Bellini","Okay, great. Thank you.","David Henshall","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead","Thank you. Maybe I'll start with Arlen. In the earnings letter, you gave the 2020 guidance, but I didn't see a reiteration of the $7 to $8 per share in free cash flow. So, maybe a two-parter for you. Still feel comfortable with that? And then secondly, I know that, as the installed base converts to ratable, there is the potential for billing or invoicing durations to compress a little bit, which would take a little bit of zip out of free cash flow. Have you seen any of that kind of duration compression over the last couple of months? Thank you.","Arlen Shenkman","Yeah. So, Karl, I'll start with \u2013 look, we remain comfortable with the $7 to $8. That's, obviously, included in our guidance in terms of what we delivered at Investor Day, and there is no change in that. And as you point out rightfully, obviously, there are some complexities in terms of how the duration affects the cash when that gets in the door, hence the range as well as how we think about the business.","In terms of your question about compression, I haven't really seen compression. I think, if anything, if you look at the length, it's a bit longer actually in terms of duration. We had 1.7 years. Obviously, we're generally entering into 36-month contracts. So, we'd expect that duration to continue. But, obviously, in terms of how we think about cash flow, the biggest impact for us is the mix over the course of the year and how that results itself or reflects itself in the business. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, David.","David Henshall","Yeah. Karl, I think you're not asking about the duration on the contract, which has been going out. I think it's more about prepayment. ","Karl Keirstead","That's right.","David Henshall","That absolutely has been a headwind because, a year or two ago, when we talked about the majority of our customers not only were buying perpetual license, but were also buying multi-years of maintenance and paying for that upfront. ","As we've been unwinding that model to get to a much more pure, just a pure run rate, that's been a tremendous headwind to cash flow. And that's pretty much run its course. We haven't broken it out in a couple of quarters, but it's a very low percentage now versus where it was. So, I think that headwind is pretty much gone at this point.","Karl Keirstead","Okay, great. And then, maybe my second question for you, David, is just this earnings call is \u2013 really in the earnings letter and in your words \u2013 really putting a little bit more focus on the 4Q launch of these intelligence analytics features that you described as the most significant functionality at Workspace in your history. So, I wouldn't mind, given that, pressing a little bit. So, I know that they just went GA probably a little over a month ago, but, David, any early anecdotes or numbers you can share that, for instance, when installed base contracts are up for renewal in December or so far in January, those that have acquired the new features, you tend to see revenue accretion of X. Anything interesting you can share that would kind of support the view that this could be a needle mover for Citrix?","David Henshall","Yeah, Karl. I'd say, at a high level, it's different than the old days of perpetual license when a new release was a giant event. This is much more about evolving the platform. And so, the way we've positioned this with customers really over the last year \u2013 and we've been pretty transparent about this \u2013 is that this is the direction that the Workspace is really moving. It's moving towards a platform approach that allows us to really provide a solution that's applicable to users of all type, whether those users have very simple needs like Office 365 and a couple of SaaS applications or whether that is the group of users that need all the power of virtualization, VDI, et cetera.","And so, the platform allows us to really cover all of those on a wall-to-wall basis and then provide that level of segmentation from an end user standpoint, the right tool to the right solution, but also a platform that we can continue to drive upsell opportunities, so that we can have an ongoing customer conversation about new things that we're bringing to the market. For example, security analytics, performance analytics and others that we haven't announced at this point in time.","And so, the big shift is just how we engage and think about the Workspace. And it's going to be moving much more from an organizing IT focus where I think we were over the course of the last couple of years to much more about modernizing applications, guiding and helping predict work. And so, that's a big shift and that's an exciting conversation that we're having now with, not just CIOs, but more and more frequently people that carry titles like chief digital transformation officer, chief marketing officer and others. So, we're excited about it, but I think it's going to be just a gradual thing that we continue to ramp throughout the year.","Karl Keirstead","Got it. Okay. Thank you both.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you. And congratulations on the quarter. Nice clean results. I've got a couple of questions for you, but I'll keep it simple. Can you give us an update on where you are on the process of no longer selling the Citrix Burst Workspace licenses? And how do you think if any had made an impact on Q4 license sales? Did it create a larger-than-normal license sale in the quarter? And then, I have a follow-up.","David Henshall","So, Mark, let me just grab that. Look, we talked at Investor Day about end licensing perpetual plus maintenance. We are in the process of working that through our system. You see no impact of that in the fourth quarter. We have not implemented that. You'll continue to hear us talk about through the course of the year, but we have not taken any action and there is no reflection of that in our current year-end results. And the bookings mix was already three quarter subscription in the Workspace. So, the impact will be relatively muted on a go-forward basis.","Mark Moerdler","Okay. And then, can you give us any sort of an update on where you are on the what was existing installed base of Citrix Workspace in terms of how much is moving or are you seeing any bigger opportunity? Any color on where that on the installed base starting to move over to subscription and cloud?","David Henshall","Yeah, let me take that one. We're early on still. I'd say that number is right around \u2013 less than 10% of the installed base. The installed base continues to move because we are still selling perpetual licenses. So, the installed base is growing while we transition. The amount of transition has moved up pretty materially over the last couple of quarters. Probably most importantly is that we're still yielding the level of uplift that we talked about at our financial analyst meeting while the numbers get bigger. So, I think the opportunity is pretty significant and we'll be doing much more of that throughout 2020.","Mark Moerdler","Excellent. Really appreciate it. Thanks.","David Henshall","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies.","Parthiv Varadarajan","Yeah, thanks. This is Parthiv on for Brent. In terms of the outlook, I think the letter indicates that guidance for 2020 assumes a subscription bookings mix of 65% to 75%. And if I'm looking at this right, you were expecting up to 80% at the Analyst Day. So, I guess, the question is, are your assumptions in the business changing at the margin here or are they still within the band that you had expected back at the Analyst Day?","David Henshall","Yeah. I don't think anything has changed here. As you see, there's, obviously, some seasonality. We've talked about the first quarter being much closer to the 55% to 60% range. You see us for the full year looking at 65% to 75%, and that's consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day. Obviously, over time, we will go beyond that 75%, but when we think about 2020, we think that's the right way to approach it. And it's very consistent with what we went over in terms of our roadmap and our plans for the business.","Parthiv Varadarajan","Okay, got it. And then, for the CSP business, I think the last data point that we got was in the second quarter of 2019. I think you talked about a $100 million run rate. Maybe any update on that end in terms of run rate or growth rates and maybe talk about the mix between on-prem CSP versus the cloud?","David Henshall","Yeah. Parthiv, it's not something that we really break out much anymore. I think now that we're into the complete subscription transition, all of these things are just included in the overall number and it would just confuse people to try and break out individual piece parts. Overall, though, CSP is a channel program that allows channel partners to leverage our infrastructure to create as a service offering. It's for their end customer. ","It has been a great business like you highlighted. Continues to be so. And it is in nine figures and growing. I don't really know where those customers are in terms of on-prem or cloud infrastructure. Obviously, over the long term, they have a lot more flexibility as they move to Citrix Cloud, but it just depends on the size of the partner.","Parthiv Varadarajan","Okay, fair enough. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard","Hey, David. A product question for you. Just as it relates to Windows Virtual Desktops which I think Microsoft launched in Q4, how have you found that offering from Microsoft being out there impacting your business? Is it creating awareness? Is it causing some confusion? Helping the transition to subscription? Just curious what, if any, impact you're seeing at this point.","David Henshall","Well, I think WVD at a high level really opens up the awareness for virtualization as a platform. And we look at it as a platform or, in our language, a resource zone where we can allow customers to run parts of their infrastructure along with like on-prem or in another cloud or public cloud, et cetera. So, it's a resource zone from that respect.","When it was first announced, it created some market confusion. And so, between Citrix and Microsoft, we've been spending a lot of time educating our field. We just had our sales kickoff a week ago. We had Microsoft and Citrix on stage really talking to all of our partners and our sellers about what the real separation is, how to position and how we work together at this. ","This is really a story about better together with Microsoft. And we spend a lot of time highlighting everything we're doing from a joint customer standpoint, joint field standpoint, all the product integrations and we're going to continue to do that. So, no change on that front.","Walter Pritchard","Great. And then, Arlen, for you. Just on the \u2013 I want to make sure I was clear on the Networking piece, the subscription mix went up substantially there. Is that a trend that you think is sustainable as we move forward? Or was there some element with a flexible licensing in Q4 that drove customers to choose that offering that may not be sustainable here in the first half of 2020?","Arlen Shenkman","So, I think what you'll continue to see is growth. I think the magnitude and I think the data point I'd try to utilize that, 13% to 44% for the year. I think that magnitude is driven by some of the larger deals we did. So, I'm very confident that we'll continue to see customers move in that direction. I believe we're very confident in the fact that you'll continue to see an increase. One, we're just not confident that that magnitude in terms of the moving parts in the business, the number of customers will be that consistent in terms of driving that.","Walter Pritchard","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Participant","Hi. Mark O'Neill [ph] for Keith Weiss. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe two quick ones on converting that existing maintenance base that we've been talking about. One, I guess, just how big is that maintenance base in terms of like licenses that could be transitioned? ","And then two, you noted still less than like 10% of the way through like at Analyst Day on October. I guess looking into the next few years when you continue focusing on transitioning that base, maybe just like level set expectations, how much should we be thinking about per year? Maybe it's like 10%. Or is that too high or too low? Kind of some way to think about that would be helpful in modeling.","David Henshall","Yeah. We're not going to guide to a specific percentage basis. We're, obviously, looking to build the right programs to go as fast as customers want to go and we're not planning on any type of a forced migration. It's simply going to be put the right programs in front of them, give them the sense of value, and allow customers to adopt this. That part has been growing from a \u2013 internally, we call it trade up and transition. It's growing very rapidly right now. ","It is still the minority focus. So, I want to be clear about that. We are still more focused on selling net new licenses to both new and existing customers and then trade up becomes a secondary motion.","But in terms of the overall magnitude, just look at \u2013 look at the P&L and you see the support and services line. The bulk of that is related to ongoing maintenance contracts, although both hardware and software. So, it's well over $1 billion opportunity there from an ongoing maintenance standpoint. And we just want to make sure that we're converting that at the uplift that we've been seeing up to this point and we're doing it methodically, so the customers really drive the value that they see in the solutions.","We're also starting to incent channel partners on things like active use to make sure that not only are we migrating customers, but we're driving the right level of use and providing that platform, so that, as we get onto Workspace with Intelligence and some of these new capabilities, we have that pathway to sell new things, new updates, new add-ons, new capabilities. And so, that's the overall motion we're driving right now.","Unidentified Participant","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Mohit Gogia","Hey, guys. It's Mohit Gogia on for Raimo. Thanks for taking my question. I'll also offer my congrats on the quarter, on a solid quarter. Two questions. So, one, David, I was wondering if you can drill into just the SSP business performance. So, obviously, we saw a nice rebound this quarter just based on the much easier comps from last year. But looking into 2020, should we expect the same volatility just based on the seasonality and the comps for next year as well? Or is there anything else we should be aware of? And then I have a question for Arlen.","David Henshall","Sure. It's just at a high level. SSP, we'll continue to break it out for a while because it is volatile and it's a small handful. It's now down to, I don't know, 3%, 4% of total revenue. So it's not material, but it does move around a little bit. It's going to continue to be volatile. Although, I will say that part of the strategy that we're driving right now is to work with these customers on the multi-year types of arrangements, so that while there will always be a hardware element, we're going to focus much more of the engagement on the long-term software, containers, and those types of things to support where their businesses are going. So, I'd say that the volatility will become less and less pronounced over time, but it will still be there for a while. But just keep it in the context of its \u2013 it's 3% or 4% of total revenue. So, it's not that big a deal.","Mohit Gogia","Understood. That's helpful. And, Arlen, just one question, just a modeling question on deferred. So, based on the commentary that we have heard around \u2013 that you guys are phasing away the multi-year maintenance contracts being billed upfront. We would have thought that there will be somewhat more of a headwind on deferred this quarter. Obviously, we saw some nice seasonal uptick, the sequential uptick, but if you can give us some more color as to how that sort of like phasing away from multi-year maintenance will show up in deferred. Maybe it hasn't been rolled out yet, but just some more color on deferred for modeling will be helpful.","Arlen Shenkman","Yeah. I think, look, I would go back \u2013 if you take a step back, and we talked a lot about this at Investor Day, but when you think about the business, I would say, the first way to kind of think about the normalization is look at ARR. After you move away from ARR, you're going to start to get an idea of where we're headed in terms of our future committed revenues and you'll see more and more of that buildup, obviously, in unbilled in terms of how that will react in the business.","And one of the reasons I started with ARR is because one of the things that you'll have to deal with, and that we'll deal with in terms of how we model and think about our business, is the effect of 606. And as we do on-prem term licenses and how those kind of pull in, how that have an effect on the business. And so, even though we'll continue to move away from prepaid maintenance, you're going to continue to see movement around that deferred line. And as you said, we had an uptick in seasonality. We feel good particularly on a quarter-by-quarter basis when you look at that where we're headed. But, obviously, there's going to continue to be volatility depending on mix, and some of that mix is not only the mix in terms of SaaS, but it's on-prem term license as well as the pool licenses we have for the Networking business, which is all going to have an impact and it's going to move across our short-term and long-term deferred.","Mohit Gogia","Sounds good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert Majek with Raymond James.","Robert Majek","Great. Thanks a lot. Can you give us an update on Citrix Managed Desktops and how the sell-through has been so far with your partners and customers? And then, additionally, is this an offering we'll see you put more emphasis on going forward?","David Henshall","Yeah. CMD, just for everybody, that is our fully packaged DaaS offering that we're building with Microsoft on top of Windows Virtual Desktops. Really a complete way to give customers a turnkey service. Those things are just now going live. So, there's not a whole lot of history yet, but we'll look at it and talk about it much more going forward. It's similar to the way I described the platform earlier, where the important part of the strategy is lay the foundation, so that we've got a platform approach that covers all users regardless of their end \u2013 kind of their end user requirements and then have those individual solutions that allow us to continue to segment users much more specifically based on their usage. So, that could be a full VDI solution, it could be a Citrix Managed Desktop, it could be just simply analytics. It's that level of flexibility that I think is most critical going forward. ","So, stay tuned. In a couple of quarters, we'll provide an update just in terms of overall uptake. But I think the story that we talk about is going to be much more platform oriented.","Robert Majek","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your final question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne","Yeah, thanks. Thanks very much. And congrats on the quarter. I guess, David, the question I have for you is, coming away from sales kickoff and as you go through this transition to Workspace as being more of a platform, can you just talk about how you're thinking about sort of the evolution of the partner ecosystem as you guys are now starting to talk to decision makers outside just the IT universe? Traditionally, that's been an area where the tradition, the global system integrators will come in and oftentimes help sort of grease the skids in terms of helping software companies along in terms of their platform strategy. I'm just trying to get a sense on where you guys stand on that and maybe if there is any points of validation we can take away from potential partnerships that help, I think, speak to the direction you guys are heading in. Thanks.","David Henshall","Yeah. I can't talk about specific partnerships that aren't really announced publicly, but I can tell you that you're right. It was a big focus of last week talking about the overall message selling into a different set of buyers and it's a journey that we've been on for a few years. So, it hasn't been totally net new. ","However, the conversation that I had sitting down with a large group of our GSI partners was much more focused on \u2013 this is a platform, this is one that a lot of them have been engaged in in terms of helping build out micro apps and things as beta customers and whatnot because the long-term engagement with them comes from how they build unique and differentiated businesses around some of these capabilities, not just using them as a tool as part of a larger engagement, but actually as a foundation to build a practice around it. That's the direction that we would be working with them on to help become real.","So, a good engagement with GSIs, continue to work with our traditional set of partners both on new and installed base customers. So, the message was pretty holistic last week. I think we've got good alignment across our sellers. Not a transition, as you would imagine. We're moving to much more of a continuous engagement model, which is typical for a cloud company versus one that sells individual point products. But that's a journey we've been on for a while. And so, I think each and every quarter, we're getting a little bit better at it and we've got a pretty good, pretty good view of where we need to be over the course of the next couple of years.","Kirk Materne","That's helpful. Thanks very much.","David Henshall","All right. It sounds like that was the last question. So, again, I just want to wrap up and thank everybody for joining us again this afternoon. Really nice way for us to end the year, coming off a strong fourth quarter. We're, obviously, optimistic about 2020 with everything we're doing across both go-to-market and the product area. ","Look forward to speaking with many of you throughout the quarter and reporting back with our first quarter results in April. So, thank you very much and have a good night.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

My name is Doris, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Citrix Systems Third Quarter 2013 Fiscal Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce Mr. Edward [ph] Fleites, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Fleites, you may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites","Thank you, Doris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's third quarter 2013 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be David Henshall, Acting CEO and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems' Investor Relations website. The webcast will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.

A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I'd like to turn it over to David Henshall, our Acting CEO and Chief Financial Officer. David?","David James Henshall","Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us here today. As you can see from the release, overall results in Q3 were $713 million in total revenue, up 11% year-on-year; product license revenue, up 3%; cash flow from operations, up 23% year-on-year; and adjusted EPS of $0.70 a share. In addition, we closed 38 transactions greater than $1 million each, with relative strength coming from customers in the healthcare, retail and technology sectors. Geographically, we saw uneven conditions across our markets in Q3 as customers continue to be cautious with capital spending.","From a license revenue perspective, business was flat in the Americas region, slightly negative in the Pacific, while EMEA grew in the low-double digits. Clearly, we're disappointed with the financial results for Q3, coming up short of our guidance range for the first time in more than a decade. However, we remain as confident as ever in our long-term strategy and opportunity.","In my comments, I'll discuss the results in the context of our 3 primary markets, highlight the items that were below expectation in Q3 and how we're thinking about it going forward. So let's look at the results within our 3 primary businesses.","First, our Mobile and Desktop business grew 8% from last year to $381 million. This area continues to be in transition, as we've been driving the strategic conversation with customers about transforming their businesses to enable mobile work styles. The introduction of XenMobile Enterprise Edition is a catalyst for these conversations, raising the bar in enterprise mobility market with MDM, secure mobile apps, virtual apps and desktops, secure docs and mobile support as the standard. We've been leading with this solution, which began shipping about 3 months ago.","In Q3, over 2\/3 of our mobile platform customers opted for this edition, while the majority of those customers were also net new to Citrix. We're seeing the XenMobile opportunity pipeline developing at an aggressive pace, and we're very comfortable with our full year goals for this solution and strong growth into 2014. We're also accelerating the pace of product innovation. We have an important new release of XenMobile shipping this quarter, further simplifying and enhancing the user experience, integrating productivity apps and extending our competitive differentiation in the market.","However, while the total business in mobile and desktop was up 8% in Q3, we also saw a 3% year-on-year decline in license revenue. And this was driven by 2 primary factors: first, our pivot to mobile, both in terms of marketing and sales team focus. Transformation is a powerful message, generating a tremendous amount of customer interest but, in this environment, has negatively impacted our midsized transactional business for standalone desktop and app opportunities. And to address this, we're refocusing demand gen on driving more project-specific opportunities in Q4, really aligning with customer budgets and emphasizing the key attributes that had made our app and desktop virtualization solutions market leaders. This is areas like data security, compliance, ROI and secure access.","The second item has been the release of XenDesktop 7 at the end of Q2. This is a major platform transition that includes a cloud-ready infrastructure for delivering Windows apps and desktops as a service from a single, easy-to-use console. We've materially reduced installation time, accelerated app migrations, streamlined operations management and reduced the cost of ownership. But because XD7 is a new platform, I think we underestimated the impact that customer evaluations would have on our ongoing expansion business. Fortunately, we believe there's a solid multiyear product cycle ahead for customers of all sizes, as they refresh their IT architecture to support enterprise mobility and leverage hybrid and public clouds. XD7 will help them transition and transform their infrastructure to create more business agility, security and mobility. We also see XD7 further solidifying our key position in verticals like healthcare and financial services, while opening new opportunities in more specialized app markets, such as CAD, engineering and others.","As far as early momentum, we had a record quarter for new trial downloads in Q3 at more than 30,000 and just for perspective, this is about double the rate of the last major release of XenDesktop. So we expect that XD7 will drive upgrade and expansion business in 2014.","As I noted, we're making tactical adjustments in the enterprise mobility business in Q4. We have tremendous conviction in our strategic approach here though, delivering a complete enterprise mobility solution that allows customers to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility and to do it all in an integrated experience that sets Citrix apart.","So next, in our Networking and Cloud business. Total revenue increased 15% in the quarter to $146 million, with product license revenue increasing by 10%. The NetScaler products were, again, the major driver for this business. And in Q3, NetScaler's sales to enterprise customers were particularly strong, up about 30% year-on-year, while the cloud and Internet segment was slower than expected due to the timing of large orders and coming off such a strong growth quarter in June.","For a little more context on the networking business, let me touch on a few metrics in Q3. First, the cross-sell in desktop attach initiatives led to more than 500 virtualization orders that included NetScaler as part of the solution. This is up about 17% from a year ago. Also, we transacted with more than 2,100 different customers in the period, including more than 900 net new networking customers as we continue to expand the base.","From a mixed perspective, the NetScaler SDX platform represented approximately 20% of NetScaler license sales and increased well over 100% year-on-year. And following the investments that we've been making in geographic coverage, in this case, EMEA in particular, continuing to drive growth, leading to more than 30% year-on-year growth in EMEA alone. We remain bullish on the growth prospects of our Cloud and Networking business, and we expect to continue to drive share gains. Our product innovation, growing sales capacity, solutions approach and relationships with key partners like Cisco all support our optimism.","So turning to the SaaS business. Total revenue was up 14%. Our collaboration services remain the primary driver, growing 20% in Q3. We continue to innovate rapidly in this area. Like last quarter, we extended HDFaces video support for webinars. We released GoToMeeting essentials for small group meetings, and we've added new capabilities for mobile devices, like the ability to join a conference with just a single click.","Additionally, ShareFile, our data-sharing platform, continues to scale up nicely, up more than 70% from last year. Looking forward, the opportunity for ShareFile is expanding as we've addressed more enterprise requirements through innovations like StorageZones Connectors, for SharePoint, network drives, Microsoft Azure, as well as tight integrations with our enterprise mobility solutions. The early results here are strong. In fact, in Q3 alone, we closed 15 transactions for over 1,000 seats each.","Turning to operations. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 86%, down a point from a year ago, as new product license revenue reflects higher mix of networking and SaaS. We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year.","In Q3, we added about 300 new people to Citrix, as we continue to focus on expanding go-to-market reach and customer direct touch, primarily around networking. And additionally, we're investing to expand our data sharing and mobile platform teams. We do expect growth in headcount will slow down in Q4.","And finally, the adjusted tax rate in the period was 23%, up from 22% a year ago. Looking at the balance sheet, cash and investments increased to $1.7 billion at the end of September, driven by cash flow from operations, which was over $223 million or an increase of 23% from last year.","In the last period, we repurchased 800,000 shares of stock, bringing the year-to-date total to just over 2.6 million shares. And given the current market conditions, we plan to significantly accelerate our share repurchase program in Q4. Today, we announced that the board has authorized a $500 million increase to the program, and this is an addition to the nearly $180 million remaining under the prior authorization.","So turning to our current outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter 2013. Before I discuss our actual guidance for the quarter, I'd like to provide some context around our expectations. But first, we believe that it's reasonable to expect demand levels and capital spending to remain mix across our various markets. And second, that we're using conservative assumptions on the timing of pipeline closure, assuming that many customers are still in the process of evaluating our new platform releases in the Mobile and Desktop business.","We'll continue to focus on execution and delivering financial results, while investing to expand our long-term capacity, innovation and competitive differentiation across the business. So for Q4, our expectations are total revenue in the range of $800 million to $810 million and adjusted EPS of between $0.95 and $1 per share.","With respect to next year, we're currently working on the 2014 plan. And given the environment, the product transitions in process and the fact that we're still in the middle of our planning cycle, we're going to wait until the next call to provide any specific financial outlook for 2014.","But before we take questions, I'd like to address a topic that I'm sure is on everyone's mind, and that's Mark's temporary leave of absence and what it means for Citrix. The first thing I want to say is that the leave is unrelated to the business. As many of you know, Mark recently suffered a personal tragedy with the death of his son. It's obviously been extremely difficult and last week, he decided that he needs to step back from his executive responsibilities to be with his family and to give himself time to heal. All of us, the board, management, employees are fully supportive of Mark and his decision and we all want him to take the time that he needs. He will continue to serve on the board during his leave, and we do expect him to return. But there's no set schedule. Beyond that, we won't comment really any further on this out of respect for the privacy of Mark and his family. But while Mark is on leave, I'll be working closely with our management team to drive the business forward. It really has been and will continue to be our collective responsibility to execute on a day-to-day basis, and I'm highly confident we have the experience, the team and the capabilities to do that.","We intend to maintain a laser focus on customer needs. IT, as we know, it is being reshaped. Work is going mobile. Application services are being delivered from the cloud. This is really the future of IT. Citrix has the innovative products and solutions to meet the needs of our customers today and well into the future. This is how we'll capitalize on these better ways for people and IT to work, and this is why we're confident of our financial fiscal strategic plans. As we open up the call for questions, I want to let you know that I'm joined here today by Sudhakar Ramakrishna, Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Desktop and Cloud Division, who will also be available to take your questions.","So now, operator, we'll now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. First, in terms of NetScaler, can you provide some more detail on some of the -- what caused the deceleration in growth this quarter? And then, as you think about your guidance for Q4, what are you sort of implying in there for NetScaler and that cloud division? And then also back towards XenMobile, you talked about a big release coming. I think you're calling it Artemis [ph] and we've heard that it's focusing on a single-server infrastructure, MDM and mobile application management, some authentication changes too. Can you provide some more detail on that release and then how you think that's going to impact the business, especially in 2014?","David James Henshall","Thanks, Phil. Let me talk first about Networking and then ask Rama to speak specifically to the XenMobile releases that are coming up. First off, as I said in my prepared remarks, our business is really shaped into 2 primary areas: sales into the enterprise and sales into cloud-centric or Internet-centric customers. That latter portion is the one that has been really driving that outsize growth over the last few quarters, showing north of 50% product license revenue for 3 straight quarters. The other area, the enterprise, is really the place that we've been focused strategically for the last several years to really build out our capacities to service customers, that's really a coverage statement, our strategies around attach for some of our broader virtualization solutions and then, of course, working with partners like Cisco on just core ADC opportunities. So at the enterprise area, that did really well in Q3, I mentioned up about 30% year-on-year. We saw that across all primary verticals and really nothing beyond that. The attach motion to desktop, as I said, was up about 17% in terms of the volume. The actual dollars track more closely to the dollars in the underlying Desktop business. So we're really happy with where we sit right now from a, let's call it, a product technology and competition standpoint, the breadth of the solution. And then coverage is one that we're still working on. I think we've got a long ways to go in terms of just being able to service customer requirements. A good example of that is what you're seeing in EMEA, with EMEA being a -- more of a challenging geo in the aggregate. We actually grew the Networking business north of 30% year-on-year, just because we've been able to add more coverage.","Rama, do you want to talk about the XenMobile business?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Yes. Thanks, David. On the XenMobile release, it is really an extension of what we delivered last quarter as it relates to XenMobile enterprise. Our focus on the upcoming release is three-fold. One is to continue to work on simplifying end-user experiences, as it relates to setting up of mobile applications and leveraging mobile applications and mobile data. Specifically focused on mobile applications is how we integrate secure mail as an example. We've made significant strides in that application to significantly improve the performance of it, FIFO capabilities, as well as set up and performance. We also focus on integrating secured data applications for online and mobile editing of documentation and integrating productivity and collaboration capabilities, for instance, with one click using join the GoToMeeting application from our calendar application. So our continued focus is in addition to MDM -- traditional MDM, focusing on application management and information management through focus on big targeted applications like secure mail on one hand and also to expand our ecosystem by providing them the APIs required to continually add to our mobile ecosystem.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Ken Wong for Walter. On the NetScaler business, again, I mean, you guys had -- I mean, it's -- typically, Q4 is a pretty robust quarter for that -- for the Internet group. I mean, should we be expecting that you'll see that same kind of trend this coming Q4? Or are you guys dialing down expectations there?","David James Henshall","Yes. Ken, we're not breaking out expectations in our guidance by product for Q4. We just haven't done that in the last few quarters. But one thing to keep in mind, when you look at individual pieces of the business, for example, the networking products were up just under 60% growth in product license a year ago and nearly 30% sequential growth. So we had a really big Q4. As I mentioned earlier, that was the first of kind of 3 quarters that we received a large volume of orders for major cloud services build-out. So they're there in the pipeline. I think we're very optimistic about our ability to continue to take share over the long term. But the timing of specifically when those close is harder to forecast, and that's one of the reasons why we don't want to be breaking out at a product-by-product level.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And I guess, in the quarter, did you guys see any weakness come from federal?","David James Henshall","Yes. I think as everyone would expect, the fed was a little choppy. We had kept our expectations pretty much in check in that area. I'd say there's more -- probably more activity on the civilian side. Well, DOD and places like that were more focused on infrastructure and security and those types of initiatives.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had a question on mobile. If I look to this, to me, it seems there's 2 areas, sort of your product and then there's the market. Because if I look out there, there's some of your competitors who seem to have been slowing down again. Can you talk a little bit about customer behavior in terms of making tactical decisions on mobile versus strategic? And what do you think it's needed to kind of turn that towards more a strategic decision-making process, i.e. from your product as well, but also from the market -- setup in the market understanding.","David James Henshall","Yes. Raimo, this is David. At a high level, the conversation really has changed. We're driving a lot of that. I think, longer term, all CIOs recognize that it's going to be critically important to bring Windows, mobile and SaaS apps together, alongside how they think about data, data security, profile management and then doing that in a unified way so that it's a seamless experience both for IT and, of course, for the end user. And so strategically, that direction absolutely resonates. I think that where we are from a market is working our way there. Like a lot of trend transformations, they happen fairly slowly. But customers are purchasing the longer-term vision right now. There's still a lot of people buying MDM, and the #1 app out there is really around secure mail. And so when you look at the focus areas that Rama talked about the things that were driving with releases this month and into next year, it's really about making that the best experience available. And that's our focus. And at the same time, we're integrating with some of the other tools that we have, our broader solutions and then the ability over time to really bring those things together, as I mentioned before. So that's probably the way I think about the market. From an opportunity point of view, we're -- our pipeline is now measured in the few hundreds of millions of dollars, so there's a tremendous amount of interest out there. And as we bring new solutions to market, we're very focused on closing that out. So I think it will be a good year in 2014 from both the market point of view and, of course, for -- from a XenMobile point of view.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Curtis (sic) [Turits] with Raymond James.","James Wesman","It's James Wesman, sitting in for Michael. We've been hopping on calls, so I apologize if you guys covered this already. Can you just tell us what bite in Xen Enterprise inorganic contribution was in the quarter?","David James Henshall","Yes. James, we actually didn't break that out. But as you know, it's pretty modest. These are both slow businesses that are ramping at this point in time.","James Wesman","Okay. And then second, can you just talk about a little bit of color with the integrated sales around the XenDesktop and Mobile? Again, I apologize if you covered this earlier, but just some color would be helpful.","David James Henshall","Yes. James, I think that we did cover that in the remarks but I'm sure you'll see that in the transcript. But at a high level, the message around Mobile and the strategic conversation is resonating quite well. I think that the pivot in this environment, it's had a bit of an impact in our ability to drive more short-term, project-based desktop virtualization. It's one of the reasons why we are shifting a little bit of focus, demand gen and sales effort towards those things that resonate with the customer budgets that exist today, opportunities that we can close in Q4 and into next year, things like data security, secure remote access, et cetera.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm going to circle back to the NetScaler business and just ask, was the overall performance of that business consistent with your plan in the quarter?","David James Henshall","Yes. Steve, I'd say it's roughly in line. It's a -- I think, from a year-to-date point of view, that business is up north of 30%. We are ahead of plan year-to-date. The timing of the large, cloud-based orders, I'd say, are the ones that are harder to forecast and that's why there's a little bit of variability quarter-to-quarter. That's why we've talked about that over the past couple of quarters that, that's going to be a little bit lumpy because that's the shape of those transactions.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","But if we look out longer term, what would you suggest we think about the growth rate of this business, maybe on a license basis? And again, longer-term kind of smoothing out some of those larger deals, the timing on those deals?","David James Henshall","Yes. Steve, I want to be careful not to give 2014 guidance at this point because we're specifically not doing that right now. But when we look at what we've done from a market -- in a market share point of view over the last few years, we think all those trends continue to be in place: the expansions we've made from a coverage standpoint; the very, very early stage of critical partnerships like Cisco; the success we've had in cloud service. I mean, these are all trends that are well entrenched right now, going into the back half of the year and next year. So it's a way for me not to answer the question specifically, but I think that we're in a -- we're certainly confident in our ability to continue to drive share over the future periods.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And would you say that the performance this quarter is not representative of what you would hope to see the business grow longer term?","David James Henshall","Yes, I'd say that -- the only thing I'd say about that is this quarter was one that we had some weakness, as I pointed out earlier, in the Internet-centric and cloud service provider sector. The big part of that business is harder to forecast. We feel very comfortable about the directional trend of that. And so this quarter, we may have wanted that to be stronger. But overall, as I said, we're tracking extremely well year-to-date and we're optimistic looking forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First off, best wishes to Mark, if he's reading the transcript at some point in the future. And with respect to the business, we hear that VDI -- cost of VDI technology is starting to come down pretty significantly. It's starting to make sense even to mainstream organizations and plus, you got VMware that acquired the Desktone and you guys signed a large deal with a service provider the previous quarter. So all indications are that the market maybe is becoming more mainstream but much later than anybody thought. So wondering how you guys are positioned. Do you first want to agree with my assertion? Maybe I'm completely off base. And secondly, how would you go to market next year in light of the mobile product acquisition? Do you foresee having 2 separate sales force just in order to get the best out of these 2 opportunities?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Kash, this is Sudhakar. Let me comment on that and David can add on top it. So first, well, I agree with the comments that you made in terms of the economics of VDI or desktop virtualization in general, working in the industry's favor, whether it be storage cost or computing, power and cost. As you heard from David, customers are evaluating XenDesktop 7 and in some cases, that has protracted adoption. Plus, the story has become larger as it relates to enterprise mobility and bringing together of mobile applications, native mobile apps, as well Windows apps that are getting mobilized. Our focus is to continue to help customers accelerate their evaluations, continue the adoption and a great focus of XenDesktop 7 was simplicity, manageability, while continuing to deliver the security that we have come to be known for. So in regards to market expansion, we're looking at -- is you mentioned Desktone, frankly, that -- we believe that is a validation of what we have seen in the market for the last 3 years. As you know, we have over 2,600 Citrix service provider partners serving up desktops and applications using cloud technology. And we continue to accelerate and build momentum using the same base technology but cloud-enabling it. In addition to that, we are expanding the market opportunity in terms of addressable desktops that we can capture through innovations within XenDesktop 7, as it relates to specific verticals and engineering community or computer-aided design and others, which have a rich need or an expansive need for graphic acceleration and graphics performance and interactivity. So I agree with you, and these are our focus areas as we go forward. As it relates to XenMobile, we have a specialist sales team already in place. However, increasingly, our customers who are our traditional XenDesktop and app customers also tend to be our XenMobile customers. So our focus there is not only penetrating our install base, but also expanding into new customers with mobility as the front end, with expansion into the entire portfolio as we move forward.","David James Henshall","And Kash, I'd just add, the -- I mean, the strategy, of course, is striking the right balance between the long-term strategic vision for the most advanced mature customers and, of course, addressing and servicing more project-based opportunities that exist out there right now.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just finally, if I could. On The Networking business, it's rare that you have missed numbers in the Internet vertical. Is there any pause going on there, competitive share or execution, a combination of those?","David James Henshall","Yes. Kash, I wouldn't say we missed numbers because we haven't guided to that specifically. But I would say that, if you remember, we've had really large quarters over the past 9 months. Q2 is particularly strong in that area. We talked about that last quarter being up 54%, being driven a lot by some of these large transactions coming out of the cloud area and that the timing of those was inherently difficult to forecast. So we feel good about it long term, and this is just the way everybody should think about it is that segment of the business has historically been and will continue to be a little bit lumpy from a timing standpoint.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","David, sort of understanding that the sales process might have gone a little bit delayed through more customers evaluating Desktop 7 and sort of the shifting around the mobile narrative, I guess where do you think you are in terms of that process, meaning how far along are we in terms of the evaluations versus them getting back on schedule, where the pipeline was originally set? And I guess, as it relates to your fourth quarter guidance, I guess, what's in -- I guess, what have you done differently, given that it has been more choppy in terms of the conversion rates on pipeline? Because it sounds like you guys are still very positive on your overall pipeline. I guess, what are you doing in terms of the conversion rate assumptions to try to, I guess, de-risk some of that lumpiness for investors?","David James Henshall","Sure, Kirk. Yes, you're absolutely right on the desktop piece, the total piece. We feel that this is a really powerful platform that came out with XenDesktop 7, and we're bringing together for the first time a new architecture around app and desktops, the ability to deliver those seamlessly from one console, more on a -- kind of a cloud-focused architecture, if you will. But it's a challenging upgrade for customers. And existing customers that have large farms rights now are going to through a thoughtful process on how to do that. And for a typical customer, there's very few that are wall-to-wall desktop virtualization. Most of them are in some phase of projects that expand on a ordinary course of business, and that's been a land-and-expand strategy for 20 years now. And when they go through the evaluation of a new platform, that expansion business is the part that's probably most impacted. At the same time, we have released 7.1 coming out this quarter, which actually supports R2 of Windows Server 2012. That's important because it historically is a point where a lot of customers upgrade their underlying server OS. And so that's how we're thinking about it on that front. As far as the other part about the message and whatnot, the message remains the same. However, it's -- as I said earlier, it's not an either\/or when it comes to dealing with the more specific requirements like data security or BYO or secure remote access. It's both and so that's why we're transferring a little bit of focus back in Q4 and into next year on those areas, so we don't lose sight of that. As far as the guidance and what's in there, we haven't given specific numbers out around how we think about overall pipeline and pipeline coverage and closed ratios. But I will say we are, in general, consistent with my comments, being more conservative on those assumptions based on the choppiness we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And that is most specifically around the Desktop business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan.","Darren R. Jue - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Darren Jue on for John. David, in the Desktop segment, you referred to the pivot to mobile and the XenDesktop 7 transition as impacting growth in that business. But I just wanted to ask if there was anything your competitors did in the quarter that may have also impacted that business at all?","David James Henshall","No, there are nothing I can think of. I mean, this is a market that's always been competitive. No change on that front.","Darren R. Jue - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question about cash flow. It looked like collections drove a lot of the growth in the quarter. Was there anything unusual going on there? And I suppose, should we assume that there's going to be a headwind created by that next quarter?","David James Henshall","I don't really look for headwinds as much as --- cash flow was strong. Where it's up -- I mentioned earlier, it was up 23% year-on-year. Last quarter, I believe, it was up 25% year-on-year. So trailing 12 months is probably about 20%. It has been a focus, as I mentioned, several quarters ago to keep cash flow growing faster than revenue and net income. It is one of our focused areas. And so we're very fortunate to have a business with a high degree of recurring revenue, good visibility into cash flow and a very solid and clean balance sheet.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","David, just following up on your recent comments. You mentioned that XenDesktop 7 is a challenging upgrade for customers. What are the chance for competition to try and displace you? And in other words, is it challenging enough for customers to look at other alternatives as they go through the upgrade process?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Yes. This is Sudhakar. I'll address that. XenDesktop 7 is actually one of the, I would say, a groundbreaking release in terms of simplicity and manageability, while maintaining all of the benefits. And in fact, we have simplified the architecture greatly by combining it up for desktop and apps. So in that sense, it's actually a highly competitive and very easy installation process. In fact, we can get customer serving up desktops within a matter of minutes. The point that David was highlighting was about these large customers that have actually multiple releases of XenDesktop and then app in the same network across various server farms. Graduating them to XenDesktop 7 is actually a slow process because they have to, not only qualify XenDesktop 7, but actually go through the migration of several discrete farms. And that's what actually results in some protraction for existing customers.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And Sudhakar, just a quick follow-up, can you talk about what's causing the slower uptake of mobility solutions? If you can talk about the customer decision process. Do you normally have to replace somebody there? How long do you think some of these proof of concepts around evaluations are going to go on before we start seeing meaningful uptake of those solutions? That's it for me.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So in terms of displacing others, we take a lot of pride in actually working with the installed base of a customer to the degree that they have CD [ph] units [indiscernible] in. Many of the prior customers have small number of MDM seats and so on and so forth. We're not really expecting them to change out or drop out as we coexist with them and we help expand that. The message that is really resonating with our customers as it relates to mobility is not just about MDM as much as mobile application management and information management, coresident with mobilizing Windows applications themselves. So when they look at an enterprise-wide strategy, they're not looking at it from XenDesktop and apps or VDI perspective alone, but broadly speaking, enterprise mobility management in total. And so that's really what's getting customers excited about our strategy, and that's also what's contributing, let's say, to some of these evaluation cycles that David mentioned.","David James Henshall","And Abhey, I'll just mention on top of that, that this business is ramping ahead of the expectations that we laid out originally. So we're comfortable with where we are. We always like to go faster. And I think that, because we're on such a rapid pace of innovation there in bringing new releases to market every few months, this helps to address whatever customer issues there are out there, that are slowing things down. And so we feel good about where we are and certainly going into 2014.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","On the telco side of the business and if you specifically look at ByteMobile, are you seeing much pull-through there, relative to NetScaler? And just, how is ByteMobile transitioning overall? How should we think about that in what historically, I think, is a strong fourth quarter for that business unit?","David James Henshall","Yes. Let me start out, and then I'll ask Sudhakar to follow on here. So I'll tell you, just in general, the ByteMobile business is maybe on track to what we have thought in terms of dollar contribution. We're probably a little bit behind in building out the go-to-market motion from where we'd like to be. As you know, selling into a carrier is a different beast. It's a longer sales cycle. The deals are large and the deals are infrequent, and they tend to be multiyear in nature. But we've got a good pipeline opportunity of what we call new logos. The timing, of course, is very hard to predict, but they're out there and we're ramping well. As far as ByteMobile as a product, we have a new release called 7, which -- ByteMobile 7, which is shipping this quarter, enables mobile operators to really differentiate service by managing things like Internet radio traffic and User Experience Indexing and some pretty cool features there that will add value to their networks. So it's early for us. It's an early segment and one that, I think, we'll keep focusing on into next year.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Rob, I had a couple of comments to that. Release 7 actually has a lot of features that continue to expand what's called the wireless spectrum efficiency and optimization that we've been delivering in the ByteMobile context to our customers. We've also added capabilities to help them meet and rate their users more effectively, thereby enabling them to deliver differentiated business models. So that's on the ByteMobile stuff. There is a level of NetScaler attach related to ByteMobile deployments. However, the main focus on NetScaler is, call it, supporting telco data centers, which typically tends to be different buyers within the same telco. But we're using our ByteMobile presence, ByteMobile sales teams and the broader proposition that they're delivering to gain additional traction on the broader NetScaler portfolio gives us. So there's some limited attach as it relates to ByteMobile directly. And then there is also a focus on expanding into their data centers.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then, Sudhakar, on the Mobile and Desktop side, and Citrix has relatively broad portfolio, which -- you're newer to the company. Is there the natural synergies there that we think? And are there further steps that you really need to take to do more integration to make it more consumable and improve velocity? Or are they playing out to be more discrete categories that end customers are looking at?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So Rob, that's actually an excellent question and this is a focus area for us. As we bring to bear, not only Windows apps and mobile apps, but also Saas applications in the future. So while we've made our mark with serving up desktops and applications in a Windows environment, we're quickly integrating and expanding to mobile applications, as well as SaaS through common and unified architectures and experiences.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions. The first one was, how do you guys see the R2 release of Windows Server impacting your sales cycle, if at all, if it had an impact this past quarter? And there's a lot of concern in the market that this is also going to impact your growth going forward as well. So I'm just wondering if you guys could share your thoughts there. And I guess, David, for you, the guide -- I think I'm getting as to what -- the guide's a little bit higher than what we normally see in terms of the sequential growth for Q4. So can you talk about your confidence level and how your conversations with customers might be changing versus a 4 to weeks -- 4 weeks to 6 weeks ago when they were more cautious.","David James Henshall","Sure. Let me take the second part of that first. In terms of sequential model and whatnot, we are, as we always have, we focus on more of a bottoms-up approach to guidance and then pipelines and forecast and whatnot. And that's just because the nature of the businesses is changing. I think the last year on sequential total revenue, we were up 15%, I believe, maybe 16%. Our current guidance would be more like 12% to 14%. So well, probably relative...","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. You really peaked last year, right, in Q4? I think that's the question I'm getting as you guys ended up crushing your guidance. So usually, you guys guide a little bit more conservatively.","David James Henshall","Well, we felt like this is a conservative guide, Heather. And that's based on where we are.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's perfect. And then the third question...","David James Henshall","In terms -- sure. In terms of R2, I mean, the important thing to remember is that Microsoft has been a terrific partner for 20 years and a lot of what we do on the app and desktop side is embrace and extend the platform. And Server 2012, being a powerful platform, a lot of companies are in their eval or starting to adopt. And it's usually -- now we're looking back historically, choosing the R2 release of the server OS that has accelerated adoption for over many generations. And so there's no reason for us to expect that it's any different now. And that's also based on customer conversations.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, I just wanted to go back and not to dwell in Q3. But from the pipeline, did you see those deals that's -- those were late-stage deals. Are you anticipating those to come back into Q4? And was there -- I know you mentioned the kind of the desktop and mobile, but any color as it relates to the geography? Where you saw those deals slipped, is it across the board or centered in one region?","David James Henshall","Sure, Brent. It's -- a deal slippage is one of those things that we always want to be a little hesitant with when we talk about it because opportunities do move in and out of every quarter. I'd say from a market standpoint, it was a fairly challenging environment in many markets. I think customers who have been more focused on tactical projects, fairly similar to last quarter, but very similar to a year ago in Q3. If I start breaking it down by regions, EMEA was mixed by some region, relatively weaker in western and northern areas. However, NetScaler, as I mentioned before, doing really well, up more than 30% year-on-year as we've just been increasing the investments there. It's like a proof point that we got a lot of runway. APAC, more emerging markets. They were, I'd say, most challenging and that was across the board. And in the U.S., fed, as we've talked about briefly, Latin America and so in the broader Americas region and then the western area. That was probably the most impacted. I'd say, if I had to characterize Q3, it was one where the -- there's was a -- probably a falloff in expectation very late in the quarter. And it was just focused on a lack of urgency for customers to initiate capital spending. That's the cleanest definition. And as far as opportunities coming back in, yes, sure. There are at least a handful of million-dollar opportunities that had slipped and have closed already. But that isn't too dissimilar to a normal quarter. So I'd be careful just reading too much into that.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one clarification on Mobile. I believe you gave some high-level expectations you thought for the year. Can you just update us on your financial expectation for the Mobile business for the -- this fiscal year?","David James Henshall","We do. We said the contribution from the mobile platforms would be at least $30 million of total revenue, and we feel very comfortable with that number at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Back on the Networking side of the business, I'm sort of curious. I don't think you guys talked much about the virtual appliance in your prepared remarks, and I was just wondering if you could update us on the type of traction you're seeing with that. I know that a lot of the partners that we speak to are excited about. But I know it's also something that some of your traditional competitors are also beginning to invest a lot more. And so if you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on what you're seeing in that part of the business, that'd be great.","David James Henshall","Yes. I think the virtual appliances are doing extremely well. I mean, we didn't -- I didn't break it out in the prepared remarks. But in terms of bookings dollars, it's still smallest of the 3 major areas, but it was up north of 40% year-on-year. The great thing about the virtual appliances, they just provide so much more flexibility for customers to utilize those types of capabilities at different parts of the apps stack. Think about it as almost creating more of an app fabric to be able to integrate with our more hardware-based appliances. The other thing that we haven't talked about is the release of Citrix NetScaler 1000V by Cisco, which is a virtual appliance, and that's only an OEM arrangement and that just went live in the last couple of weeks, so just getting more and broader market coverage and more opportunity to get that technology into more customers. Sudhakar, anything you'd add to that?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","No, I think you've covered it all. The -- we are quite excited about Cisco's release of Cisco NetScaler 1000V as well. And it's a continuation of our focus on virtualization and providing customers options, be it 100% software-only, as well as, in some cases, hardware-based solutions or appliance-based solutions, I should say.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then maybe just talking to some of those larger Internet and cloud deals that you talked about maybe being pushed out a little bit. Were there any of that were lost to competitors? Or are they all still in the pipeline and just a matter of timing when some of those might come back in?","David James Henshall","No, there was nothing from a competitive standpoint that's changed. It's just timing. It's simply focused on when a lot of these big companies need incremental capacity. And remember, we have really strong growth coming out the last 3 quarters in a row from this vertical. So for it to come back a little bit just on timing is not a big deal in our minds.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A little bit of a follow-up to Kash's question on the refocusing of demand gen. How quickly, David, do you think you can pivot and start seeing some positive results from this? And also, do you view it as more of a temporary or permanent shift in go to market?","David James Henshall","Well, 2 things: one, the strategic direction. We have absolute confidence in that and probably more confidence than ever based on customer conversations about the need to really bring together apps of all types -- data, security profile, et cetera. That's just the way people are going to need to consume applications downstream. So we feel good there. The challenge for us as a company, of course, is just making sure that it's not an either\/or. So when we talk about re-vectoring some demand gen and focus, that's -- beginning late last quarter, continue through this quarter and into next year. So we can certainly have a modest impact in Q4, but really just setting us up more as we start thinking about the first half of next year.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you also talked about the 1000V. I wanted to ask about that because I also saw the SKU, it did live for a couple of weeks now. Can you talk about your expectations, particularly for 2014, just given the recent enhancements on the technical integration side, as well as go to market as well?","David James Henshall","No. Actually, we really can't talk about expectations for next year. We haven't given anything for next year right now. But as Sudhakar mentioned, there's a lot of great things going on with partners like Cisco, not just on 1000V, but with the tight integrations that we have with Nexus 7000. We've -- we haven't talked about but continue to do a great joint business with desktop virtualization on UCS. Now that we're part of -- a component of Cisco-validated designs, that helps a lot with customers when we're talking about ADC migration opportunities. So it's multifaceted and a lot of good things going on.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets.","Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","With Mobile and Desktop, could you just talk about what the sales force is in terms of capacity? I mean, it seems that you have the right guys in the right places, just talk about where they are in the ramping process, given the product transition.","David James Henshall","Yes, I think we're relatively early on. I mean, for our internal teams, as Sudhakar mentioned, we do have specialists that are very focused on Mobile. But it's also highly related sales to our generalist teams. And so I think we've got good leverage there and that will keep getting better all the time. And from a partnership or a partner contribution, traditional resellers, yes, it's ramping. I don't have the numbers in front of me, specifically how many partners are certified. But it is a nice related sale to those that have the skills to sell virtualization already. So I'd say it's a work in process, like every new product and market launch for us, but it's getting progressively stronger each and every quarter.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","And just to add to that, not only in terms of pure heads, but we are also focused intensely on readiness and training both of our internal sales team as well as our partners, just to help us scale better and more effectively going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions. So the first one is, given your tight relationship with Microsoft, how do see clients moving to Azure having effect -- I mean, historically, they are -- like the new version of server has helped you, do you think moving to Azure has a similar type of lift effect to you?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So we -- as you mentioned, we are close partners with Microsoft and we've been working on delivery of desktops and applications from -- in the Azure architecture with Microsoft. I'd say it's fairly early days in terms of actually defining the architecture, much less actually talking about the rollout plan and such. But my belief is that our continued partnership will help us leverage the cloud as another delivery vehicle to expand overall addressable market for us.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Excellent. And then the Mobile side, relating to partners, et cetera, do you see that you have the right fit? Do you feel you're going to need to significantly change or expand the partners that are going to drive the newer mobile Offerings?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","No, we feel good about the level of partnerships that we have and the partners that we have. As we mentioned, it's a fairly new product to the company and to the market. And the proposition that we have is truly unique and differentiated. So there's a lot of focus on readiness and training, as I mentioned, and helping our sales team, as well as our partners scale more effectively.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So you say, there's going to be a lot more ramping that you're still going to have to do, but the clients are the right guys.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","I mean, this is going to be an ongoing process because we continue to expand our ecosystem as well. But we feel good about where we are. As David highlighted, we feel good about the results in 2013, as well as our continued prospects into 2014. So it's not so much a ground-up effort as much as an expansion and an extension effort.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Zeller with Needham & Company.","Robert Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to go back to NetScaler and just ask housekeeping. I know we were told that license for the networking [indiscernible] up 10% year-on-year. Should we assume the NetScaler license was roughly the same performance? I don't believe it's called out.","David James Henshall","Yes, I said license was up 10% year-on-year.","Robert Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","For NetScaler as well, typically?","David James Henshall","Yes.","Robert Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And then I'll try again on calendar '14. I know you're not offering official guidance. But how should we think about the investments and the change in sales strategy for Mobile versus margins for next year?","David James Henshall","Yes, I'll tell you what. I mean, like I said earlier, I mean, we are in the middle of our planning cycle right now. We've got new leadership across the product businesses. We're very confident that we'll have a really complete plan going into next year. And one that strikes the right balance between both long- and shorter-term strategic initiatives, like in -- really like our markets, our competitive position and our focus. But it's just not appropriate to provide specific guidance until we get further along in the process. So as we exit next quarter, we'll be able to able lay that out with a lot of specificity.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","If you can just comment on the size of the deals you're experiencing on the Mobile side, are they tending to be smaller in size, suggesting perhaps you may be seeding the market now and maybe you got an opportunity for more follow-on larger deals next year? And also, F5 has just commented that they say a win rate of about 90% and no pricing pressure. I'm just curious whether you saw anything -- I think I heard you gave earlier, you say no change in competitive [indiscernible]. But specifically on the NetScaler side, is there any change in the dynamics you're seeing in the market there?","David James Henshall","Yes. Rick, let me start with the latter part. I can't really speak to the win-loss rate. I mean, I'd say that from a numbers point of view, our business and what would be traditional ADC\/load balance is doing extremely well. That's the enterprise side. That's the part that was up 30% year-on-year last quarter. So I think we were positioned really well competitively. And as we have more and more coverage, we have the ability to engage in that many more conversations with customers. And then, of course, partnerships and others help to aid that at the same time. I will say that it's been a highly price-competitive market over the last several quarters from a number of vendors and that -- we should expect that to continue into the future. We differentiate based on our architecture, our approach to Pay-Grow and other more, call it, enterprise-friendly features; and then, of course, with platforms as being able to bring forth both the core MDX, virtual MPX and SDX, which is the big consolidation opportunity. So that's how I think about the NetScaler component of the business. In terms of Mobile, one thing for everybody to keep in mind is that we've been in the market now for only 3 months with a enterprise edition of XenMobile, really changing the whole story, and in the MDM -- kind of the MDM space. It is very early days at this point. I think most of the opportunities we're seeing and we're closing tend to be smaller in nature. These are customers that are rolling out 100, 500, maybe 1,000 seats at the high end. And so we're just getting started there. From an ASP standpoint, as you'd imagine, this is a smaller sale than a broad desktop virtualization sale. But the strategy longer term, of course, is how we bring these things together, how important it is to support Windows, Mobile, SaaS and other apps together in one unified solution that has the context around data, data security profile management, et cetera. And so longer term, that's exactly the direction we're going.","Operator",".","Our next question is from the line of Ed Maguire from CLSA.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just discuss the long-tail aspect to the desktop business? It's been now well over like 3.5 years since we've seen this broad Windows 7 upgrade and that's starting to tail off. Windows 8 has not lived up to a lot of expectations. And I was wondering if you could comment on what impact you've seen that -- sort of that broad shift having on your business and whether some of the broader confusion, I think, that's been in the market around the enterprise adoption of Windows 8 is also having impact on your desktop business.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","And so I wouldn't characterize it necessarily as a long tail as much as our ability to support heterogeneity, even from a Windows release standpoint. As you know, there's been a huge install base of XP out there in the marketplace. And we make our mark by supporting and providing support for multiple releases of Windows, multiple versions of Windows and applications. However, the conversations are shifting more towards mobilizing Windows apps, regardless of the release, as well as enterprise mobility at large, including our XenMobile application management and information management. And so that's really where we see the opportunity, in addition to expanding the footprint by providing different delivery mechanisms, such as the cloud and also different application possibilities, which expand our addressable market, going back to the reference I made about engineering and CAD-related applications. So that's how we are seeing the market evolution from an overall opportunity size standpoint.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross Macmillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","David, I actually had a couple of financial questions. The first is, when you think about Q3 and the shortfall relative to your plan, would you describe it all as a product shortfall? And the reason I ask is that we've seen some deceleration in license updates and maintenance, which have been growing sequentially very rapidly, and I was just curious as to whether something has changed there, apart from this sort of no cone [ph] effect from lower products and license growth?","David James Henshall","Yes. Ross, your last comment is exactly right. It's simply just a relationship of lower product sales in that area over a period of time. So as that catches up, we've seen the deceleration in license updates and maintenance and that should be expected. I will say that underneath that, we're doing some things that continue to increase the value we're providing the customers and hence, say, the ASP of those, trying to move them to more of a integrated solution for maintenance and staying closer to customers. We have a much more direct touch. The other area that gets impacted when new license sales are a bit muted is professional services. So PS was only up about 9% year-on-year in Q3. That's a direct reflection of 2 things: one is the Mobile and Desktop -- well, really, the Desktop business a little slower than we like; and also, systems integrators. We had a great contribution from SIs last quarter. They were 15% to 20% of total product bookings, up more than probably 25% year-on-year. And they're driving a lot of the traditional integration and the PS work at the same time. So partners like IBM, HP, Fujitsu, Dimension Data, these are all driving some of the very large strategic transactions.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then just one follow-up. On the OpEx, it was down 5% sequentially. Were there some adjustments, some accrual reversals for the reduction in the top line guidance? Or any other items in there that would have driven that larger-than-seasonal decline?","David James Henshall","Yes. Ross, no accrual adjustments per se. I mean, what you see going into Q3 is usually a lack of period costs. Q2 tends to be highlighted by some of our major events like Synergy and Summit, so those are not necessarily there. And then, of course, the related travel and entertainment goes along with that. Q3 tends to be a vacation quarter, so maybe the vacation accrual comes down a little bit. And also, just variable selling costs and those types of things that are variable with revenue and bookings do come down. But in the aggregate, we've been very focused on cost managements, on profitability. And we want to keep an eye on margins, of course, going forward as we transition through a number of these businesses.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And maybe if I could squeeze one last in, just on desktop-as-a-service. What do you think are the barriers to broader adoption of desktop-as-a-service? Because it strikes me that the service provider market has the opportunity to really drive down cost per unit or cost per desktop because they have to scale economies across multiple customers. What are the hurdles to desktop-as-a-service being more broadly adopted?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","First of all, that's exactly our perspective, that is service providers, both Citrix service providers and larger telco, for instance, can be excellent vehicles to deliver desktop-as-a-service. And our estimation is that it will be at least $600 million market by itself in the next few years. As it relates to barriers to entry, we believe we have overcome or circumvented a lot of the traditional barriers to entry for this. For instance, we have cloud-enabled our platforms. We have created multi-tenancy capabilities, simplified installation and experiences and provided our customers the business tools necessary to both deploy, as well as monitor, manage and charge their customers. The industry at large is in fairly early stages as it relates to delivering these capabilities as a service, and we were one of the first ones to start it. We did it around 2009, and we have a significant traction in that space, as well as continue to extend our lead of its capabilities, like the ones that we added to XenDesktop 7 and on a go-forward basis. And as you noticed, our competition is coming into this space as well, further validating the market potential. But it's not so much a barrier to entry as much as the technology has been addressed, and it's now a matter of scaling the market and maturing the market to realize its full potential.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Richard Williams with Cross Research.","Richard T. Williams - Cross Research LLC","I wonder if you could just talk about the differences between the SaaS business in Europe and Asia compared to the U.S. markets?","David James Henshall","The SaaS business is largely U.S.-based at this point in time. And I -- and that's just a historical basis and so 80-plus-percent is being driven out of North America. That's fairly consistent. We have had a focus to drive more of an international expansion over the past couple of years, but it's really a U.S.-based business. No discernible trends across the markets than I can really point out. For us, SaaS is about 2 primary markets. It's about collaboration, where we're doing really well. We're driving north of 20% growth in that recurring item and in data sharing, both in terms of a product and as a platform. I've mentioned earlier that ShareFile is growing north of 70% year-on-year. We're expanding opportunities, and we're doing some really cool things with integrations across the rest of our products and frankly, other solutions to allow customers to think about data in a secure but cloud-based way. And so, excited about what we have going on there.","So I think that's all the time we have for questions today. As I said earlier, we're really excited about the future. We think we've got a tremendous set of product solutions as we enter 2014. I want to use this opportunity to really thank the Citrix teams around the world, our partners and our customers. And thanks, again, for everyone joining the call today. Goodbye.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Traci Tsuchiguchi, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Traci Tsuchiguchi","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's first quarter 2019 earnings call. Participating on this call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jessica Soisson, Interim Chief Financial Officer.","This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems' Investor Relations website, and a webcast replay will be posted immediately following the call. Please note that we have posted our first quarter earnings memo to our Investors Relations website. This memo replaces the prepared verbal comments accompanying earnings slide deck and supplemental web information.

A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of our earnings memo and press release.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to David, our President and Chief Executive Officer.","David Henshall","Thanks Traci, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Hopefully, everybody has had a chance to read through our quarterly result summary and all the new disclosures that we\u2019re going to be breaking out going forward. The idea here of course is designed to really simplify the understanding of our business and the success across our subscription model transition.","Before we get started, though, I want to welcome Jessica Soisson to the call. Now, you know, she\u2019s my long-term colleague, our current Chief Accounting Officer, and as Traci said, Interim CFO as Drew is leaving to pursue other opportunities. So, as you saw in the summary, we had a really good quarter. We exceeded forecast on both revenue and EPS.","And frankly, can boil it down into three key areas. First one is that the strength is coming from the Workspace. Workspace revenue in total was up 13% year-on-year. It's the fastest growth we\u2019ve seen in many-many years.","Second is that total SaaS revenues for the Company was up 43% and this was due to the strength of our ongoing subscription bookings. In fact, the strength of subscription drove future commitment revenue which consists of deferred and unbilled up 21% from last year. In fact, the subscription mix is running ahead of plan and I expect that to be the case throughout the year.","Third item is, as we've talked about a couple of times, the strategic service provider customers really those three historically largest hyperscale networking customers just continue to be a headwind to revenue due to timing. We expect this to persist into the second quarter as I\u2019ve previously stated.","However, when you exclude these three SSP customers, revenue for the rest of the Company was just under $700 million which is up 10% year-over-year. So all-in just really happy with the performance of the quarter.","And so, now, let\u2019s open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Thank you so much David and we really appreciate. I think everybody really appreciate the new disclosures. So thank you for giving us that. I wanted to take a look -- you mentioned Workspace services revenue grew, the fastest you have seen since 2012. Can you talk about kind of how you see the durability of that type of growth rate? What seems to be causing it? And if you had to give us take for the year, how would you say you think that business evolved? And then I have a follow-up.","David Henshall","Sure, I'd say overall, the business is continuing the trends that we have seen over the last, probably the last 6, 8 quarters in raw now. I mean, more specifically, we have been talking about the Workspace in broader terms than we ever had in the past. I mean, we created virtualization years and years ago. We still have an amazing business in that area. But what's really resonating with customers is the broader vision around providing a holistic workspace for all application types, whether those are virtualized, SaaS, mobile, and really making that something that can help engage employees, drive productivity, simply the infrastructure et cetera.","And so, that's a lot of what we have been talking about. And we're getting a lot of great response from customers, that's allowed us to sign more and more up for longer term subscription deals, generate a higher number of large enterprise deals. And so, we feel good about it. Right now, we have got, I'd say, the amount of revenue coming from subscriptions is significantly higher than that of perpetual license and that should continue. The growth rate will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter just based on mix. It\u2019s still -- whether it's perpetual license or on premise term that can tend to have a little higher rev rec. So, directionally, it's up and right but I would expect it to bounce around a little bit along that trend.","Heather Bellini","And then just follow-up question is just related to the revenue outlook looks like it was a little bit better than the midpoint, the midpoint was a little bit better than the consensus. I noticed though it looks like the earnings forecast that you are giving is a little bit below and I apologize, if you might have said this earlier. But like, is there anything that you could talk to us about that might be impacting the margin in the second quarter?","David Henshall","No, we are in the full year, still expecting full year guidance of about 4% top line growth, margin up to about $32.6 of EPS. And I'd say the only thing that I'm thinking about in terms of the full year is that, subscription mix is running hotter toward subscription, so that caused us a little bit of headwind. Specific to Q2, we've never given 2Q guidance before.","Heather Bellini","Yes.","David Henshall","Q2, if you look back over the last couple of years, tends to be our lowest margin quarter because it is our highest expense quarter. And the reason that is, Q2 has a lot of seasonal items like our big synergy conference, that's when we do merit increases. And correspondingly, that's our highest marketing quarter historically. So, it tends to pop and then come back down in Q3 and Q4. And I would expect that to be the case in this year as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks and good quarter guys. I guess I wanted to dig into the SSP business, and I understand the lumpiness of it. But I guess it's been under pressure for four quarters in a raw now and considering who the customers are, you would think that they won't hold up on large purchases for such a long time. So help me get my hands around your visibility there and how do you get a sense that there isn't a bigger issue with those customers? Have they moved to elsewhere, developed their own, moved to another vendor? How do you get a sense and confidence that that's not the reason for the weakness?","David Henshall","Yes, I want to put a couple of things in context as we are talking about, just so you understand. So, when we are talking about the SSP business, let me remind everybody, it's about 3% of total revenue. It's not a big number, but it is subject to both cyclical and secular pressures. Cyclically, it's lumpy and it's always been that way. If you look at last year, there was about $100 million business in the first half of the year and $50 million in the second half, and the year prior it had similar lumpiness.","And so, as I've stated many times over the years, we have pretty good visibility into the full year, but the quarterization is a little harder. And that's the primary reason why we're going to break it out going forward. And so that everybody can look past, there is a lot of clarity to understand, when it's hurting and where it's contributing to quarter. So, on the broader secular trend, yes, it's been declining at rate of about 10% for several years now. And so, it's very consistent with the way we have talked about it, and that's just the normal scaling that the three big hyperscales are going to have.","Ittai Kidron","And then as a follow-up, you've talked about how early you are in the subscription position at a networking business and it's predominantly still hardware. Although, I was surprised with the new disclosure, and again, thanks like Heather, that is great to see that already it\u2019s 25% of the product revenue within networking -- of booking, I am sorry, subscription bookings. Help me think about the pace by which you think you can pivot networking business into subscription? Should we look at the Workspace transition as a good proxy for the pace where which this would move or given the high hardware mix here, it should take longer to get to the same levels?","David Henshall","Yes, two things. One, it's definitely going to go slower than Workspace. Workspace is a software product and it's a much more natural transition there. On networking, I think that's important to think a little bit of step back and think about strategically what we're driving. I mean, we're a software company by nature. That's what we do. And so, our approach to networking has been to really disaggregate the functionality from the hardware appliance itself and that's always been the strategy.","But giving customers that flexibility to consume networking hardware in the form factor of a hardware appliance, a virtual appliance as a container and in some instances as a service, and sharing capacity in some instances across those different types of form factors. That's really our strategy to be able to address a number of -- let's call it different secular trends that are going in networking entirely. So, it will continue to move more toward software. I think that should be the expectation, but it will be more gradual than on the Workspace business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Michael Turits","Back at Workspace, David, how much of a boost have you been getting from the Windows 10 transition, which isn\u2019t really getting towards its end? And are you at all concerned about incremental competition in the desktop as a service market from either Azure or AWS? And what's your strategy there?","David Henshall","Yes, two things. I mean if you think about Windows 10, I mean it's one of the drivers. I'd say that the platform drivers are less in these days than they would have been five years ago. And that's simply because most of the use cases that I talked to customers about tend to be around security or enabling mobility or enabling workforce productivity. It\u2019s those types of things, but it also includes platform evolution. So, I\u2019d say that that\u2019s one of many.","In terms of DaaS, we actually don\u2019t compete in DaaS today. We\u2019ve announced that we are building a DaaS product on top of our Azure Virtual Desktop, which we\u2019ll talk about a little bit later in the year. But it\u2019s a different category than we've competed in historically. We do think it\u2019s important. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re doing this natively on top of Microsoft.","We\u2019re actually becoming a cloud service provider so that we can bundle certain capabilities in the infrastructure together with our solution, the idea to really focus on customer simplicity and simplification. And that\u2019s going to be our strategy going forward. We\u2019ve been embracing and extending the Microsoft platform for 30 years now. I think we\u2019ll continue to do that especially in new categories like DaaS that are just new opportunities going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thanks for taking my question and thanks again for the extra disclosure for me as well. And David, just more an accounting question, can you talk a little bit about to the cash flow in Q1? And just talk us through the impact that the subscription transition has on the cash flow seasonality here and going forward?","David Henshall","Yes, cash flow is the area that you\u2019re going to have to look at in conjunction like future committed revenue because our billing -- kind of our billing cycles are changing as we go through this. And it's the same as we\u2019ve talked about for a long-long time. I mean as we go to book SaaS contracts, the typical contract is a three years of total contract value annualized billings.","And that\u2019s what\u2019s building this unbilled deferred that we\u2019re disclosing. That unbilled increased by about $300 million year-over-year. In a historical model, we would build all that upfront. So it\u2019s just the timing conversation more than anything else. Remind everybody that total future committed revenue that was up to about $2.1 billion now, grew 21% year-on-year.","Raimo Lenschow","And then, one follow-up. If you think about the CFO transition, obviously, we wish Drew all the best back on the West Coast. What\u2019s the timeframe that you\u2019re thinking about?","David Henshall","He'll be leaving immediately.","Raimo Lenschow","I know. And so you start the search now already.","David Henshall","Yes, we\u2019ll start to search shortly, but Jessica has been my colleague for a long time we\u2019re not going to miss a beat here as we go forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jerry Diao","Hi this is Jerry Diao filling in for Phil. Congratulations on the strong first quarter. I just want to build upon Heather's question and your comments on, how Workspace has evolved? Could you give some specific color on kind of what\u2019s precisely driving this reacceleration in terms of whether its sales reengagement or just customer better understand the new functionality et cetera? Thank you so much.","David Henshall","Sure, Jerry. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s very consistent with the strategy that we\u2019ve been talking about now for year and a half to two years. It's about thinking about the Workspace much more broadly than simply virtualization and that allows us to address really all customers in a way that -- we talk about this kind of general purpose and what that means is. It\u2019s the opportunity to expand beyond traditional virtualization in the installed base.","And think about providing customers with the platform upon which automation, security, analytics can reside that provides value even to the users that have really light application use, including those who don't need any virtualization whatsoever. So, all applications, all potential seats inside of an account really anywhere in the world et cetera. And that overall core message is resonating with customers and I think that's allowed us to re-engage and start accelerating that business over the past couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open.","Brad Reback","David, can you give us a sense of what the Americas growth rate look like ex the SSP business? Thanks.","David Henshall","No, we haven't broken it out ex SSP. We're going to try and keep the level of breakout at a pretty high level. I mean, if you look at the memo, you will see that the international geos both grew double-digits. Workspace, I mean, SSP was really the influence of course on the Americas. Those are really pretty much all in the Americas and that's been the case over the last two quarters.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to David Henshall.","David Henshall","Okay, that was awfully quick. I guess the memo and the new format is doing its job of providing this incremental level of information that we're asking for. So, I really just want to thank everyone again for joining us today.","Overall, as I said, we're very happy with how the business performed in Q1 and expect to continue, driving our subscription transition throughout the year. Hopefully many of you are joining us at our Annual Synergy Conference in May or at least tuning in, in June to our Analyst Meeting. Thank you, again.

Participating on the call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Coyle, Interim Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems' Investor Relations website. The webcast replay will be posted immediately following the call. Before we begin, this presentation does not reflect the transition impact of ASC 606 adoption which is effective January 1, 2018. Also we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website.","I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.","Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the company's filings with the SEC.

Mark?","Mark Coyle","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We have positive results across the business. Every geography grew and every business line grew as well, our transition cloud is accelerating. As you can see from the release, Q4 results from continuing operations were solid. Revenue was up 6%. Adjusted operating margin was 40%. Adjusted EPS was $1.66 a share and deferred revenue increased a 11% year-on-year.","In Q4, we closed 107 transactions of greater than $1 million with strength in healthcare, financial services, technology and government. There was good balance across the portfolio with over 80% of these deals coming from workspace services and the balance from networking. Geographically, 4Q revenue grew by 8% in the Americas, 10% in APJ while EMEA grew 1%.","Next, looking into Q4 results within our primary businesses. Our workspace services business was up 4% year-on-year to $479 million with product license and SaaS also up 4% year-on-year, a few dynamics worth noting. In the quarter, the contribution from the subscription contracts was about 40% of product bookings within the workspace business. We have strong growth of CSP subscriptions where total revenue in this area grew 37% year-on-year with an ARR now at approximately $115 million as this channel opens up new markets for us.","And we continue to see good results from the customer success services program to redefine software maintenance programs we announced in the beginning of 2017 helping to drive strong growth in our deferred revenue. In the networking business, we\u2019re seeing really good growth across the product line. The investments in sales capacity and organic innovation are paying off. Networking revenue increased 7% year-on-year in the quarter to $215 million with license revenue up 7% year-on-year, mostly coming from a low double-digit growth in NetScaler ADC and SD-WAN. ","Finally, our total content revenue was up about 20% year-on-year to $40 million in the quarter. While content makes up the majority of the total SaaS revenue, demand for our other Citrix Cloud delivered services is accelerating, building contractual backlog from long-term deals with annual billings. When we include revenue coming from SaaS and other subscription-based offerings like CSP subscription, the aggregate ARR was over $350 million in Q4. We expect the trend will accelerate in 2018 as more of our portfolios can sum as a service in the Citrix Cloud.","Turning to operations. In Q4, adjusted op margin was 40%, up 412 basis points from last year. Cash flow from operations was $254 million, bringing the full year over $960 million. Deferred revenue increased to $1.86 billion, up 11% from last year due to the strength of Customer Success Services and subscription based sales. ","Exiting Q4 we had $2.7 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, which was up 7% year-on-year. In the quarter, we issued a $750 million 10 year note in order to fund the ASR program as the first phase of our $2 billion capital return program. So the expectations for private option and subscription-based sales to increase as a percentage of a mix and with the expected effects of the recent tax legislation, we expect that the full year of 2018 revenue between $2.86 billion and $2.88 billion adjusted operating margin of 29% to 30%.","Adjusted EPS of $4.80 to $4.90 per share. For Q1, we expect revenue between $670 million and $680 million and adjusted EPS of $1.03 to $1.06 per share. Now I would like to turn it over to David to give further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward.","David Henshall","Thank you, and welcome everyone. As Mark noted, Q4 is a great quarter, delivering strong financial results while at the same time aggressively driving operational transformation across the company in our go-to-market. I'm really proud how the team executed throughout all this change really without missing a beat. More importantly, partners and our customers are really embracing the new subscription model, driving a faster conversion story than even I had hoped for, jumpstarting the multiyear plan that we discussed in October.","Despite the headwinds from the mix shift, reported numbers were still really strong, extending the second half reground across all major metrics. Let me add a little bit more color again on some of these numbers. Our revenue growth of 6% was the fastest we saw all year. Deferred revenue increased 11% year-on-year, but we also built $60 million in unbilled subscription revenue throughout 2017.","The quarterly adjusted op margin of 40% was higher than any time over the last 15 years while at the same time, free cash flow was up 24%. Really good results. Looking specifically at the business transition, I want to highlight the metrics that we'll use each quarter to measure and communicate our progress. These include subscription revenue ARR, subscription bookings as a percent of total product bookings; the growth rate of subscription bookings as well as the change in deferred and unbilled revenue.","In Q4, as Mark said, subscription revenue ARR, which accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, grew 36% to over $350 million. We expect this growth rate to continue to accelerate during 2018. The mix of product bookings coming from subscriptions in total was 30% versus 17% a year ago, leading to three to four points of revenue headwind for the year. For this current fiscal year, we're targeting a 40% subscription bookings mix, which will generate a similar headwind. In Q4, the growth rate of subscription bookings was just under 100%. And lastly, the balance of unbilled revenue from subscriptions increased over $20 million sequentially, while the year-over-year change plus deferred and unbilled revenue was a healthy 15%.","To understand the true performance of our transition in any given quarter, you really need to look at the combination of unbilled revenue, deferred revenue and recognized revenue. As certain customers choose to sign multiyear contracts with annual billings, this amount of unbilled is going to increase. While we expect the sequential change is going to be volatile quarter-to-quarter, the overall balance should increase throughout 2018.","What's happening in the business is that customers are realizing that Citrix Cloud can add a lot of value to their own initiatives in terms of simplifying the adoption of hybrid cloud, but also accelerating their own transformation through speed and flexibility. In total, there are now a dozen services live on Citrix Cloud with options for SaaS and hybrid models. We'll give you a few customer examples from Q4.","Health First, which is a U.S.-based health care system, chose Citrix Cloud to replace a competitor's VDI solution, citing our hybrid cloud approach and our strong relationship with Microsoft. They're using Citrix to establish a cloud-enabled user workspace as a single pane of glass for delivering apps and content on a customer basis. Our integrations with Azure and Intune on the platform level and Office 365 at an app level were key decision points as well as our smart services that will help them reduce cloud consumption storage costs.","An example of an existing Workspace customer adopting cloud was, one of the largest and most respected engineering firms in the world operating in 160 countries. A longtime customer, [indiscernible] is now starting to migrate to Citrix Cloud for the ability to locate both workloads and infrastructure closest to their users as part of a hybrid cloud strategy.","Lastly, we saw a global investment management company purchase our mobile service on Citrix Cloud for 10,000 new users to replace their current MDM solution with Microsoft, Intune and Citrix. Our integration here provides the best user experience and enhance Office 365 with MicroVPN secure access to internal resources and really the overall solution for unified endpoint management.","Here's a few examples of why Citrix Cloud services are proving to be so valuable for both our new as well as our existing customers. Let's talk about networking for a minute as this business was very strong in Q4, particularly in the enterprise accounts. All in, the license was up 7%, as Mark said, despite the SSPs, the hyperscale cloud segment of the business contributing only 25% of the bookings mix. mix.","What's really driving this right here is three factors. For Workspace accounts, the integration we built across the portfolio create demonstrable value-add versus the competition, driving a healthy attach rate. For ADC accounts, our industry-leading software-first approach gives them unique flexibility to embrace hybrid cloud. And for all customers, Citrix Analytics is proving to be a big differentiator for visibility into the network, the workspace, the user and other important areas.","In addition to these specific points, customers are responding to our road map for the secure digital perimeter, which is going to be increasingly important as more and more workloads move to the cloud and as businesses continue to adopt Native Web and SaaS apps. SAP market is also noticing, in fact, NetScaler was just highlighted by a leading industry analyst in their market update as the only product that can be recommended for all ADC use cases: on-prem, in the cloud, DevOps, et cetera. This is again a reflection of our software-based approach, enabling customers to more effectively manage hybrid cloud environments.","Other vendors push you towards expensive hardware refresh cycles, we give customers flexibility. A couple of networking wins out of Q4 include one of the largest financial services companies, purchasing NetScaler as an extension of their Citrix Workspace environment, already serving about 40,000 users. This full end-to-end integration provides for a seamless user experience, improved web performance and much greater insights throughout the Citrix Analytics service.","Another example is a major U.S. Federal Government agency and a new networking customer for Citrix. They are trying to support multiple as-a-service offerings as well as DR capabilities across multiple data centers. They replaced a competitor's solution because the NetScaler multi-tenant architecture allowed them to consolidate into a much smaller footprint, driving cost savings on hardware as well as ongoing support.","And finally, while it's still an emerging solution, NetScaler SD-WAN continued to scale and we're starting to see larger deployments. In Q4, for example, a home goods retailer bought SD-WAN and began rolling out to over 1,000 individual locations. Lastly, in content collaboration or the data space, business remains strong, up 20% year-on-year.","As we shared on our last call, we've been pivoting this business to focus more directly on the enterprise and on leveraging the overall Citrix Workspace. Since we can deploy content solutions seamlessly across the Citrix Cloud, a private cloud or on-premise, our hybrid strategy remains a key differentiator in the space.","So taking a step back and reflecting on the second half of the year, I think we have accomplished a huge amount and positioned the company well for 2018. We executed the restructuring to drive faster cloud transformation. We aligned R&D to deliver integrated solutions. We defined the road map that expands our addressable market by a third, and we presented a multi-year plan that drives increased customer and shareholder value.","These apps are clearly working, and they're really allowing us to drive much faster innovation. In fact in 2017, we saw more than a 100% increase in the number of patents filed year-on-year, and we delivered an 80% increase in the number of product releases without sacrificing quality. Of course, this translates into market-leading solutions where we were once again recognized as a leader in all of our major market categories. This has helped contribute to an increase in win rates against our primary competitors, up several points in the second half of the year versus the first half.","In Q4, workspace innovation was generally focused on user experience, security and choice. With Microsoft, we collaborated to launch Citrix as a native universal Windows app for the new Windows 10 app service. We began supporting Azure Government and Azure Germany for our app and desktop service. We hit 400,000 active users on our Virtualize Skype for Business, and we introduced a new Workspace Hub device.","In networking, we released new TLS security and cryptography capabilities for our ADC solutions. We introduced new licensing models to share capacity across hybrid environments, and we shipped tech previews our latest analytics platform, for behavioral security analytics and application performance analytics. It's just relentless focus on product innovations and delivering this type of value to our customers that's really driving our total product and subscription bookings. In fact, in Q4, combined, these grew more than 10% year-on-year. This is for the first time in a while.","Exiting 2017, we now have significant momentum and purpose. We're more aligned and more focused on customer success that I've seen Citrix in a long, long time, a powerful combination. Moving into 2018, we're only going to move faster as we gain further momentum in the three strategic areas we laid out last quarter.","Our first motion, accelerating to the cloud. It lets us help our customers work the way that they want to; on-premise, hybrid or in the public cloud. That translates into opportunity for Citrix. Today, cloud-delivered services represent only about 20% of our market opportunity. But by 2020, it's expected to be more than half. We're going to be well out in front of this transition.","Our second motion, unifying the portfolio, delivers simplification while improving experience for both the end user as well as IT. Our goal is simple, intuitive, elegant experience for managing and delivering apps and data from any cloud to any device. This creates competitive differentiation and defensibility, solving real business problems for customers and making us an even more strategic partner of business.","And finally, our third motion, really just expanding into new areas. It's about helping our customers meet the demands of the future while driving incremental revenue and relevance for Citrix in areas such as security, analytics and a secure digital perimeter. It's clear that our customers are looking to operate in a multi-cloud, hybrid cloud world, and Citrix is clearly positioned to provide simple, secure and unified solutions to help them address these challenges and simplify their road maps.","Before we open up for questions, let me talk just briefly about capital return. As you know, last quarter, we announced a plan to return $2 billion to shareholders by the end of 2018. We quickly entered into a $750 million ASR, which has just been completed, and we plan to initiate a new accelerated repurchase program shortly. When we look ahead, given the recent tax \u2013 changes in tax reform and ongoing access to our foreign-generated earnings, we have an even greater confidence in the strength of our future cash flows.","Therefore, once we complete the current capital return program, we plan to increase our intended use of cash to fund capital return from 50% of free cash flow up to 75%. Of course, this will be influenced on a quarter-to-quarter basis by M&A and other periodic items. So in summary, we're really happy with the Q4 results and what we accomplished throughout the second half of 2017. We're excited about future, and I'm confident that 2018 is going to be an even more successful year.","Thank you, and as always, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard [Citi]. Your line is open.","Tyler Radke","Hey, thank you. This is Tyler Radke in for Walter. David or Mark, I was hoping just as we think about the subscription transition here, specifically in the Workspace business, I think you mentioned roughly 40% of bookings came from subscription. Could you give us some insight into how much of this was Citrix Cloud versus the CSP?","David Henshall","Yes, let me give you this in a few steps. This is David. In the overall business, it was 30% of the mix when you combine product and subscription together. So the bulk of that is coming right now from \u2013 in Q4, it was coming from Citrix Cloud, both hybrid and SaaS model. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s growing significantly faster than others.","The CSP piece right now, it\u2019s a little over $100 million business. Just to remind everybody that CSP is a subscription program. We run with our cloud service provider partners and CSP. What this does is allow us to \u2013 really provide them the infrastructure to deliver as a service offerings to their customers, monthly subscriptions, business is drawing north of 30% in the last few quarters. So terrific changes, it has been just the uptake in both hybrid and full SaaS model to Citrix Cloud.","To put it in context in just remind everybody some of the stats that came out of the prepared remarks. A year ago in Q4, it was 17% of the mix all-in. Q4 this year, it was 30% of the mix all-in, and we\u2019re forecasting that to accelerate into 2018 to about 40% of the mix. It\u2019s a little higher than our original excitations. We were thinking mid-30s, but just the uptake that we\u2019re seeing right now, we\u2019re going to bump that up and anticipate a 40% mix.","Tyler Radke","Got it. So just to be clear, within that 30% in Q4 was the \u2013 what was the bigger factor? Was it still the CSP? Or was it Citrix Cloud?","David Henshall","Citrix Cloud was more than 2 times the size of CSP.","Tyler Radke","Got it, got it. And then also, as we think about deferred revenue, obviously, the growth there has been pretty impressive and in spanning multiple quarters. How should we think about that heading into 2018? I know there are some moving parts with the subscription transition as well. It\u2019s kind of the higher maintenance programs that you\u2019re rolling through your customer base.","David Henshall","Yes. Tyler I mean, I\u2019d given out a few stats in the prepared remarks. I think are going to be just helpful for everyone to really understand what\u2019s going on in the business. And so what we\u2019ve just talked about, obviously, being mix is one of the most important ones. We\u2019ll continue to highlight subscription revenue and subscription ARR. We\u2019ll talk about the growth rate of subscription bookings each quarter, and then just this last piece. We\u2019re going to be disclosing on a quarterly basis unbilled revenue as well as deferred revenue.","So to understand the strength of the underlying business, you have to look at all of the above. In Q4, for the first time, we started disclosing this unbilled portion. So throughout the year, it\u2019s a new phenomenon for us, but throughout the year as we\u2019ve been really driving this transition. We built it up to about a little over $16 million of subscriptions that are off balance sheet, more than $20 million sequential increase from Q3 to Q4. So if you\u2019re just looking at the period, you really need to add that $20-plus million to the overall total. Just add it to deferred revenue, that gives you a better picture of underlying billings growth.","Tyler Radke","Great, thank you.","David Henshall","Thanks, Tyler.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow [Wells Fargo Securities]. Your line is open.","Phil Winslow","Hey, yes. Thanks guys for taking my question. Just actually a couple. First, David, last quarter, you said in terms of just migrating the base over to CSS, you\u2019re about halfway through in the first half of the year, you talked about 19%, 20% uplift in the pricing versus software Subscription Advantage. Wondering just what you saw Q4 kind of where are we in terms of going through the base and what sort of pricing uplift you\u2019ve been seeing sort of any impacted churn and then just one quick follow-up to that.","David Henshall","Sure, Phil. A few different questions in there, so let me just take a little step back and frame it up for everyone. So overall, CSS, moving from our product update motion to a much more holistic maintenance-type offering. As we migrate the base, its ballpark about a $200 million annualized opportunity. Remember, we\u2019re going to step people up over a multi-year period of time. So exiting Q4, we\u2019re probably 3\/4 of the way through the renewing of contracts. We started to see a lot of that starting to flow through the P&L in terms of revenue. A lot is in deferred, and then the rest is going to come in through 2018, 2019, 2020, just as we continue to step that up.","The bigger opportunity is that next step, as we move customers from CSS to full Citrix Cloud. So it's going to be an important motion more in the second half of this year. We're just doing a little bit right now is we're focused primarily on driving net new. But as we start to migrate the base, inherent in our multiyear model is about 30% uplift from that CSS. We described this publicly. That's about a $500 million incremental opportunity. What we've seen so far is north of a 40% uplift, but we just want to be conservative our longer-term outlooks. As far as the impact of CSS, no real change in renewal rates up to this point. We are seeing the similar type of an overall price uplift when we look at it on a per-seat basis. So better than we had originally anticipated.","I think we've done a good job of really articulating the value that we're delivering to customers, both those that are moving into the cloud and also those that are really just staying on-prem. Because there's a number of cloud-delivered services, for example, that they now have access to: online health checks, ways for them to just manage their infrastructure better and adds a lot of the value. So I think we're doing a good job there.","Phil Winslow","Got it, thanks. And then just one quick follow-up. In terms of unbilled, the $6 million, but how should we think about the duration of that? I mean, is it sort of typically your three-year contract that you're signing just sort of sense of duration of that backlog.","David Henshall","No exact duration of the $60-plus million. But in general, it tends to be \u2013 three-year contract tends to be our sweet spot. I'd say that at some combination of two to four years. So let's use three as a pretty good proxy at this point.","Phil Winslow","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba [Mizuho Securities]. Your line is open.","Abhey Lamba","Yes, thank you. David, can you talk a little bit about the NetScaler business \u2013 the networking business? It's been slow for some time, and you've historically talked about three major components to that business. So can you tell us how those three different buckets are doing in there?","David Henshall","Sure, Abhey. NetScaler actually did well in Q4. We talked about licenses up 7% despite the fact that SSPs were only 25% of the mix. So the real story in networking is what's going on in the enterprise, and that's the place where I think we've just \u2013 kind of looking at it into the individual segments, I'd say for a Workspace account, somebody that's a typical Citrix Cloud customer already, we're building \u2013 have built lots of deep integrations across the portfolio, and we can demonstrate the added value of leveraging Citrix and the rest of the Workspace together as really on end-to-end. And that's improving the attach rate.","The biggest part of the business is just around the overall ADC accounts. Net new where we're just leveraging our software-first approach. We create a lot of unique flexibility for customers that want to embrace hybrid cloud. Probably in addition, I'd say the Citrix Analytics is proving to be a differentiator, adding a lot of visibility into the network, into the workspace, user and other of areas. That's allowing us to continue to increase win rates and I believe take share.","So that business, just the stand-alone NetScaler business, was up double digits in new license. The SSPs, we continue to think that's going to be volatile, but it's now a little bit less than 25% of the mix.","Abhey Lamba","Got it. And can you quickly talk about churn rate of customers as they are evaluating the subscription offerings or the migration? Have you seen any difference in the churn rates versus historical? Thanks.","David Henshall","No, we haven't. Renewal rates are the same as they have been for a couple of quarters.","Abhey Lamba","Thank you. That\u2019s it from me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. This is John on for Heather. I was just hoping you could talk more broadly about the competitive environment and whether win rates have been rather consistent with historical trends. And maybe just a follow-up to the overall IT spending environment that you\u2019re seeing from this space.","David Henshall","Sure. I\u2019d say overall the IT spending environment is pretty constructive around the world. There\u2019s no spot that I would call out that is necessarily weak. In terms of overall competition, we operate in highly competitive markets, and no real change from a competitive point of view. I will say our win rates have been continuing to increase. If I look at the second half versus the first half of the year, we\u2019re up about 400 basis points as we measure it internally across both of our major product areas.","And I think the reason behind that is just that we\u2019re executing really well right now. We have been evolving our go-to-market engine pretty aggressively over the last six months. We\u2019ve got great leaders there that are just really, really doing a good job. Second part of that is all the innovation that I\u2019ve talked about. We\u2019re able to tell a very compelling story to customers, both across the workspace, networking \u2013 networking evolves into the secure perimeter. And both of those together just helping us continue to win more.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow. Your line is open.","Mohit Gogia","Thanks it\u2019s Mohit Gogia on for Raimo. I was just wondering if you can provide an update on 606 so your expectations going into fiscal 2018, how do you see those expectations \u2013 the impact on that on top line and on margin from 606 and I have a follow-up question.","Mark Coyle","Mohit, it\u2019s Mark. We largely see the impact of 606 as immaterial on the income statement. There\u2019s more impact on the balance sheet. But in terms of top line and bottom line, we see it as really immaterial, right? And we\u2019ll put some updates out on the Investor Relations site in terms of the work we\u2019ve done around 606 that you can look at.","Mohit Gogia","Okay. And a follow-up question. So can you just give some high-level points on the cash flow performance this quarter, some of the puts and takes there? And I realized that you guys don\u2019t guide to that, but if you look into fiscal year 2018, how do you see the impact of cloud transition on the cash flows, realize like we have to factor in the un-billed backlog when we sort of look on apples-to-apples basis, but just any further color on that would be helpful. Thank you.","David Henshall","Yes, Mohit this is David. I mean, cash flow has been strong in the second half of the year. I mean, on \u2013 I called about 24% growth in free cash flow in Q4 over Q4, and that\u2019s despite the fact that we\u2019ve added about $60 million in un-billed backlog across subscriptions during that period of time. So you\u2019re going to see those two things continue to grow, and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to provide this level of granularity so that everybody can understand how the business is building out. Because it\u2019s not really transitioning into the balance sheet, it\u2019s just deferring and transitioning the time when it starts to become recognized back in the P&L. So we\u2019ll provide that level of granularity, but we feel good about cash flow as well as the growth in both deferred and un-billed into 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver [Robert W. Baird]. Your line is open.","Rob Oliver","Hey, guys thank you for taking my question. David a question for you, I know the answer here might be you did raise your free cash flow \u2013 your cash flow return target on the call. So to dive in a little bit on that, on the innovation side, can you talk a little bit about how some of the acceleration here and the stability at the company is helping you potentially attract talent to go after some of these new areas?","And then having had a full quarter after those long-term targets maybe talk a little bit how you're feeling about those targets and the spending \u2013 the internal spending necessary to get there. Thanks.","David Henshall","Sure. Let me start with the last part of the question. The internal targets, we feel very good about it. I mean, obviously, our guidance we just rolled forward what he had given out last quarter. So no real change there. 1% to 2% on the top line and 29%, 30% on the op margin line. And from my point of view, it just gives us a level of conservatism to continue to execute within. When we put those numbers out originally, we were thinking probably a little bit slower migration to subscription, but even though we're seeing a faster pace, I feel comfortable maintaining in that guidance.","And so it's just \u2013 it's a statement of the overall improved execution. In terms of investments and whatnot, it's all baked in there from my mind. I mean, we're seeing really good integration across our products, which I've referred to a few times. And the work that we've done to align the company model, the organizational model, the integration of the individual solutions backed up by simplified messaging and many other things, it's all just driving the same end-to-end strategic focus on what we're trying to achieve over the next couple of years around this transition.","As we roll into mid-year and our customer conference Synergy, we're going to be putting out more and more innovation focused on really three big areas: experience, security and choice. And those are the thematic things that are really important to our customers and we're going to be driving across the portfolio. So stay tuned on that front. As far as being able to attract talent, I'd say that right now, we're more aligned as an organization that we have been a long time, and there's more of a purpose and a focus because of all those things that we're driving. Everybody understands where we're going and how we're going to get there.","We did go through a fair bit of restructuring over the second half of last year. We're doing that so that we could effectively rebalance talent and skill sets and other things. And so we're in the middle of that process, and we'll continue to execute that over the next couple of quarters. But I'm quite happy with where we are right now. I think the teams are doing an awesome job.","Rob Oliver","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov [Bank of America]. Your line is open.","Nikolay Beliov","Hi, this is Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America. Thanks for taking the questions. David, can you please talk a little bit more about the NetScaler transition to cloud? How much of the business is right now subscription-based NetScaler? What type of cloud services you can provide going forward? And lastly, in your prepared remarks, you talked about share licensing. If you can just give us more detail on that, how the revenue recognition is going to work on that new pricing model.","David Henshall","Yes. We haven't broken a lot of detail, but I'll tell you, for Q4, in the NetScaler business, about 10% of it was coming from various subscriptions. And what we've done there is we've created a couple of interesting things. Not only are there networking services available now as part of Citrix Cloud, whether those are access services and WAF services and many others, but we've also created licensing models that allow our customers to share capacity across a different set of assets.","And you think about where computing is going as more and more workloads are moving to the cloud, as compute is moving towards the edge. It just gives that hybrid environment that all of our customers are dealing with a lot more flexibility. So they can now share capacity across an on-prem device, a cloud-delivered instance and all of the other things that Citrix enables. Those basically get recognized as ratably over a term of an agreement.","So think of it as more of a subscription. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll do a number of those. And it\u2019s proving to be pretty interesting from a customer point of view. They\u2019re really embracing that because of that flexibility that I talked about.","Nikolay Beliov","And broadly speaking, in terms of go-to-market organization going into 2018, both on the direct sales side and the channel side, what did you guys make? And how incentivizing the Citrix Systems to push forward the cloud?","David Henshall","Well, two things. So Mark Ferrer who\u2019s our new Chief Revenue Officer. He\u2019s been on board now for just over a quarter. He has been making some pretty aggressive moves across this organization. I think we\u2019re set up well for 2018 to really drive a lot of worldwide centralization, worldwide execution, focus on customers and a lot of other things that we\u2019re doing, a little bit less regionally than we had been and much more on a global scale. So consistency, scalability, et cetera, thematically. In terms of the overall focus, one of the things that we\u2019ve also worked with partners on is really rebuilding the partner programs.","And so we\u2019ve taken what had been probably too complex in a number of different iterations and really simplified that. We rolled it out to partners in January at our sales kickoff. And really what that does is it strips away the complexity, get them focused on cloud and gives them incremental incentive not just to sell, but to drive enablement and onboarding over a period of time. So think of it as simplification, incentives towards where we\u2019re going. And it receives rave reviews. So I mean, what we heard back from partners was very, very positive. In terms of our own teams, it\u2019s just a matter of tweaking our compensation models such that it\u2019s at, in some cases, in neutral between an on-premise and a cloud solution. In other cases, we can just use incentives to turn that dial up and down.","Nikolay Beliov","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz [Cowen and Company]. Your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon guys. Most of my questions have been asked, but David, just getting back to the SSP business, you mentioned it was about 1\/4 of NetScaler this quarter. Can you say about how much SSP-related spend declined this quarter on a year-over-year basis, if it did? And also, how do you characterize your visibility with the SSPs for2018?","David Henshall","Yes. It was up a little bit year-on-year, just not that much. It was about 25% of the mix, roughly a year ago as well. I\u2019d say overall visibility is okay from a yearly standpoint. It continues to be a little volatile quarter-to-quarter. Good news for us is that we had such a focus on the other 75% that\u2019s what really building and growing. So the quarter-to-quarter volatility is going to be more muted going forward. In terms of overall, I think we\u2019re still maintaining the same level of market share across the major cloud properties. We\u2019re still focused on what I would call second-tier clouds and others from an expansion point of view. But in general, our forecast, as we\u2019ve described before, is to that segment of the business, that 25% is probably trending down slowly over time just as much about unit compression and things like that. So no big change from our point of view, and the real story is about all the success and enterprise.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. Perfect. And then just in light of tax reform and then also your second round of ASR plus additional buybacks throughout the year, what tax rate and share count are you guys assuming for 2018?","Mark Coyle","The tax rate\u2019s going to be about 20% \u2013 or pardon me, yes, 20% now. We\u2019re going to be at about 16% to 17% for next year.","Gregg Moskowitz","Sorry, Mark, 20% for 2018 and 16% to 17% for 2019? Is that right?","Mark Coyle","No, 20% was for 2017. It\u2019s going to be 16% to 17%","Gregg Moskowitz","Perfect. And then do you have\u2026","Mark Coyle","We haven't really guided for share count, but I mean, we're \u2013 as I've said on the ASR, we completed $750 million just recently. We're going to launch another program here shortly, and then we're going to power through the balance of the $2 billion in \u2013 over the course of this year.","Gregg Moskowitz","Great. Thanks guys.","Mark Coyle","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler [Bernstein]. Your line is open.","Tim Thornton","Hi guys, it\u2019s Tim Thornton on for Mark Moerdler. I just had a quick question about operating margin. Could you dig into what drove the benefit there and then any outlook that you guys have for 2018?","David Henshall","Yes. What drove the outlook was just the operating performance. It's \u2013 we're disciplined. We're investing, and we're focused on things that are going to drive future growth. In terms of next year, it's just a function of our guidance. We talked a lot about this on the last call and the context of a multiyear model where next year, we wanted to really hit the gas on \u2013 excuse me, this year now, for 2018 really hit the gas on for moving to subscription mix. And as that impacts more revenue on the balance sheet, it probably takes down margins in the short term. So that's all that's built into our guidance, and we'll continue to work through this year.","Tim Thornton","Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne [Evercore Partners]. Your line is open.","Tom Allen","This is actually Tom Allen for Kirk. David, can you discuss what you're doing to incentivize the channels to move customers over to your cloud offerings? And just how you're thinking about the pace of that relative to your guidance.","David Henshall","Okay. Sure, Tom. I mean, I talked about some of these a couple of times in the prepared remarks, but just in terms of the big metrics to highlight. So mix is probably the best way to look at it. So of our total product mix in 2017, about 26% came from subscription. And 2018, we are looking at that to be upwards of 40%. So 40% up from 27%, 26% last year. So that's what we're doing right there. In terms of incentives, as I mentioned a few questions ago, we put up new program in place that is making it much more simplified for our partners to onboard customers onto the cloud, gives them incentives to do that, gives them some bonuses to make sure that we're driving cloud and net new. And then when it's appropriate, later in the year, we'll focus on migrations as well.","Tom Allen","Got it. And then I guess do you have any broader thoughts on you talked about some of the but just on NetScaler is kind of growth opportunity into 2018 and also just relative to kind of the cloud provider enterprise side of the business for NetScaler?","David Henshall","Yes. Tom, I actually just went through that business a little bit. But overall, I'd say the 75% is the enterprise. We are focused on driving that business. We think we've got a lot of opportunity to grow that and to take share in that overall market. We have a really comprehensive set of solutions across different architectures that really embrace where our customers are going in terms of hybrid cloud. As far as to be SSPs, maintain a lot of market share there. That is the remaining 25% of our business. We have stated publicly that we expect over time that business will trend lower just as ASPs are compressed. That's really the main driver there.","Tom Allen","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our allotted time for question and answers. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","David Henshall","I want to say thank you for everyone for joining us today. We're really happy with the progress we're making right now. I think our transition is happening faster than we had originally anticipated, and we're going to continue to drive that through 2018. Look forward to providing the next update in three months. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's Citrix conference call.

Drew?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We experienced excellent results across Citrix in Q2. Our transition to the cloud continues to gain momentum with our Synergy announcements resonating in our markets.","In summary, total revenue grew 7% year-on-year; subscription revenue grew 49% year-on-year; subscription bookings grew to 42% of total product bookings; adjusted operating margin was 30%, up more than 400 basis points versus last year; adjusted EPS was $1.28 per share, up 24% versus last year; and combined deferred and unbilled revenue grew to $1.94 billion, up 10% over Q1 of FY 2018.","Our subscription metrics, along with our deferred revenue and unbilled metrics, highlight our success in our cloud transition. We're well on our way to achieving the 2022 metrics we communicated at Synergy in May. As stated last quarter, we adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606, using the modified retrospective method beginning in January of 2018, the effects of which were immaterial to revenue in Q2. You can find more details posted to our Investor Relations website.","Now, looking back at Q2, our Enterprise business continues to be strong. We closed 83, $1 million plus transactions compared to 79 in the prior year, with strength in healthcare, technology, financial services and government. There was a good balance across the portfolio, with strength in both cloud and on-premise Workspace Services and Networking.","Our focus on cloud and hybrid cloud, along with our Synergy messaging, provided the tailwind to our Enterprise business. We saw a consistent 7% to 8% growth in each of the geographies. Customers are realizing the value of reduced infrastructure complexity, strengthened security and flexibility to align with their business initiatives. Citrix Cloud simplifies hybrid cloud adoption, providing the same infrastructure on-premise or in the cloud.","Next, let's take a closer look at Q2 results within our primary businesses. Workspace Services had a great quarter, with revenue up 7% year-on-year to $455 million. This is the fastest growth in this business in several years. More importantly, Workspace Services product and subscription revenue grew by over 20% year-over-year. This was driven by a continuation of recent trends toward hybrid cloud subscriptions for our unified Workspace and CSP offerings. Within Workspace Services, Q2 subscriptions reached 50% of the product bookings mix for the first time.","Results were steady within the Networking business. Q2 2018 Networking revenue increased 5% year-on-year to $207 million, with subscription revenue more than doubling over last year. Finally, our Content Collaboration revenue grew about 13% year-on-year to $46 million in the quarter.","Our investments in our go-to-market initiatives this year, such as increasing our sales capacity and focused demand generation activities, are paying off in both higher growth and more strategic alignment with our customers. Given our success, this will continue to be an area of focus as we move forward.","Let's now turn to operations. In Q2, our adjusted operating margin was 30%, up more than 400 basis points from last year. While we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to spending, we've also been increasing investments in demand generation and awareness of the integrated Workspace and Networking strategy. We'll continue to balance margin expansion with the investments needed to keep growing pipeline and sales capacity as we transition the business model.","As mentioned, cash flow from operations was $170 million for the trailing 12 months. For the trailing 12 months, cash flow from operations was over $1 billion. Deferred revenue was $1.72 billion, up nearly $40 million sequentially. Unbilled subscription revenue increased sequentially by over $70 million. Combined, deferred and unbilled revenue grew 10% over Q1 of FY 2018, reflecting our strength in the quarter.","Please note that the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606, creates about a 500 basis point headwind that you would need to adjust out when comparing deferred and unbilled revenue for Q2 2018 to Q2 2017. We also closed Q2 with approximately $38 million of product backlog.","At the end of Q2, we had over $2.3 billion in cash and investments. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares in the period and still have approximately $500 million under our remaining share repurchase authorization.","Since we announced our $2 billion capital return program in November of 2017, we've repurchased almost 17 million shares for approximately $1.5 billion at an average share price of approximately $90. As we announced at our Investor Day in May, we intend to declare a dividend of $0.35 per share starting in fourth quarter of this year.","Now, turning to Q3 2018 and full-year 2018 guidance. In line with our multi-year strategy, we expect to see the continued acceleration in the adoption of our Cloud Services and subscription-based offerings which creates some headwinds to reported results. However, given our recent results and momentum, we are raising our expectations for Q3 and for 2018.","We now expect for the full-year 2018, revenue between $2.92 billion to $2.95 billion, improving our growth rate for the year by more than 100 basis points at the midpoint from prior guidance; adjusted operating margin of 30% to 31%; and adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 per share. For Q3 of 2018, we expect revenue between $715 million to $725 million, and adjusted EPS of $1.23 to $1.26 per share.","I'd now like to turn it over to David to give further color on the quarter and more color on Q2, our vision, strategy and areas of focus.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As Drew noted, Q2 was yet another strong quarter, posting upside to financial expectations while continuing to execute on the strategy transformation across the company. I'm really proud of how this team has performed over the last year.","More importantly though, customers and partners are embracing our strategy, driving the multi-year plan. Despite the headwinds from the continued mix shift, the reported numbers are clearly stronger than most anticipated in Q2, largely due to the strength of new product bookings for the Citrix Workspace.","In fact, our reported revenue growth rate more than doubled from last year, while at the same time the contribution from subscription license increased from 11% to 15% of total revenue. Couple this with cost discipline, and we continue to demonstrate a lot of upside against margin and EPS goals.","Looking specifically at the business transition, I want to reiterate the important metrics that we use each quarter to measure and communicate progress. In Q2, subscription revenue, which has been accelerating over the last year, grew 49% to over $110 million, as Drew mentioned.","On a TCV basis, the mix of product bookings coming from subscriptions was 42% versus 32% a year ago, driving greater forward visibility. For the current fiscal year, we're still targeting up to 40% subscription bookings mix for the full year. And this has led to the balance of unbilled revenue from subscriptions increasing over $70 million sequentially, further demonstrating just how strong bookings were in Q2.","This is most evident in the Workspace business which, as Drew mentioned, has now seen its strongest growth rate in many years. What's happening here is that the strategy and vision that we laid out over the last year is really resonating. Customers are seeing that Citrix adds a lot of value to their long-term initiatives in terms of simplifying hybrid cloud environments, reducing the burden of IT and accelerating the adoption of Citrix innovations. Additionally, due to our support for all major infrastructure providers, we give customers the flexibility to migrate workloads to and amongst the different clouds of their choice.","In total, Citrix Cloud now includes more than a dozen services with options for SaaS and hybrid models, as well as services for those customers with only on-prem implementations to help them manage and monitor their infrastructure more effectively.","I'd say customer momentum really stepped up after our Synergy event in May. We've had great feedback regarding alignment and clarity of our strategy, as well as the record volume of new innovations and announcements we made with partners like Microsoft, Google and others.","Our message there focused on the future of work and how we can help IT lower infrastructure costs while driving higher employee productivity. The current cloud mobile era of technology has really created unprecedented flexibility in compute and work styles. However, what we're seeing is that most customers are deploying a growing number of discrete point product solutions in order to manage this; an approach that is really both complex and expensive. Our focus has been to abstract away much of the complexity associated with these niche products and highlight the benefits of our complete integrated Citrix solutions.","I'd say, of all the innovations at Synergy, of particular interest to customers was the Citrix Workspace app, the Analytics platform and our next-generation unified, networking and security vision that we call the Secure Digital Perimeter.","So the Workspace app provides access to all application and content needed to be productive. This includes differentiated capabilities such as federated identity, unified experience, out-of-the-box integration to leading SaaS apps and a broad approach to universal endpoint management.","Most importantly, we've built a general-purpose solution to provide security management for all application types, including value for those customers that chose not to deploy or use app virtualization or DDI. And this opens up a much broader commercial opportunity for us.","Attendees were also positive about the launch of Citrix Analytics platform for real-time detection and automated resolution of potential security threats across user, device, network and file elements. This leverages the instrumentation that we built across the portfolio to provide very unique capabilities and a generation of actionable insights.","And finally, as I said, we received good feedback on our unique security approach that supports trusted computing outside the corporate data center, as our Networking products have been extended into the cloud more than ever before. This included announcements such as Citrix Cloud app control, SD-WAN service for MSBs and SD-WAN on Azure, which leverages Azure's Virtual WAN service to enhance overall app performance and user experiences at branch operations and at the edge.","Basically, our transformation isn't about just porting our existing discrete products to cloud service, but unifying our products into complete solutions that more holistically address the needs of the market. And, in the process, giving us an increasing advantage over traditional and upstart competitors who continue to deliver just point products. So lots of great stuff.","Turning back to Q2, let me give you some large customer examples to highlight the diversity of use cases, the accelerating adoption of our services and our continued competitive advantage in the market. All in, we had a really big quarter for large deals which you can see in the results and in the growth in unbilled revenue.","This is a reflection of our increased focus on C-level conversations and the confidence that our customers are seeing in our ability to partner with them well into the future. For the first time, we closed 4 transactions greater than $10 million each in a quarter; and all the top 10 largest Citrix Cloud deals this quarter exceeded $1 million.","In one such transaction, seeking cost savings, flexibility, increased security and improved end-user experience, Willis Towers Watson, a leading global advisory, brokering and solutions company with more than 40,000 employees worldwide, selected Citrix Cloud for its workspace delivery needs as they execute on a cloud-first vision. It was our close partnership with Microsoft that created the alignment needed to deliver a seamless solution to help this company shift easily from an on-premise delivery model to an Azure-focused model powered by Citrix Cloud.","In another transaction, which is a major win against two primary competitors, Braskem, the largest petrochemical company in Latin America, chose Citrix Workspace, delivered as a service, to fulfill their vision of moving to the cloud with a truly integrated workspace experience. Compliance and security were the top concerns for Braskem, and the Citrix Workspace was the only solution that allowed them to control all of their apps, desktops and, most importantly, their content, while also delivering a unified, consumer-grade experience for their employees and their customers.","Here are just a couple examples why our Cloud Services are proving to be so valuable to both new and existing customers and why we're winning these types of opportunities. These examples also demonstrate how our customers are committing to us for multiple years, validating our direction as part of their current and future road maps.","So let's talk about Networking for a minute, as this business was stable in Q2 across both the hyperscale SSP segment and the Enterprise accounts, as Drew mentioned. In fact, the mix was 41% SSP, same as last year.","What's driving this is really three factors. For customers focused on a digital workspace, the integrations we built across the portfolio create demonstrable added value for security, identity and performance. For ADC accounts, our industry-leading software-first approach gives them the unique flexibility to embrace the hybrid cloud. And really for all customers, Citrix Analytics is a differentiator for visibility into the network, the workspace, the user and other important areas.","Networking wins in Q2 included a large Internet-based publishing company choosing Citrix Networking to help drive their multi-cloud strategy, helping them future-proof the organization with a hybrid model which will scale easily as this company grows through acquisition.","A U.S. auto parts manufacturer replaced a competitor's ADC solution with Citrix to facilitate their secure connection to external contractors, citing our superior long-term vision for cloud and networking services.","And, finally, there was also several new SD-WAN wins in a variety of areas, including cross-sell to existing Workspace customers to provide optimization of HDX traffic and to net new customers invest in our larger strategy of integrated networking delivered via Citrix Cloud.","So entering the second half, I feel really good about our momentum and our purpose. We're more aligned and more focused on customer success than ever before. Clearly, financial results are strong, and we're proving that you can drive a cloud transition and accelerate revenues and margins together and it's a powerful combination.","Looking forward, our focus is going to remain on three strategic motions: one, accelerating to the cloud to help our customers work the way they want to: on-prem, hybrid or in the public cloud; second, unifying our portfolio to deliver a simple intuitive element workspace with a premium on experience, security and choice; and lastly, extending our solutions into new areas to help our customers meet the demands of the future while expanding our addressable margin and driving incremental revenue and relevance for Citrix in areas such as security, analytics and the Secure Digital Perimeter.","It's clear that our customers are looking to operate in a multi-cloud, hybrid cloud world and Citrix is clearly positioned to provide simple, secure and unified solutions to help them address these challenges as well as simplifying their road maps. We're excited about the future, and I'm confident in the progress that we're making so far in 2018.","Thank you. And, as always, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Philip Winslow from Wells Fargo.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. David, just wanted to focus in on Workspace Services because, as you mentioned, that's the highest growth rate we've seen in a while in that segment. And as you pointed out too, we even saw the mix toward subscription move higher quarter-to-quarter and a lot year-over-year. And it seemed like license was strong and subscription was strong. But what is the feedback that you're getting from customers that's driving essentially like both those two to move up? And how should we think about sort of the big deals impacting that dynamic? And I've just got one follow-up to that.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Phil. Thanks very much. I mean you take a step back and let me add a little context here. So, I mean, we laid out a strategy in the second half last year and we're executing against that strategy. I'm really happy with the performance of the team and the reception from customers and partners as well. And, obviously, the results in the aggregate are well ahead of the original timeline. So, as we said, we had a terrific Workspace quarter. Things came together in Q2.","I'd say, a lot of it was good momentum coming out of Synergy and the customer feedback that we got on the vision and the strategy was really positive. And I think that provides more confidence when it comes to signing up for larger and even longer term transactions. So the confidence that we can deliver solutions they need for today's initiatives, but more importantly partner them over a protracted period of time. Our sales teams around the world are executing extremely well, and they've been focused on building more direct strategic relationships at the C-level, as well as investments and capacity. Those are really helping.","So when you look specifically to Workspace business, we did have a record number of million-dollar-plus transactions. We had multiple eight-figure transaction, good balance across the geos. Both the EMEA area and North America, we're well into the double digits from a demand point of view on that side.","I'd say that we had a quarter where you also saw perpetual license very strong as well. So while subscription was huge, and that drove a lot of the unbilled, come back to in a minute, we also had a good perpetual license quarter. So the rising tide really lifted both.","Citrix Cloud is the big driver. All 10 of the largest deals there were all over $1 million each. The subscription mix within the Workspace crossed 50% for the first time. Much higher if you include installed base trade-up as well. That's an early program, the one that's starting to get some good transaction. And CSP, which we haven't talked too much about. But just as a reminder, that's for our partners that are looking to build the infrastructure to deliver some sort of vertical services for their end customers. I mean that business is still growing in the 30% to 40% range. So really across the board, very happy with that.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up on cash flow. I mean, obviously, we've seeing a big increase year-over-year in the first half. I know the second half of last year was particularly strong too. But if I just say, hey, the second half of this year is flat with the second half of 2017, I mean that puts you almost on path for a $7-plus of free cash flow per share this year. And I know your guidance for 2020 is $7-plus and at Analyst Day you said, okay, that might shift into 2019. But maybe kind of help us think through kind of second half free cash flow, but also sort of the progression to those 2022 numbers? Thanks.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Good question. I mean, it's clear that we're, from a booking standpoint, running well ahead of our original expectations. So on a trailing 12-month basis, we're well over $1 billion of cash flow from ops, and that translates into the low $7 free cash flow a little bit behind that. So the way to think about cash flow, just as a reminder to everybody, that as we go through this transition, one of the things that we are doing is reducing the frequency of billing cycles.","So we're putting more and more revenue off the books. That was that big step-up in unbilled revenue that you saw. And so, that really needs to be looked at in concert with actual reported cash flow. And when you're trying to calculate bookings, look at the change in deferred, the change in unbilled and then recognized revenue. Those are really the three pieces to really triangulate what future cash flows are going to look like for us.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","You bet. Thanks, Phil.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Rob Owens from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys, and thanks for taking my question as well. If you look at the strength that you saw in new product bookings from Citrix Workspace, how much of that's coming from new customers and customer acquisition versus kind of selling into the legacy base, the new capability. Can you provide any color there?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Rob. It's both, of course. So you need to look at it probably in three ways. One is when we talk about Trade-up and Transition or TTU that we have referenced a couple of times. That is more of an installed based customer that we're migrating Citrix Cloud. That is, we kept that entirely out of the conversation so far, and I want to keep everything focused on net new. And so, TTU is a motion that's now into the eight figures, but it's still pretty early. We're going to focus more on that in the second half of the year.","So net new is where the bulk of all the demand is coming from. That is, in some cases, because we're so broadly distributed, we're already touching almost all of the global 5,000. But these are net new opportunities within those accounts, to a large degree. And then truly net new, companies that we have never done business with in any product in our history, we add several hundred per quarter.","Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And usually when companies are going through a product transition especially within your largest category to more subscription, you don't see the product and license strength that you saw this quarter. So could you provide a little more context or color around exactly what's going on there? And as you kind of evaluate the puts and takes then for Q3 and I guess some of the conservatism around growth, is it not sustainable relative to product and license? Was there something in the quarter that was an aberration or something of that nature?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Rob, no aberration I'd say. I mean, listen, we're super happy with the progress that we've made. I think this is the fourth quarter in a row that we've been able to raise our external expectations. I mean, we're taking full year guidance up by 100, 150 basis points from a growth rate point of view. And that's despite having a really large Q2. We're also raising expectations for Q3. So really positive, but I don't want to get ahead of ourselves as well.","Seeing growth in product and subscription for this business at 20% is a growth rate we haven't seen in 8 years. So it's nice to see that happening, but I want to see a few more data points before we start talking about what the real trend of the rate is. So we're going to maintain a very positive, but an appropriate point of view going into Q3. Also, Q3, as you as you know, it's a summer quarter where customers are out for large parts of it. So it tends to be back end loaded. So once we get through Q3, we'll think about where we think the new trend line is.","Rob Owens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, David.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Heather Belini from Goldman Sachs.","Ted Lin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Ted Lin on for Heather. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. A couple from me. Can you give us, I guess, some more color into the unified and integrated Workspace and Networking offerings in terms of the ability to open new conversations or drive higher level conversations?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Ted. I mean the way to think about it is when we talk about the integrated Workspace, I mean, that's a combination of three big forces that we laid out middle of last year that are really shaping the way we're driving operations in the company. The first one is by unifying the portfolio. That's simply bringing point products and their development teams together so that we can create truly integrated solutions. That's one.","Second piece was accelerating into the cloud so that we can build out a portfolio of cloud solutions to allow us to meet customers wherever they are on their journey. And, frankly, I think most are going to be on a hybrid cloud model for some \u2013 period of many years. And it's important for us to be able to help them bridge that, regardless of what they're trying to do in real-time.","And then the third area is a little bit more about vision, and that's where the secure perimeter comes in where we can talk about the evolution of networking services and how they are ultimately going to be impacted as more workloads move to the cloud and as compute moves out to the edge, it becomes more of a measure of services over time.","A lot of companies aren't deploying that way yet. But when they look at engaging with a partner like Citrix for a current project, being able to communicate the vision and where we're going to give them confidence that we're going to be there as their projects catch up to that is really important. And that's one of the reasons why we've been focused so much on enabling our teams to sell at a more strategic level to be able to talk about the business from a top-down point of view, and give this broader perspective of infrastructure versus point projects along the way.","And I think that's one of the things that has really led to the uptick in large transactions. And, again, like I said, it's very early coming out of Synergy, but the feedback that we received from that on some of the newer initiatives that are, frankly, all hitting the market either in the last couple of weeks or in the next couple of weeks, great feedback. And we'll just work with customers to get those started in their infrastructure and see where we go from there.","Ted Lin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. That's very helpful. And then on maintenance, I think you're now on year two of the mandatory migrations to CSS maintenance. What are the types of uplifts that you're seeing? And what were your expectations going in?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Drew, why don't you take that question?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure. Great question, Ted. Yeah, we're really pretty much through the CSS uplift. That really started over a year ago. And so, most of that's rolling into revenue now. But in terms of the new business, the uplift that we're really seeing as we build deferred \u2013 as David pointed out or as we pointed out earlier, deferred and unbilled were up $170 million sequentially. And the bulk of that's really coming out of new business, primarily the subscription business. And, again, 42% of the product bookings this quarter were subscriptions. So you could see the growth there. It's really driven off the new business on the subscription side.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","One interesting thing to add to that is that when we adopted ASC 606 last quarter, we had to take a haircut of a better part of $100 million on deferred revenue as well. So some of that price uplift that we're able to achieve over the second half of last year kind of got washed away from an accounting change. But that said, it's definitely one of the things that's helping drive the overall acceleration of revenue growth over the last five quarters.","Ted Lin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.","David Rainville - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. This is David Rainville actually on for Raimo. Thanks for taking our question, and congrats on a nice quarter once again. Maybe another question around \u2013 more high-level question around Workspace, if that's okay. It seems that both subscription and perpetual did well this quarter, highlighting a strong percentage in subscription bookings in the segment too. I'm just wondering can you give us a little bit more color about what's driving customers to go for one or the other and what you're seeing in the Workspace, like, competitive landscape at the moment.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, let me take the last part of that question first. The landscape continues to be very, very competitive as you'd imagine. So no change on that front. But if you step back for a minute, it's the broader forces that we've talked about for a long time and were a key element of our overall Synergy conference. I mean the fact is, people are concerned \u2013 CIOs, CEOs \u2013 about getting more productivity and engagement out of their workforce.","And while this current era of computing \u2013 and we call it the mobile cloud era \u2013 has created unprecedented flexibility from a compute standpoint and from a device standpoint, in most customers, their environment, all that does is add complexity. And so, what they're doing is they're employing a number of little point product solutions to help address everything from app delivery, to identity, to managing SaaS and connectivity. And that's expensive and it's complex.","And so, our approach has been to abstract away as much of that complexity as we can and provide this vision for a unified workspace, and one that helps them cut costs, helps them simplify, but more importantly kind of drive that enablement around productivity of the workforce, but do it in a secure manner, do it in a way that embraces the way that people are working today. So that's kind of the uber backdrop and the message.","And when it comes to individual customers, it depends on really what they're driving immediately from their own initiatives. I mean, the two that we referenced by name in the script, like Willis Towers Watson, everybody knows they're a leading advisory and brokerage firm with tens of thousands of employees. I mean they're adopting a cloud-first approach. And so, they're very much focused on Azure. And because of the partnership with Microsoft, being able to help manage their entire workspace as a cloud-delivered service from Azure was really the critical part of the conversation there. So that's one good example.","Customers that also have large on-premise deployments, sometimes in very highly-regulated industries or maybe outside the U.S., they're just going to continue to expand that. And that's what we saw at the same time. So it just depends on where they are. I'd say, longer term, most will migrate towards some form of hybrid cloud. That's certainly a core part of our strategy. But we want to make sure that we're not pushing customers to adopt faster than they're ready. And it's important for us to have this support for both architectures.","David Rainville - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes sense. And maybe just a quick follow-up. At the Analyst Day, you mentioned roughly 400,000 enterprises as a Citrix customer. What is the wider long-term opportunity for Workspace-as-a-service as a subscription when you think in the long-term? And, of course, not looking for an exact number, but just more of a framework on how you think about this?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I'll tell you, Mike, the high-level framework. This is an important way that we talk about it internally, is that the Citrix Workspace app was designed as a general-purpose solution. What I mean by that is it adds value to applications of all types, SaaS, mobile, virtualized, et cetera, and as well as content and doing that in a way that doesn't rely on virtualization. And so, that's an internally important way for people to think about it.","It's not just a renaming or a reimplementation of a virtualization solution, but it's truly general-purpose infrastructure and it allows you to address those use cases very individually and tailor those for every user inside of every enterprise. So when we think about it, that's strategically where we're going and why we announced some of these new capabilities like cloud app control service and others that are a critical part of that Workspace vision. We're just bringing those to market now. There's obviously a long ways to go from an execution standpoint, but general purpose is clearly the way that we unlock a much broader opportunity than we might have been looking at in the past.","David Rainville - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes sense. Thank you so much.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. David, the first question is for you. With the new product you introduced at Synergy, how do you create a bridge between the endpoint buyer, security buyer, and I think buyer \u2013 and networking buyer within the organization? How is the selling motion changing in light of the diversified portfolio?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","It's interesting, the portfolio has gotten a lot simpler over the last two or three years. I mean, that was a critical element. Part of our strategy was about focusing on the things that are truly important to the customer, and then stripping away everything else. And that's, frankly, allowed us to go much faster from an execution point of view.","When we think about the Workspace and some of the new elements today, the core strategy, if you want to talk at a high-level, it's a C-level conversation, it's an infrastructure conversation; it's not for the project buyer. That said, all of these advancements that we're making and the individual capabilities, be it in ADC or be it in a file sync and share, or virtualization, all of those are designed to enhance their category competitiveness, as well as differentiation for those customers that are still looking at it purely from a project basis.","But by the time you start talking about a large transaction, you're generally dealing with a CIO, VP of IT or somebody at a very senior level that can help coordinate what might have historically been a point product buyer. And, again, that's part of the enablement that we're working through right now. It's one of these things that when we bring customers into the briefing center, you'll see a mix nowadays of executive leadership, security, networking and others. Just depends on where the customer is. And, frankly, it depends a little bit on the customer size.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And my second question is on share file, the growth rate has accelerated here to the low-teens versus 20%, 30% in the past. Is the low-teens kind of like the new normal? What is the trend here? Are there plans to rejuvenate the business?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, I think, as everyone knows, we had a pretty major strategy shift in that business over the course of the last year. The thing that we articulated was we were going to emphasize the integration with the holistic Workspace and focus more on the Enterprise than it had been as a cloud storage solution with a lot of SMB type focus. And that's a core part of the strategy. And so, less of a stand-alone sale and more a sale in the context of the Workspace. I mean, that's the direction we're going.","So I think the growth rate right now is just a reflection of that. I mean, we're not allocating dollars in between the bundles, so it's going to be consumed that way more and more over time. Probably a year to two years out, we'll be talking about the Workspace as largely the one element of revenue as the one that matters most from a visibility standpoint. But, today, it's still important to look at them individually.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company","Okay, thank you very much. So, David, it's terrific to see 4 transactions over $10 million each in the quarter, especially for Q2. How would you characterize the large deal pipeline at this time? And then also, I know that you don't explicitly high to it, but what are your high-level expectations for unbilled in Q3 and Q4?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, let me take the last question. I mean unbilled \u2013 I mean as everybody has seen, unbilled had a really big spike in Q2. We had very, very strong bookings in the second quarter. We're not going to forecast that going out. It's one of those things that, as we went through this transition, we committed to reporting to because we wanted to make sure that everybody has the elements necessary to truly measure the progress against our transformation. But we're just not going to forecast that at this point.","Incredibly happy with the number in Q2. It was certainly well above over our internal expectations. As I mentioned before, the two largest geos, both showed double-digit growth, which was great. We haven't disclosed it yet, but on an ACV basis, we had similar growth rates to the TCV. And so, we're not changing duration at all. It's just a function of a really strong quarter.","In terms of looking forward, and I'll repeat what I said earlier that we're happy with where we are. We've been showing better and better progress every quarter. But I also want to just remain normally cautious like we always are in terms of forward outlook. And let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's a summer quarter. So come back in Q3 and talk about if we're on a different trajectory or not. But as of right now, we're executing against our 2022 plan that we laid out. We're ahead of the ramp rate, clearly. But that's the backdrop that we're executing on right now.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company","Okay, perfect. And then in terms of that third geo, so the APJ business did perform better this quarter at least in terms of revenue growth. Is there anything in particular that you would attribute that to?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","It's just APJ is the smallest of the three regions. It tends to be a little bit more volatile from a result standpoint. It's surprisingly consistent having all three geos at that 7%, 8% at the same time. I wouldn't expect it to be that way. And from an underlying demand and booking standpoint, as I said, the two strongest in Q2 were North America and Europe. Actually, the Americas and EMEA, let's put it that way, and APJ was trailing. That reverses itself, probably, in Q3 or Q4. But, overall, we're just happy with the progress we're seeing across the globe. I think our sales teams are continuing to execute better and better all the time.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter; really nice.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got two questions for you. First one is, as everyone has discussed, we've seen the stronger Workspace result. And even that was given the negative impact of the subscription transition. Can you give us a sense of how much that transition impacted what the reported number would be?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Mark, I'm not sure I 100% understand your question. But I will say that over 50% of the TCV bookings for Workspace were subscription leading to very little recognized. When we look at the growth in subscription from an unbilled standpoint, I mean subscriptions increased, what, a little over $70 million, Drew, sequentially?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","And the vast majority of that is just Workspace cloud \u2013 Citrix Cloud that's used for the Workspace. So that's really the driver. The underlying bookings were clearly in the double-digit range.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. But if you'd not have been moving to subscription, obviously, the growth would have been faster than what was reported.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Oh, sure.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. No sense of how much, right?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, I don't think it's important to break it out at this point. I'd rather not get into the habit of disclosing that because moving to subscriptions really is the \u2013 it is the strategy right now, and that's where we're going. And the fact that we can actually post accelerating growth while we're driving an even bigger percentage mix is pretty cool. We're very happy with that right now.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. A quick follow-up. Roughly, the discussion is about the continuing or increasing relationship at the C-level between Citrix and the larger clients. Can you give us a sense if that's part of a trend in terms of a move more to direct? Or is there any change in terms of how much of the revenue, how much of the relationship is through the channel versus direct and how you expect that to change as you continue through the subscription change?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, sure. I think that as we've been talking for the last year or so, I mean, we've been making a very direct effort to enhance our relationships at a strategic level with our customers. And we've been investing in everything from a number of global roles to do that, more quota-carrying capacity. Mark Ferrer and team have been driving just a lot of operational changes across the board.","That said, we still fulfill the vast, vast majority of our business through partners. The partner network is changing, as you would imagine, changing with the landscape of technology. So we have been recruiting new partners along the way, folks that are more comfortable with selling cloud and are participating with Microsoft network in areas like that. And we're continuing to work on enablement for our existing partners.","I think we're still pretty early in the game from an enablement standpoint. And, frankly, it's one of the reasons why the various channel check notes that I read pre-quarter, some were wildly positive and some were negative. And I think that's just a reflection of a channel in transition and it's a matter of who you talk to.","And so, we have several thousand partners that transact with us any given quarter. Some are moving much faster than others. And it's incumbent upon us to keep driving enablement, making sure we've got programs in place so that people can make a lot of money. And just from a program standpoint, we are trying to drive more aligned with the strategy and much less about trading up an installed base customer. And so, there's a strategy shift going on at the same time.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent. I really appreciate it. That was very helpful.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.","Peter Levine - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. This is actually Peter Levine in for Kirk. So just two quick questions. Can you discuss some of the competitive dynamics that you're seeing on the Network side of the business? Do you feel like it's more kind of taking share or it's just kind of an overall uptick in the Networking side?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, Networking is \u2013 no change in the competitive dynamics. I mean it's always been a highly competitive market. And I think that if you look backwards, the business in ADC, we've been taking share gradually for probably a decade now. And when we look at it, it's just a combination of SSPs continuing to be a little lumpy, but I think we're doing a better job of broadening that base to help reduce some of the volatility there. But the bulk of the business is coming from the Enterprise.","And I'd say there's really three factors. One is that the customers that are focused on the Workspace, we have built nice integrations across that. And so, you can do unique things with the combination of the solution that really differentiate, can drive value, whether it's security, identity, performance, et cetera.","In a typical competitive ADC account, we've got a really good hybrid cloud story. We've always been a software product that can be deployed across hardware appliances, virtual appliance and a container, et cetera. And that just gives us a lot of flexibility to (48:32) or whatever project that a customer has.","And I'd say the one area that's popped out as a differentiator over the last, let's call it, the last year, year-and-a-half has been around Analytics. And an Analytics approach just buys a lot more visibility into the Network or the Workspace or the user, if you're one of those customers. And that's been a nice differentiator. So we've got a good solution there, and I think we probably continue to take share. It's on a gradual basis.","Peter Levine - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. And then, can you provide us any updates on the Microsoft partnership? How much of that is influencing some of the growth in the larger deals you guys talked about in the call? Thanks.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, the partnership is great. I mean, it's been strong now for two decades. It's a really important part of what we do because Microsoft is so synonymous with applications and a critical part of our customer environment. We continue to work very closely on a lot of different initiatives, whether it's integration and extension on the mobile side, they're an important part of what we're doing to integrate with Intune and with apps.","The cloud side is obviously super important as we have leveraged Azure in not only as the foundation for our cloud, but when we go and drive joint solutions with customers. Azure is certainly getting a lot of traction when it comes to Enterprise workloads. So a lot of mindshare on that side. And when we can talk about bringing things together relatively seamlessly, that's a nice value-add.","And then just as we've leveraged the platform for resource zones, like we made an announcement at Synergy that we're going to be working with Azure Gov for those types of customers that want Citrix Cloud in a highly regulated environment. So it's pretty multi-faceted and just a great partnership for a long time now.","Peter Levine - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the commentary.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Drew Foster from Citigroup.","Drew Foster - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Wondering, given the strong results this quarter and really year-to-date at what point you might consider raising what many might consider to be conservative 2020 targets laid out at Synergy this year? And then, a quick follow-up. Thanks.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say that in terms of raising the 2020 and 2022, I mean, we're three quarters in when we laid them out the first time and it's great to be well ahead. And, yeah, we'll come back and revisit that from time to time. I mean, when we were in May, which was just a couple months ago, we added another couple of years to that which shows the further inflection and the power of the model transition. So we'll see. I don't think we're in any rush to update the longer-term targets, but we certainly will when it becomes obvious that we're just running well ahead of plan. No timeline at this point.","Drew Foster - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Okay. And then last question was you mentioned expanding to new growth areas as a \u2013 strategic growth area that you pointed out. And does that imply that we should be thinking about a step-up in M&A? And if so, what particular areas are most attractive?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. When I talk about that, you look at some of the adjacencies around the newer initiatives; newer meaning, the Analytics side of the house, the Secure Digital Perimeter. And it opens up some opportunities for us.","But in terms of M&A expectations, like everybody, we're constantly looking at opportunities. But we're going to have a good discipline. We have a good discipline for answering the question of what exactly do we get synergies from, whether it's a buyer, or out-to-market, or technology platform. And we don't have a desire to acquire for the sake of acquiring. And so, we'll continue to be active looking, and then it's just got to be the right fit for us to actually move forward.","Drew Foster - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.","Robert Majek - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. This is actually Robert Majek on for Michael today. Can you just talk about Zed Mobile and how that offering is doing? And perhaps give us an update on the competitive landscape in EMM?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Actually, we don't talk too much about stand-alone mobile that much anymore. We talk about it in the context of the Workspace. And if you roll the clock back a couple of quarters, I mean a large part of our strategy around mobile was to get out of the commodity side of mobility and MDM, MAM, it's kind of a commodity-type service, and look at it in the context of the Workspace. So what we've done is drive integrations across the Workspace and really expanded that from a universal endpoint management standpoint.","So if you look at some of the new announcements around Synergy, we really have probably the broadest approach to universal endpoint management now, including certain IoT devices and other things. And our approach is going to be less stand-alone and more integrated. That's a common theme across our portfolio right now because, like I said earlier, the challenge that all of our customers are having of managing all of these discrete point products is complex and it's hard. And the more that we can simplify, I think the more interesting that's going to be.","Now, I have a thing that I mentioned just a minute ago on an earlier question, is the work that we'll continue to do with Microsoft to embrace and extend Intune in the ways that really help those customers that have what is a great solution, but there's just more we can do on that to partner.","Robert Majek - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird.","Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One for Drew. Drew, you mentioned the increased investments in demand generation. Can you add a little bit of color there and talk about it? I know, David, you just talked a lot about some of the partnerships and adding new channel partners, particularly those focused on Azure. But, Drew, could you provide a little bit more color on kind of where you see some of those investments being most necessary? Thank you, guys, very much.","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Rob. Again, just looking forward, we do feel like we've got a bit of a tailwind off of Synergy and we wanted to make sure we're building out for the rest of the year and next year. And we've obviously been very disciplined on spending. What we wanted to do was just get really focused, laser-focused on where we saw opportunities for return.","And so, we've been investing really in two things, I think, demand generation, lead generation and then turning that back into the sales force and building capacity and quota-carrying reps and SEs. And that's been the focus of it. And, obviously, we saw a strong close for the quarter as you can see in the numbers. And really just focusing on delivering the messages from Synergy about the cloud.","And so far, everything we've seen has paid off and we're going to continue to do that into the future. But you could see we've obviously, during the year, taken up the op margin guidance that overperformed this quarter as well. So it's looking very good.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Let me just add on top of that. There's two other areas that are important. One is just the overall awareness in branding. I mean we need to be a little bit more visible. Part of this transition and transformation is it's helping reshape Citrix in terms of more general-purpose versus being focused historically on virtualization. So that's one. And on a related note is also around enablement, which I've mentioned a couple of times. And we've got a lot of work to do, as you would imagine, in terms of just continuing to drive enablement forward across both our internal teams and our partners around the world.","Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you, guys, very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. David, I'd like to go back to Rob Owen's question because I just want to make sure we understand the results here. And you gave a lot of data, but it's not quite broken out the way it used to be. And it really goes into the product and license line which grew 1% this quarter, but it was $20 million or more better than what was implied in guidance. And that line used to see a lot of volatility because of the Networking space because of large Internet providers that you sold to.","And I'm just curious, is that what \u2013 did that this quarter too? You talked a lot about the strength in Workspace Services. But the line grew 1%, which it's nice to see growth. It's decent. But it is a lot better than what was implied in guidance. So just trying to understand that line. I know there's transition going on, but it'd be helpful with a little more color here.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. John, as you know, I guess it's probably over a year ago now when we laid out a new way we wanted to report revenue, maybe six quarters ago, in anticipation of lining the strategy up so it'd be easy to really get a view of where we're going. And that's why we broke out subscription as a primary focus. When I look at the business, I tend to look at the combination of product plus subscription together as a way to measure the success of each product.","And so, if I look at Networking, for example, the product plus subscription in Networking was about 7% growth and the product plus subscription in Workspace was about 20% growth. And so, that's how we look at it internally. There was no weird anomalies in terms of SSPs on the Network side. Networking growth was 5%. And within that, the slowest element was around maintenance. Maintenance grew at like, 3%. And then the rest of it was the 7% that I mentioned. Does that help?","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, it does. So it doesn't sound like you've got any huge product sales to large Internet providers. So that is helpful. Thank you. And I think someone asked this question and Drew addressed it, but I just wanted to be sure I understood it too. Under the Workspace Services and sort of the CSS program, it sounds like you've sort of lapped that benefit. So the benefit you're seeing now, it sounds like it's more of an underlying foundational build versus sort of a pricing increase benefit, which was sort of what was going on there for a while.","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, John...","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Is that accurate?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, look, what's really happening is we're building the new business; it's the cloud and subscriptions. And you can see it in the combination of the deferred and unbilled growth. So $170 million quarter-on-quarter. That's where you're really seeing the new business build. The great thing is there, obviously, you get predictability of revenue. You're creating better economics because it's a recurring revenue stream, I think, which we all like.","And then from the CSS perspective, yeah, there's a little bit left. But I think we're really through anything material there. And there's always a little bit of a tail there, but it's very small at this point. We lapped that earlier in the year.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith and my congrats on a very nice quarter as well. David, I wanted to go back to CSS. I think at Analyst Day you mentioned, I think, that 81% of the base on CSS. Has the early conversation started to happen in terms of getting some of those CSS customers to move to Citrix Cloud? Any early indications on what percentage of those customers are beginning to convert to Citrix Cloud to maybe avoid the rest of the price increase on CSS?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, let me clarify one thing. I mean there's no way to avoid necessarily. Because when we look at the upgrade path, if you're an existing customer, there's one path that moves from a support offering; and then there's another path that moves from CSS. And the only difference is really price. I mean we're working backwards from what the cloud price is, and it's not a price increase.","I also want to be pretty careful when we talk about this because this is really about just demonstrating incremental value when we talk about cloud. This is back to the enablement point that I mentioned before. And so, when we deliver cloud, like I said, it's not just about our infrastructure, but all of the new innovations that are only available as a cloud service. Like, for example, unified experience, the analytics platform, the cloud app control service I mentioned before, federated identity, integrated content. All of these things are really the value-add that a customer gets when they consume Citrix Cloud; granted that they'll all be consuming that at a different pace. But that's really been the main driver.","When we talk about installed base, there is a program called Trade up and Transition, or TTU. That's what we've referenced for a few quarters now. And that business is starting to ramp. It's now into the eight figures from a TCV point of view, but it's really a second half focus item more than anything else.","So as we laid out on Analyst Day, the first part of this year is about just driving net new demand, net new customers and really getting that engine going, and trying to incent both our field teams, our go-to-market on those items. And so, that's where the very big bulk of compensation comes from. And then the TTU piece is a little bit downstream. So again, a critical part of our subscription transition, but one that we wanted to sequence behind the net new.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate the clarification there, David. And I guess my follow-up question is also sort of going back to Analyst Day. One of your messages there was around the corporate mid-market SMB opportunity that still seems relatively under-penetrated. This quarter seemed to be more Enterprise-heavy, and I just wanted to get a sense of how you're feeling about the traction or the programs that you have to drive growth in some of those under-penetrated markets. What's your assessment of that as we go to the second half?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, a few things. I mean, one is, when we look at the CSP, I know there's a lot of acronym, the cloud service provider part, that business is largely \u2013 well, it's all partner-driven and it's largely focused on that SMB segment. That is well into the plus $100 million run rate at this point in time and it's growing somewhere north of 30%. And so, that's probably the most direct way that we look at that.","I mean, as we go forward, some of the other initiatives that we are thinking about is continuing to simplify the approach to the cloud, make the products more applicable to a smaller, simpler use case. But just really where the infrastructure gives the most value is when you typically have a larger, more complex environment, some concern around security, governance, compliance. I mean those are the types of attributes that are driving such success in markets \u2013 or verticals like financial services and government and healthcare and others. So I wouldn't say we're more focused on the Enterprise today, it's just that the Enterprise is \u2013 it's a strong market.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate the thought. Thanks, David.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing comments.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I want to thank everybody for joining us today.

Earlier this morning, we reported our 3Q fiscal 2019 results. You can see those on our earnings number that are posted on our Investor Relations website and has been furnished with the SEC. Also all of today's Analyst Day materials are currently posted on our Investor Relations site as well. On the front page, please scroll to the bottom, you'll see view all of the slides that will be presented here today.","We know it's a busy time right here in the heart of earnings season, so we've tried to keep the content tight, while also addressing a lot of the fundamental questions you all have been asking over the last year.","This meeting has been as you know in the works for quite some time. But we're pleased this morning; you'll be able to hear from our most seasoned executives as well as the newest members of our executive leadership team.","So, following the presentations from David, PJ, Mark, and Arlen, we'll have everyone grab some lunch that'll be set up in a buffet outside come back eat your lunch in here and we'll do a question-and-answer afterwards. And then we'll ask that you hold your questions until a mic gets to you so that we can hear it on the webcast.","As you would expect, we'll be making a number of forward-looking comments. Let me switch to the forward-looking statements where we inherently have risks and uncertainties. For this and more information on the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the back of the presentation material that's on the website or with our most recently filed SEC documents. This event is being webcast and is available for replay.","And with that, I will turn it over to David Henshall, our President and CEO.","David Henshall","Thanks Tracy and good morning everybody. It's great to see a packed house here and also welcome to everybody that's joining us live on the web around the world.","So, as Tracy said, we're going to give a formal update on the business and talk a little bit about -- more about really just the -- we've got the operations the products and the financial outcomes not just of where we are right now, but the status on the transformation we've been driving across this organization over the last couple of years, and then how to think about the rate and pace over the next -- really over the next five years or so.","Also give me a chance to introduce a couple of new members to the leadership team, really excited to have these folks joining the team in their new roles. Right after me you'll hear from PJ Hough. PJ has been with us for three years now. Some of you actually know PJ. PJ is our Chief Product Officer who runs all products across the company.","Mark Schmitz will come and talk about operations also with the organization for about three years now, but has stepped into a much broader capacity as our Chief Operating Officer, focused on really scaling people, product, systems, et cetera that are going to be necessary for us to continue the transformation going forward and doing it in actually an accelerated pace from where we've been over the last couple of years. And then, Arlen Shenkman, just recently joined as our Chief Financial Officer also running Corporate Development and Strategic Alliances across the Board.","So, we'll dive into each one of those areas and try to keep this actually pretty tight and concise over the next hour and a half or so. And as Tracy said, we'll open it up to get into a more interactive dialogue across the topics that are covered today and also talk about Q3 where it makes sense.","So, it's pretty interesting as you step back and you think about this company, I mean we just celebrated our 30th anniversary earlier this year. So, we've been at this for a long period of time. This actually covers -- pictures of covers in annual reports over that period of time. And what's fascinating is that we have really been focused on this fundamental value proposition of connecting people and information, doing that on demand and in a secure managed available way.","It's just been a real maniacal focus for us for our customers around the globe regardless of the shifts in the technology landscape and the types of pressures that all of our customers face across the Board.","It's allowed us to really create and lead in some pretty important categories around virtualization, app delivery, DDI how we're thinking about defining the broader workspace right now going into the future.","All of our customers have really trusted us over the years to manage what's mission-critical for their business, whether that's applications, business processes, information access, et cetera, and that's allowed us to continue to leverage this position of strength into where we are today.","So, let's focus to 2019. I'm really proud of the fact that we're now servicing customers in over 100 countries around the world. In fact we have hundreds of thousands of independent customers. Within that number, I'd say about 100,000 is what you consider to be enterprise-class organizations. Just about all of the Fortune 100 are Citrix's customers.","Kind of an underappreciated asset that the company has is the fact that we have ballpark 100 million people leveraging our technologies on a regular basis to access information to drive their business forward. That means those tens of millions of clients that are out there on endpoint devices that are running Citrix today.","It gives us a really unique Trojan horse to be able to deliver new technologies with a much lower level of friction and allowing people to consume that at the same time in a much easier way.","We finished this year somewhere around $3 billion in total revenue. You've seen the shift in the P&L which Arlen's going to talk much more about. Obviously, subscription ARR the best way to measure the progress of our transition has been on fire lately. It's approaching $700 million in total revenue growing at 40%. And that's just a clear reflection of what's going on across the financial side of the transformation of the business.","We'll exit this year with ballpark about two-thirds of new product bookings coming via subscriptions means we're well over halfway through that part of the transition. So, all of these headwinds to growth that we have talked about for the next -- well, really for the last couple of years are abating at this point in time allowing us to inflect and start driving up into the right from a growth rate standpoint.","And at the end of that you'll see a much cleaner P&L, faster growth, higher profitability, but much more predictable and easier for us to layer upon new incremental revenue streams from a customer point of view.","So, we had a lot of progress. And it's interesting it's actually my 67th quarter end with the company. And so I've seen a lot of these transformations with the business. And the one question I still get pretty constantly from investors is I don't understand why Citrix is still growing.","I thought apps were actually moving to the web. And so if that's the case what is the fundamental value proposition for Citrix? And so if I just net it out. And you saw this if you looked at the slides earlier today, just netted out a really simple almost financial terms for you. This is why we are growing pretty simply. And we'll talk about each one of these throughout the course of the morning; we'll drill down into that.","But at the simplest level we're addressing a much larger value prop than ever before. Customers have used us for virtualization historically. But as you look forward, it's really a broader story than that focused on mobility, focused on analytics, focused on managing devices, and a whole host of other areas around productivity and engagement. So, it's a bigger opportunity.","The customers that have been with us for a long time are spending more. We've done a progressively better job all the time, which Mark will cover around cross-selling products, so consuming multiple independent point products at the same time.","Penetration within those big customers is still growing. Virtualization is a growth market. It's growing. We created it, we leave it, and we're investing to maintain or even accelerate that lead going forward.","Despite the size of the customer base, we're adding thousands of new customers every year, about 3,500 year-to-date. So, we'll exit this year with probably 5,000 or so net new customers that we haven't worked within the past.","And then of course as customers start consuming some of these new services, most of these will fall under the banner of Citrus Cloud, we're going to add a lot of incremental value to them. Value in a way that could be everything from optimizing that existing virtual ops in desktop infrastructure they might have as a legacy customer to net new services around mobility, around analytics, around endpoint management, a number of other areas that we'll talk about more. So, at the end of the day, bigger opportunity, large and growing customer base, selling higher ASPs. That's pretty much the easy story.","So, the second part of that is well if that's the case, who's actually buying? Simple answer is just about everybody. Largest companies in the world rely on Citrix. It's a critical part of their IT and security infrastructure. There's a lot of conversation that I've heard over the years that assumes that we are just focused around financial services and healthcare which are important verticals, but they actually don't represent the majority of our overall business.","The other verticals of course where security and compliance is absolutely critical to their business and therefore, our solutions are a perfect fit. And they'll continue to be going forward.","Also the ways that we're able to really bring together the infrastructure that simplifies it for IT environments, so they can remove cost, so they can make it easier for people to consume information, so not just security and cost-cutting.","Left-hand side of the chart -- actually we skip over here. Talking about the types of challenges, this is probably an easier way to look at it because frankly this is a summary of most customer conversations that we'll have on a regular basis.","Security compliance as I said cost-efficiency. Those are all super important. Actually outside of this chart though represents what I guess people have probably described today as business transformation. It's an overused term that really encompasses a number of different areas. But it's focused on how do I get closer to my end user? How do I provide incremental services to my customers? How do I turn business agility from a project?","Imagine just on-boarding and off-boarding users, offshore development, M&A integration. These are projects, but they're becoming much more of a core critical competency for a lot of businesses because, the cycles that we're in are moving faster and they have higher volatility than they have in the past. So we no longer have the benefit of just thinking about these things as a one-off. It needs to be fundamental for the way a lot of our customers operate. And the workspace really supports all of these in a pretty pronounced fundamental way.","So, we step back and then we think about our customers. Our largest customers are extremely loyal in the business. Our top 10 customers as measured as those that generated the most total net bookings dollars in 2018, every one of them has been with us for over a decade at this point in time. And also, it's true for about 70% of the top 100. So, our biggest customers are very sticky. They've been with us for a long time. They're spending more money. Yet at the same time, as I said a minute ago, we're continuing to add more and more to grow the base of that pyramid and allow those to become tomorrow's largest customers.","And over that period of time, it has allowed us to really step back and deliver a very sustainable, very predictable growth from the business, up into the rye. And this was the picture you're looking at just the financial outcome since we're a public company roughly 25 years ago. In fact, this is true regardless of the various economic cycles that we've been in, the various changes in the technology landscape. Simple fact that we just added value to a lot of customers and our products are sticky.","The only two times that we've had a year that went down was due exclusively to a divestiture. Back in the 2001-2002 timeframe, we sold some products to Microsoft. And of course those of you who have been close to the company recently, 2017 when we divested the GetGo business to really focus maniacally on the broader Citrix Workspace strategy. So, that's how we thought about delivering the business over the last many years.","And I'd say, in the last two years, I would describe the company is focused on three big motions, three big transformations. These are the ones that I guess will usually be covered by PJ Mark and by Arlen going forward. But the idea of moving from products to platform, let me just give you a background in context. So about three years ago, we were organized across a number of different business units, product leaders et cetera. And we're building products which is great to drive incremental focus on those areas but it's really hard to drive more of a horizontal approach, a suite of bundle or platform. And so we reorganized the company.","We brought in PJ to run products wall-to-wall across the organization. We went from a product stand-alone to an integrated single business. And the outcome of that is we're able to operate with a much, much higher level of innovation than we ever have. Our rate of new patent filings is triple what it was at that period of time. At the same time, we're pushing out faster new product introductions at a much higher product quality index. So I'm very happy with the progress there.","On-prem to cloud is really about meeting customers along that hybrid cloud journey. We'll talk about what most people realize is that the pace of change inside of our customers is actually pretty slow. And this is really where the services inside of Citrus Cloud come together. Citrus Cloud today is a collection of roughly a dozen of services for those customers that are looking to move their existing infrastructure to the cloud. Those customers are looking to consume net new areas and even a set of solutions for those that just aren't ready to move yet, things that we can do to optimize your on-premises deployments because everybody wants to move. It's just the practical realities of doing that are so much challenging for a lot of customers. And giving them the tools to do that on their pace, while migrating them onto the platform gradually is a core part of the strategy.","And then of course, over the last couple of years, really accelerating the perpetual to subscription motion, which Arlen will go into with a lot more depth. So, it's important I think to just spend a minute, thinking about where customers are coming from and why all this matters so fundamentally to them, because, in the industry, we talk a lot about these different areas of technology. We always talk about mainframe to client server clients, serve to PC et cetera. And it was only about five years ago that just about every organization was entirely focused on that bottom era, I guess, we can call it the PC era, where data was on-prem in data centers were on-prem, core set of ERP systems it really brought together, all of the transactional information in the business. Data repository was inside the corporate network et cetera.","Then about five years ago, and it's really only been about five years that we have started to move into what everybody in the industry talks about is the cloud mobile era, where now devices are truly ubiquitous. And they're changing constantly all the time to be able to consume and pull information as well as sources of information that are feeding back into the infrastructure.","Services are now obviously a third-party, whether we're talking about just the latest SaaS services that's being acquired and deployed by the marketing department, as well as of a placement and disruption for a lot of the core systems that are out there. And then of course, infrastructure as it exists, in a public, private and hybrid mode. And all these things have created a tremendous amount of promise and opportunity of course, but for most companies, they're still living down at the bottom. I mean, this is what a large majority of their infrastructure still looks like today. And their pace to move forward is probably described more as glacial than anything else. It's just the realities of dealing with this.","So while at the same time, the promise of where we are is pretty pronounced and the complexity that this causes is also a big problem. This new area takes security and distributes it from the core corporate network out to the endpoint. Data security is now distributed. You're relying on your third-party providers for services and all of these other things. Your attack surface is dramatically different than it was just a few years ago. And so, the industry has created a lot of point products to help manage this fundamental set of problems. You see these apps come up all the time, productivity apps, things whether they're just new mail clients, business file, sync and share, others. And then of course tools to help manage and search across all this sprawl.","It's a terrible staff that today people spend about one day a week looking for information. An entire day just trying to find the latest file, the e-mail they were looking for because of all this distribution that's out there. Obviously, as people have moved outside of the office being able to understand who they are, what they have access to, what their rights are, created IM as a separate category. SSO is a way to abstract away some of that inherent complexity kind of put a skin on the top of it, so people can consume information with a little bit less overhead attached to it.","With device for all of course comes the need to manage independent devices. So a number of different strategies out there obviously, to lock down the device itself, really create a new corporate-owned device, manage the information that's on it, create multiple profiles, all the things that have happened around endpoint management of course.","App delivery. We know it well. Now obviously, it's created a way to help simplify some of these challenges from an IT standpoint. PDI is a great example that falls into this category as a way to bring all these disparate applications together in a way that IT can manage more effectively, can secure, can optimize, can deliver it and drive that forward.","Clearly new frets across the security landscape things that didn't exist a few years ago, but have really come up because of the availability of cloud services, the new work styles distribution, these are ever-changing and creating a fair bit of complexity because of all the promise that has existed within this mobile and cloud area.","Then of course delivering applications, app delivery networks and all of the associated services here, it's only been within the last couple of years that networking was something that we've had kind of in and out of the data center in a traditional way. Today, as PJ will go through more than ever, you've got a horizontal approach. We're connecting across data centers, across applications, across services. And they need to manage and maintain all of that is incredibly challenging. And it just makes it that much harder for all of our customers.","And so when you think about that customer that is living still a little bit in the PC or client-server era, managing all of this incrementally has caused a lot of complexity and it's slowing them down that much more. This idea of promise of all the power of the cloud in a lot of ways just forces more focus internally, trying to manage all of the piece parts, that exists here is an increasing challenge. And this isn't just about onboarding new technologies, but it's about the necessity to actually integrate them together, to hire people to maintain and manage these things. And the ongoing challenges it comes as they migrate at a different rate and pace going forward.","So, the reality though is that the typical customer in the Citrix Universe has over 500 applications, over 500 applications in their infrastructure operating today. Some of the largest financial services firms, folks that are represented here live in person, the number is 20 times that. I'll meet with a lot of the IT organizations for your companies and we talk about the thousands and thousands and thousands of different apps that are out there. And they're across all kinds of different architectures. It's not just consuming net new SaaS to actual mobile apps, it's across the gamut.","And the reality is that, most of these applications are still going to be here years and years into the future. They're just hard to replace.","Your IT organization is spending on average about 90% of the budget maintaining what exists today. That just leaves a little small sliver to try and drive innovation, adopt net new, really move the business forward. The needs aren't going away; just the complexity is underneath all that.","We work with customers. We had a customer conference just a few months ago. And so, whenever we're having the similar conversation, I always try to describe the data center. I use this archeological dig comparison. When we do that, the main point, the takeaway of that is, is that applications that you put in place years ago are still there.","They're still in the infrastructure. They just get layered on top. So all these great new applications you're adopting today, things that you think of as disruptive, are actually creating a lot more complexity in many cases, because they're layered on top of each other.","Great example, I was with the financial services company down the street about three weeks ago. We are going through what their new initiatives are. They're talking about business transformation and they toured me around, how they've redone a lot of their real estate in an open seating plan. And it's great. They're really trying to move forward, not only to drive their own business forward but to actually attract and retain this new generation of employees.","And as we finish the conversation, it segued into the fact that they still have mainframe applications that were built in the '60s that are running inside the data center, for a couple of reasons. One there's nowhere to put that information. They don't know how to do the data migration in the first place. And it's not a huge priority. It's still operating providing a fundamental level of value to the company. And so, even though they want to adopt all this net new, they still struggle with that challenge of complexity that exists.","It's a big, big problem. And when you put it together, all those piece parts that I showed you on that spidergram, the research shows it would cost a typical company about $1,000 per user per year. The promise of the cloud and all the cool stuff that comes with it, it is actually pretty expensive. And of course that's just in addition to the cost that they already had on maintaining and running the existing business.","So let's back to that whole run-grow equation that most IT organizations struggle with. Just too much money is spent maintaining the complexity that exists, not enough money to be able to simplify and move that forward. And so, that's the challenge from an IT standpoint.","What PJ will talk more about is that there's a lot of challenges on the demographic side as well, from the end user point of view. We've got huge shifts happening across organizations. And I'm sure everybody sees in their own company right now that traditional work models have really just evaporated pretty recently.","Less than half people are working inside of an office tethered to a machine. Everybody is a little different than they used to be. You have to approach almost every individual inside of a large enterprise today as a mobile worker, because they're working in different places, different devices, different work styles.","And some companies are actually employing this almost as a business strategy. I was at this customer conference, I was using eBay as an example, an example that they in-sourced some of their support as a way to just drive efficiencies and cut cost.","And when they in-sourced that, what they did was they leveraged Citrix's infrastructure to tap a part-time stay-at-home work force. The group that would never be in the office in a traditional environment, they can now access in a way to cut cost, way to drive more efficiency and actually bring them back into the workforce where they might not have been able to do that in the past. That's about attracting and retaining people.","And I'll tell you what I meant, spending time with not just CIOs, but a lot of CEOs, the reality is that we've got a global talent shortage right now. It's one of the reasons why unemployment is as low as it is. And when that happens, all that does is generate increasing costs at a pretty rapid basis and attrition keeps going up across the board. So we're looking for ways to just engage people more and more across the board.","We fundamentally believe that enabling people to do their best work is a technology conversation. Its things that we can do to engage people better, give them the tools to be productive on their terms. And a lot of that comes back to this idea of employee experience.","And we use this team pretty loosely. You're going to hear that over the course in the next couple of hours. We're not just talking about look and feel, but really fundamentally stepping back and understanding what are the things that people are trying to get done? What are the business processes that can be automated? What are the systems that we can bring together to abstract away a whole bunch of complexity for IT to allow them to go faster, allow them to cut costs allow them to be more secure?","That's a big part of what we're doing right now, because fundamentally it's a conversation much more about productivity and engagement. PJ will go into this in detail, but this idea of unengaged or disengaged employees is really a global epidemic right now.","Gallup has done some work and they talk about this as a $7 trillion problem, because most of the people are just not working that hard. It's probably not fair to say working hard, it's probably more fair to say they just don't have the tools, the systems to be productive where they need to be. We're making it just harder than we have to. That's one of the things that you'll hear more about, how we think about it and what we're doing to help solve and fix this problem.","It bears out when you call up some of the actual statistics about this. People will tell you, I got the right tools; I'm going to be very productive. I don't have the right tools, it's really going to hurt. More than half the people think that their tools are on the far right-hand side of this chart.","Stats will show you, the research that people are doing all the time into this idea of productivity, it's going to point out the fact that most people in a typical office environment are productive less than 10 hours a week. In some cases, it's less than three hours. So it's a pretty big problem right now and we're looking for ways to really drive that forward.","And so, part of what we're here to talk about today and for those of you that have followed the company much more closely is that, we fundamentally believe there are opportunities to solve these problems. We think there's a better way. That's the real idea behind the Citrix Workspace, the things that we're doing as a company to really bring this together.","And so it started with this concept of this spidergram, where we've got market-leading capabilities in a number of these point products. And so we thought, there's an easy first step to start to aggregate this together to allow a lot of our customers to pull out some of those point products and just consume the individual components that are part of the overall platform.","I'd say this is our first step. This is what we had talked about as organizing IT. So internally, we'll say, organizing IT is the first step. Bring these apps in these disparate pieces together. It's easier to manage, it's more secure, we can cut costs, we can drive that level of benefit for the typical IT organization.","Second phase, of course, is like, how do you organize work within that. And that's where the Citrix Workspace came together in its current form couple of years ago where it's now focused on a single unified and secure way to manage all applications, whether those are virtualized apps, SaaS, mobile, native, you name it.","Ways to connect into your information, your files, whether those reside in Citrus cloud, box, Dropbox or a number of on-prem repositories, but getting that single way to access that, solving some of that problem of searching for information, of course, making this ubiquitous across different device types so that devices can be transient, move in and out.","We build security within a lot of this, whether that's just security as a way to access, to manage devices, to enforce policies, et cetera. And as we do that, we've been able to collect an incredible amount of valuable information. Our analytics touches information that's happening across the network, the device, the app, the user and many other different attributes. And not just capturing that in a way where we can turn it into a report, but use it as a way to really close the loop and drive actions. And PJ will go into much more detail about that.","And then, of course, evolving our networking portfolio to really be focused on application delivery, application security and many of these things that really drive the workspace forward. So that's where we were moving from organizing IT to organizing work.","And then this last phase is what we've announced this year. And this is much more about how do we use that level of intelligence to really guide and automate work going forward and transform the workspace into this fundamental platform that is really targeted towards how do you add value across all employees, regardless of whether you're power users, you need all the power of virtualization, or frankly whether you're just an employee that needs a couple of SaaS apps and Office 365.","I need to add value across the entire spectrum for all applications, of course, and then using analytics in a more profound way to really drive a lot of those outcomes and actions and be much more predictive on ways that'll influence immediately the productivity of individuals.","And, of course, built entirely on the cloud, so that we can allow customers to leverage the infrastructure that makes sense, allow much more flexibility in terms of scaling up and scaling down as they look forward and manage that dynamically.","And to understand where we're coming from, let me just take a second to talk about, I guess, you call it our world view. But the way we think about technology inherently, because it's different than a lot of our competitors, do we assume that people are in the middle?","I mean, this is a little bit more about human-based computing. Thinking about the empathy for, not just technology, but what are people actually trying to do? What are they trying to get done? How do we make them more productive and more engaged? And so on the left it's -- I guess that's representative of different devices and sources of information.","We believe that devices are going to continue to be ubiquitous. They're very, very transient. They're always going to be changing. And the scope of which you just can't try to lock down. This idea of locking down a device in a way that kind of recreates a corporate-owned device, it's just going to create the opportunity for people to work around it. It adds more security problems, more complexity. There's got to be a more flexible approach to that.","Frankly, the same thing holds true on the infrastructure on app side the idea that these things are transient. Applications that are hot today may or may not be here five years from now. We see this transition on a regular basis, because we need to create that platform that allows people to consume new things as they come along, but also migrate into new areas in a much less frictional way going forward.","And of course, when it comes to the infrastructure and some of the other providers, the realization that your partners today you need that level of flexibility to continue to move and optimize where it makes most sense for your business, because most of our customers aren't selecting Azure or GCP or AWS. They're utilizing services from all of the above and they'll continue to do that for reasons that are important to their business. And those reasons may change over time. And it's important to recognize that as we build up our platform from the ground up.","And so just to really summarize this and just put it in a very, very simple terms, we're adding value in a couple of different ways. This is -- think about this is value for shareholders, revenue growth, profit et cetera. Over the years, we built a $3 billion business, largely based on virtualization. Unfortunate enough to attach networking is a form of virtualization or workspace delivery. But overall, we've only been able to touch about 30% of the seats inside of our existing base.","Now 30% of the available seats within our current customer base are Citrix customers. That number is growing each and every year. And we're doing things to continue to increase the average revenue per seat by adding in new capabilities around the Workspace platform, intelligence, optimizing SaaS mobile analytics et cetera. That's one vector of growth and we're seeing a lot of what's driving our resurgence in the last couple of years, really based probably on this single vector moving up and driving a higher usage for customers.","But the way to think about the platform as we describe it is much more about how we drive this wall to wall attach, really driving productivity across the board and that's creating that fundamental platform that I've talked about and you'll hear much more about that services the needs of all users, all application types really across any industry. We're focused on building a vertical platform that can much easier add incremental services on top of the seats that are existing today. That's where the less friction comes in and we can continue to segment users in a way that provides the most value for those individual customers. Whether those need yesterday's virtualization solutions, whether those are consuming Citrix TAZ or Windows virtual desktops or partner solutions that help verticalize and drive this going forward. That's inherent platform approach that we've been driving.","So we're looking to add value across both of these axis. And that's where the strategy is right now and that's how you should think about it as you listen to the next couple of presentations, because as we execute against this, this just allows us to grow our TAM pretty significantly.","As I mentioned today, internally we'll talk about virtualization as amazing technologies, but a bit of a specialized use case targeted towards the most complex, the most secure, the most powerful solutions and as a category, not just Citrix, but everybody. That category touches about 20% of the available knowledge workers in the world. That number is slowly growing. As I've said a couple of times, virtualization is a growth market and it continues to expand. But when we think about this, this is the simplest way to articulate the Workspace platform. It's like how do we not only grow the virtualization part of the pie, but obviously continue to expand around that entire circle. That's the untapped opportunity that we look at today.","And so the categories we compete in as measured by Gartner they're big. That's our traditional categories, virtual client, computing the ADC, business file sync and share et cetera. And whether these numbers are precise or directionally correct, the point is they're very big markets. They're growing. And we've got plenty of headroom to be able to expand into that.","But as we start to go through some of these areas we've been executing on over the last couple of years, you see this number continue to expand whether we're looking at more of a software-defined perimeter. It's a fancy term for networking being disaggregated away from hardware into -- moving more into software services and analytics, bringing in capabilities to secure SaaS applications more natively to connect people to cloud apps. It's the first click on the Workspace.","And then really we -- where we are today, targeting areas around productivity and integration and things that were just not possible when we were focused purely on virtualization, it further expands that overall pie. And so as we continue to execute forward, we're just going to expand our addressable market by as much as a factor of three from where we were just a couple of years ago. And that's were we're focused on driving forward. That's what you'll hear more about today.","These three big initiatives that have been really front and center across Citrix for the last couple of years. Products to platforms, which really extends our value in a number of different ways, the on-prem to cloud journey, which will support our customers across this hybrid approach, which will be dominant for the next several years, and then, of course, expanding our business model in a way that provides leverage, growth and predictability going forward.","And then lastly, I mean internally we talk about three primary business outcomes. These are the things that are inherent in a lot of our products right now with the focus on experience, experience for the end user and to a degree experience for the IT organization. Simplified complexity, make it easier to consume and that drives value productivity engagement. Choices about infrastructure, choice of device, choice of cloud providers and the recognition that those things will change over time, so it's critically important for us to maintain that, and then, of course, inherent security that is built into everything that we do right now both from an individual security product standpoint and a secure architecture.","So thank you very much. That's my quick introduction. Now I want to call up PJ Hough. PJ will do a more deep dive into the ecosystem and the product technologies.","PJ Hough","Thank you, David. Good morning everybody. I'd like to walk you through a little more detail on our product strategy and really position it in the context of what we see as the key trends in our industry, where the market forces are and what the big opportunities are for us and frankly for our customers as we move through this transition.","As David indicated, one of the things that we certainly see our customers getting which is the move to the cloud. And this has actually caused customers in many cases to reevaluate, not just how they get to the cloud, but what they do in preparation for getting there. And we recognize that for many customers, it's going to be a long journey and that there are things that we can help them do that really honor the environment that they're going to be in which is hybrid and multi cloud. And it recognizes the fact that they're going to maintain a significant footprint on-prem even as they continue on their cloud journey.","A second key focus area for our customers today and one that comes up in every conversation that we have is around security, enterprise security. And how customers deal with the potential of the opportunity of the cloud of the potential of a mobile and flexible workforce and at the same time providing the governance and controls that they need to deliver their business securely. And then finally, one that has I think resonated deeply with us and a conversation that we are having with every customer who's undergoing some form of digital transformation is how they think about the employee productivity.","The numbers that David shared are stocked with regards to how employees today are viewing the tools that they have to help them do their job. But maybe more importantly in a tight labor market, everything that you can do to attract the right talent, to retain the talent and then help them be productive, actually flows directly to the bottom line in organizations. And we see market differences between organizations that have managed to capture that employee productivity and organizations that are not quite there.","So I think the cloud journey provides a substrate against which we can talk about much of the transitions that are occurring in our industry. And it's not specifically just about the move to the cloud, it's about the mindset shift that happens in organizations when they go on that journey that causes them to reevaluate, the things that they've historically done, the constraints they've applied to their business and the way they've thought about how to operate their business. And how the cloud has somewhat liberated thinking across a wide array of elements of their infrastructure.","If you think about the world that our customers now live in with regard to moving to cloud they have a lot of choice. You look at the cloud platforms, you look at things like the hypervisors or how they think about building out their data center infrastructure. And for each one of these as the customers move on that journey to the cloud, you should not think about it as a like-for-like. The cloud is actually enabling new scenarios opening up new opportunities for customers to rethink how they engage with their employees, how they deliver services to customers, and how they operate their business.","A really good example of this is the work that we've done recently in partnership with Microsoft, around Windows virtual desktop on the Azure cloud. And it highlights that as you think about moving to cloud there are new ways to think about delivering windows as a service ways that we are familiar with and the ways that Microsoft has invested in that really demonstrate that both of us are taking a different approach to thinking about how that might appear to an enterprise customer in the future. So why don't we just take a moment and watch a quick video of Brad Anderson describing that partnership and the relationship between Microsoft and Windows and Citrix.","Video Presentation","So, I think Brad hit on a number of really key elements in here that, I want to highlight for you. The first is that both Citrix and Microsoft are partnering together to leverage the cloud to do new things and really, really reshape the way that customers consume our combined technologies. So I think that deep technical engagement is obviously foundational to our partnership.","The second thing that he talked about was our field engagement, and how we go to customers together in a way that actually brings the best of Citrix and the best of that Microsoft platform to the market. And I think I use that as a great example, because I think that nourishes the depth of our partnership, and collaboration that's occurring across the various aspects of our business, but also how that transformation is not just a replay of what we had in on-prem software and solutions. The cloud is enabling us to really rethink ways to do that and basically broaden the market for both of us.","So I want to talk a little bit about the quality of experience that David mentioned employee, mobility and I don't just mean mobile devices, I actually, mean the mobile workforce, the distributed workforce. And then finally enterprise security. When we talk to enterprise customers today there are these challenges that they face. We're in an interesting time with regard to the trends related to IT and enterprise in the world. We've actually hit a flat spot with regard to technology delivering productivity gains to organizations.","You can go back and map productivity improvements in organizations and output over the last several decades and you can map the key inflection points to the transitions to new technologies. Well, we've sort of hit a flat spot. We've now introduced a lot of new technology and we're not seeing a correlated growth in productivity. Something has actually flipped. A second key factor here is the shortage of talent. McKinsey estimates that in the U.S. we're going to be short 95 million medium to high-skilled employees next year, just in the U.S. alone. And the C-suite customer's that we've talked to say that 61% of them believe that access to developer talent is going to be an impediment to growth for them. And I use developer talent as a proxy for technical skilled workers as they sort of penetrate the workforce.","And then finally, we have this issue with low employee engagement. The Gallup number is startling. It's \u2013 the number could be as high as 85% of the employees in organizations are disengaged. That means that \u2013 think about it, 15% of your employees are fully engaged on helping you deliver your business. Well, and somehow we have to take a look at the IT systems that we've put in place, because they do contribute. The third highest-ranked factor by employees for why they stay at a company or why they leave after their salary and their manager is the tools that they have to do their job.","And when you think about the environments that we've given to users over the years, it's not fair to say that, that's where we are. We've actually heavily invested. You look at these large new complex cloud-based applications, we look at the deep investments that organizations have made we're just not seeing the return. It seems like we've substituted one set of issues for an equivalent set of challenges that users have as they move between old legacy applications and what I would even consider today quite modern and SaaS applications inside the enterprise.","At the same time, and maybe this is at the heart of the challenge we face. In the consumer world, we have all seen the technology evolve on a different path and in fact enable us to do things that are completely different. Think about the apps that we have that are tailored to our personal experience that have a feed of information that comes to me that matters to me and that helps me understand what's going on.","The number of apps that we now have in our personal lives that actually have notifications that appear at the right time that remind me to leave for the airport to tell me to check in for my flight that help me manage the stream of activities that I could possibly spend time on that actually organize them in a way that helps me organize my personal life.","Think about the number of apps that now have a one-click experience book the hotel room, reserve the ticket, select my seat. Most of us don't have that for booking conference rooms or other resources within our organizations by contrast. And finally we're now in our personal lives very used to interacting with services that actually are getting better the more we use them. They have recommendation engines. They help us find our next movie, our next book, our next album to download. And yet, at work we really struggle to provide those same tools to employees that help them guide themselves through their day at work.","And so this is really where we're focused on building the Citrix Workspace. We really have thought about the problem in a very different way with regard to helping deliver that consumer-like experience for our employees, across all of their devices. We think that's critical because in fact we see more device diversity than ever before. We also see people working from multiple locations on multiple devices. So, how do you maintain context for an employee such that as they move from working on the train to their office, to working from home that they actually carry their work with them in a way that makes sense. We want to simplify access to all those applications through a very simple single sign-on experience. So, that I don't really think about the fact that, I'm switching apps or accessing multiple applications.","David highlighted the problems of search and finding the right information. We believe that there's a better way to deliver the right content to employees that help them find the things they need to do their job more easily. And at the same time, we recognize that we have to underpin all of this experience with a security and performance investment that really provides that context for work.","So let me quickly show you what the key elements are in our Workspace experience. And by the way this is screenshots of our product that we will be delivering before the end of this year in that next wave of product delivery. So the first thing, you'll see highlighted in the intelligent experience is integration of assistance and search as a first-class experience.","We often know that people start their day by launching applications to look for work, but we also know that they often have a goal in mind. And how do you get that and from goal to action as quickly as possible? How do you make it easy for them to express what they need to do?","The second thing that you'll see here highlighted and actually given I would say private place in the center of the workspace experience is this contextual personalized feed of work that I need to complete within the organization. It's a balanced mixture of things that are pushed to me that I have to complete and do as part of my job and a set of feeds that are poised to me by me based on things that I'm interested in understanding and knowing about the organization.","And not only is this feed contextual it's also actionable. Right here you'll see in blue the verbs where I can approve or process the work right here within the feed. You'll also see that we've elevated recommendations in the Workspace. We actually understand the types of actions that might be relevant for a particular employee. What's the next best thing I do at work? Think about that moment, while you're transitioning from completing a task to doing the next task. How do you choose what to do next?","Of course, people still need access to their applications and virtual applications, SaaS mobile applications are all fully integrated in here into that Workspace experience. There will be times when you will want to go into a deep application as the starting point, but we also recognized that it's quite possible that you can accomplish many tasks based on the activities that are delivered to you in the feed.","And finally, we have embedded micro applications into that Workspace experience that allows me to get the next level of detail inside the Workspace so that I really understand what's going on.","Actually let's take a quick look at more interactive demo that shows exactly what's going on in the Workspace. Here you see that we've really highlighted the apps, the content, the files, and if I'm accessing a desktop that I have access to that here inside the Workspace. Remember this experience was across all devices.","But really our goal is to drive up engagement and productivity. Not just have the Workspace to be a place that launches applications, but a place that I go during my day to actually get work done where I'm presented with the actions that make sense for me, where I can get to see the information that's coming from the systems of record in my organization, but that's in a much more simplified and consumable way.","Think about this particular example of an expense report coming from a large ERP expense management system. Typically today, you get the e-mail that drives you into that application or you have to search for the right context in user interface. We're able to extract that in these micro applications and make it easier for you to complete that task in a much easier way.","There's also information that often needs to be shared with employees about new employees, new training courses, et cetera. We believe we can deliver a bunch of that.","And then finally actions in here where I can not only consume information, but I can interact with those systems of recording in this case creating an incident that's going to go back into a complex system of record. And if you want to know what that complex system of record looks like this is an example. This is what the IT person in ServiceNow deals with when they receive that incident that allows them to process it.","So this doesn't replace systems of record for deep use, but for the casual user the person who just needs to create the incident or who just wants to approve the expense report, we believe we can mine and extract those interesting workflows out of those applications and deliver them as consumer-like experiences inside the Workspace.","Of course, delivering that same experience on mobile is critical to this plan. When I think about my own day and move in between meetings that's often my opportunity to understand what's most pressing what needs my attention and allowing on a mobile device for me to easily observe this type of information and move quickly between my tasks and move the workflow of the company forward. I think that's really crucial.","Here you see that we've integrated a digital assistant into the Workspace that can answer questions that we all struggle with. You know, what's my vacation balance? How do I easily get access to training? What courses are available? And over time this will become more refined based on usage.","As David indicated, our world view is very much about putting the user at that center of the complexity and addressing the problem from the perspective of the individual user. And really when you think about that Workspace think about it as a tailored experience that adapts to my usage over time much in the same way that we have social platforms and social tools that adapt to our usage.","And so over time my Workspace and David's Workspace will be quite different based on our usage, our patterns of activity and what matters to us in our roles. And the way we've encapsulated that is by in fact putting that Workspace that personalized Workspace at the center of that overall experience.","Now what I've shown you looks a lot like an application, but in fact with the way that we have decided to build this is to build it as a platform. We recognized that as a platform, we have the opportunity to build the next layer of tools that apply to all users inside organizations and that can be integrated into all of the applications and workflows that matter to them.","And what you see here on the slide are a list of some of the other applications that we expect that will be integrated into this platform over time. They're just indicative of the fact that many organizations have many of these tools and need to provide a coherent and consistent experience that sits on top of all of them.","So what does this mean from a business perspective? Well I think the first thing it means is you will see us accelerate the Workspace adoption across a wider set of users inside the organization. The workflows that I showed you and that simplified experience are not constrained by the 30% of VDI use cases inside the organization. They are generally applicable to all employees.","And what could argue that our biggest opportunity with Workspace in that context is to actually address some of these broad corporate-wide workflows whether it's employee on-boarding or you're improving your interview process or simplifying the way that you manage performance or other capabilities that could be delivered to basically every employee inside the organization.","And so therefore we see potential -- significant potential for seat expansion inside our existing customers as well as attracting net new customers that recognize this as a brand new opportunity for them to think about the Workspace that they deliver as the platform for work inside their organization.","Except from a product perspective when I think about the waves of adoption that we're going to see the first wave is the one that we're experiencing right now and the one that's showing up in our financials which is that move to SaaS, the move to subscription and obviously we're partway through that and it's well, well underway.","The second wave is I anticipate, we will start to see customer broaden the use cases for the Workspace inside their organization and thinking more wall-to-wall about the usage and the benefits that they can get from Workspace. And of course this opens up huge opportunities for us to take that platform that we're building and integrate it to deliver that complete experience for the widest set of users.","And third, is we're really opening up that platform and leveraging how we think about the kinds of solutions that not only we build, but that enterprises and third parties can also build on that platform. Recently about a month ago we held our first-ever Citrix developer conference where we invited 100 developers to come to our campus in Santa Clara and sit with the Workspace platform and our core engineering team.","You read about it in our investor letter. It was a great successful event and I think it pertains a whole new direction for the company with regard to engagements with a new set of partners who take this platform and take it deep into organizations where they as partners understand the workflows and business processes and what really matters in vertical industries and in other geographies. So really that's the -- that I think is the waves of adoption and the waves of potential growth that we see for Workspace in the coming years a very exciting time for us.","I'd like to switch gears now and talk about our Networking portfolio. And what we see happening in Networking which is actually a very exciting time. It's very clear that the Networking industry as a whole is moving from hardware and appliance to software. This is partly driven and accelerated by the move to cloud where frankly you don't get to deploy hardware, but you do get to put software services on top of cloud platforms. ","Our investments over many decades in networking have all been software based. Even though we have delivered them as hardware appliances, our core intellectual property and investment has always been in software. And, therefore, this is a trend that we can participate in as customers move from an appliance on-prem based view of their network to a cloud and hybrid view of their network.","We've, of course, have optimized the Workspace to run on our networking stack and we have optimized our networking tools to deliver the best value, the most optimal performance and the most visibility and control of that Workspace experience. And we also see customers on the networking business transitioning also to a subscription model. You see this show up in the context of pooled licensing for our networking business.","So let's talk a minute about the technology shifts that are occurring and how they actually play to some of the strengths that we have with the assets we own in networking.","The first shift that we see happening is these large centralized applications when they move to cloud in many cases they're getting reengineered. They're getting redesigned to take advantage of cloud. Again this is another great example of how the transition to cloud is not moving from a static platform to an equivalent platform. Customers are using this as an opportunity to transform their applications that they build and leverage new capabilities that exist only in those cloud platforms.","I'm going to give it a quick example here that I think we'll all be very familiar with. The example is a very simple one of taking a photo and uploading it to a cloud service. When you take that photo today what really happens is it gets uploaded to the cloud service and we generally think, oh, it gets uploaded and it gets stored in the cloud. The reality there are new services that are getting built that process that photo in the cloud. An example is geotagging such that I can come back later and search for photos of Paris or New York and find the photos that I want, or maybe the photos are getting facially recognized, so that I can come back later and search for pictures of PJ and you'll find pictures that are all relevant.","These are independent services. They're all part of this much larger application that's being built in the cloud. And the way that they act is being constructed is not as a monolith, it's actually being constructed as a set of these micro services, these little applications. And what that really means is if you think about the traffic from a networking perspective, the traffic is no longer just flowing from my mobile device to the cloud, it's between all of these micro services inside the cloud. And so this new networking paradigm has actually not just permeated the edge of the cloud, it's penetrated the architecture of how applications are getting built.","And so when you think about an existing application that ran in a data center on-prem and now think about the places that people are building and running applications in the cloud, what you see is that that software element of networking now participates in many of these new environments. And this is the same technology. This is the same core Citrix ADC code base, the same core Citrix SD-WAN code base and that marks at the top is really where much of the magic is happening in cloud networking.","It is the fact that you now require a common way to orchestrate, have visibility and have control over not just the applications that are running in your data center, but also the applications that are running in cloud. And our customers, as they move to pooled licensing, have the flexibility to now take those applications on-prem, we factor them as they move to cloud and leverage that same subscription to Citrix Networking as they move the applications forward.","The policies that they enforce, the orchestration tool that they use to manage it, the visibility and control and security that they had from our networking products on-prem, all mapped directly into this architecture in the cloud.","And to the extent that you subscribe to the model that we do, which is on-prem stays for a long time while customers move to one or more clouds this model is going to be an enduring model for customers who consume Citrix Networking.","So in the same way that we saw the phased transitions occurring in Workspace, we see similar phases of adoption occurring with Citrix Networking. That first phase is really about customers moving to our subscription and moving to hybrid and multi-cloud. The second phase is really about rewriting those applications in a dramatic way, taking advantage of the cloud platforms and building these cloud-native applications.","I should comment that one of the things that has happened with the cloud native model, which is characterized by containers and technologies like Kubernetes is that those technologies have in fact in some cases flown back into the enterprise and back into on-prem.","So cloud native networking is not just applications running in cloud, its applications written to the pattern that's been popularized by the cloud. And so again we see even applications on-prem getting modernized using the same set of techniques and the investments that we've made are equally applicable to those on-prem applications as they are to the cloud applications.","And finally, we see the emergence of this new orchestration capability for clouds and for networks, which is that ADC gets delivered as a service. And that means that I have an intent based way of describing how I want my applications to perform and the orchestration of these highly sophisticated networking deployments of maybe tens or dozens or hundreds of instances of network, all can be orchestrated in a consistent way across my cloud, across my multiple clouds and my on-prem deployment. So that's a snapshot of where we see the transition occurring in our networking business.","Third, I'd like to talk a little bit about analytics and our investment in this area. Clearly this is a very exciting investment for us and one that underpins both the core of our workspace strategy and the core of our networking strategy moving forward.","There've been several significant changes that have occurred in the capabilities of platforms over the last several years that really make the potential of a new analytics platform come to life for us.","The first one is there is now a rich set of cloud-enabled AI and machine learning platforms that are available. And they really have changed the game with respect to the platform, on which you can build AI and machine learning enabled analytics and applications.","The second thing is as our users have become even more connected, we actually have a deep understanding of the work graph. We know what device you use, we know what network you connect to, we understand what applications we use, we see the content that you share, we understand where you're based, we've understand the patterns of work, and the more we understand about the people you interact with and the nature of work and combine all of that into analytics platform, it gives us the ability to offer enhancements to the environment on top of it.","And the final one is that we really do understand that context of work. When you think about the Workspace and us bringing context into the Workspace this really allows us to service new experiences for users that are powered by analytics in the background.","I want to give you a few examples of some of the -- I'll call them the services or applications that we're building on this rich, rich platform. So on the left what you see is the access to telemetry that we have that comes from our core products. And this is telemetry that we've been compiling and building up for many years whether it's the 100 million endpoints or the billions of data points we get from our traffic management solution or the petabytes of data that we see flow through our networking products on a regular basis.","We have an incredible visibility across users, devices, content apps and the network to understand what's going on. We've actually combined all of that into a common analytics platform and we're now building solutions on top of it that address specific problems.","The first one is how do we leverage that to make the environment more secure? Well, it turns out that user behavior analytics is -- pivots around the idea of understanding what's normal behavior for users and being able to recognize anomalies and deal with them.","And so what we have is actually built a system that not only recognizes when a user is doing something anomalous, but we actually have the points of control in the Workspace and in the network to intervene on the device. We can ask for a second factor of authentication, we can restrict access in some way, we can turn on recording so that we keep better track of what's going on. So in the context of security, we're able to deliver a much more comprehensive picture back to IT, because of the deeper understanding we have of the individuals in the organization.","Next, I'll talk about performance. I mean, this has often been a challenge for our customers to understand in a physical deployed environment, what's the performance like for an individual user. Is everyone getting the same performance? Are people legitimately complaining about something that's changed in the environment or not? And how do you arm IT with the tools that help them understand that?","Well, take that problem and multiply a tenfold by distributing the users, distributing the applications, allowing people to bring their own devices, and now try to get the same experience on top of that capability. And so we've really designed the performance analytics solution to address that incredibly wide and diverse set of infrastructure, application experience and give the IT organization a consistent and clear view of what they are actually delivering to their employees as an experience.","When you think about employee engagement and retaining your best employees, not only you have to give them great tools, they have to work. They have to work all the time. They have to work when I'm in an airport. They have to work when I'm trying to get work done from home, when I'm trying to get access to content, when I'm on the road or presenting to a customer. And so how do you understand whether or not as an IT organization your investments are actually delivering that correct set of capabilities.","And finally, I want to talk for a moment about productivity analytics, because this is the promise of taking all of this capability and insight and using it not just to drive what I would call optimization from an IT point of view, but to really drive productivity for end users and use this to feed insights to individuals that actually help them do a better job with working with the tools that are available.","We've already delivered security analytics and it's been adopted by many of our customers. We are on the cusp of delivering our performance analytics. And what you should expect to see is that productivity analytics is one of these investments that I think has a much longer tail in some ways, because we've just opened up a whole new way for thinking about how to leverage that analytics platform to deliver new capabilities to end users. And the more we engage with users inside the Workspace and the more we understand about what they're doing the more you'll see us invest in creating capability that delights users inside that Workspace.","So really on the left you'll see the capabilities that we're delivering from the analytics platform that are targeted at IT. But on the right, I think the long-term objective here is to really unlock the potential of that analytics platform to really deliver new capabilities to individual users.","How do I recommend the next best thing you work on? How do I anticipate the content that might be relevant to a project that you've been assigned to work on so that I promote that content and make it more easily accessible to you? How do we suggest things that you might want to go look at? People in the organization you might need to get in touch with? How do we begin to understand the opportunity for automation?","I met with an enterprise customer last week who told me that 98.5% of all expense reports get approved in the organization. Yet every expense report gets multi-layered, multi-level approvals that go all the way up and down through the organization.","Isn't it time that we thought about sort of reimagining how to make an approval process? Help us identify the anomalies? Not bog down with the busy work of approval? How do you separate those things and sort of modernize the way that we think about that? One of those activities like approvals can we automate and still provide the same level of governance and control and visibility to organizations.","We will understand more about how people use the framework and the applications we've built. We'll know which micro apps are the popular ones. We'll know where to invest more. We'll be able to guide IT to tell them, there's a set of activities that your users are working on that may not be as optimal as you could have them. We can guide ways to even guide the IT to help improve this overall experience.","So I think this gives you a sense of the relevance and importance of this very powerful analytics platform in the way that we are thinking about delivering not just new value to IT, but also really game-changing experiences inside the Workspace that move very much away from application launch and much more to a guided work experience platform for guided work.","Before concluding, I wanted to talk a little bit about ecosystems and our role in the ecosystems that exist in the IT landscape today. We started out by talking -- I'm hearing from Brad talk about our relationship to Microsoft. And in fact it's a very comprehensive picture of our participation in that overall Microsoft ecosystem, whether it's running our workloads on Azure, building together capabilities of Citrix Cloud integrations with Windows Virtual Desktop, our integration with OneDrive, the Office applications integrated into our Workspace experience or in fact our shared investments in device management an end-to-end comprehensive picture of our sort of relationship and engagement model with Microsoft.","It turns out though that we have other ecosystems, where that picture is just as comprehensive. And in fact with Google, we have the same relationship on Google Cloud, their G drive integration, their Google apps, and in fact that same device management posture for the devices in their environment.","If only life were simpler enough for our customers that they could choose one of these ecosystems and run their business, the reality is that most of our customers for a variety of reasons end up choosing both of those ecosystems and then having to deal with the places where they're not identical. It just not bodes through ecosystems, it turns out that there are other key ecosystems that we see in the landscape here that make this world a little more complex for users and in fact prevent them from picking a single vendor strategy that meets the needs of all of their users.","And ultimately, I think this is where the power of the investments that we're making at Citrix in our Workspace and then our underpinning networking really provide that integration platform for all of these ecosystems and applications that exist in your landscape.","Take a moment to look at this slide and look at the applications that are on this, and try to determine how many of them would have been on this slide five years ago, or how many of them will be on this slide in five years' time or will have been replaced by something else. The application landscape is one of the most dynamic inside an enterprise organization.","And having a partner that understands how to absorb new applications into the platform, deliver them in a consistent way with the existing applications you have, marry the mainframe from the 1960s to the modern SaaS applications that you've just consumed, deliver that in a consistent experience across all devices, across all your networks for all your users that really is the mission and vision of Citrix and the Citrix Workspace.","So when I think about bringing together all of our technologies clearly the Workspace is the prominent user experience that everybody sees. And that really is the embodiment of the strategy of the company. It is underpinned in a very critical way by our investments in networking that really help provide the security, the performance, the visibility in fact the confidence that IT needs to deliver that great Workspace experience.","And then the insight that we get from analytics drives not only the IT experience to evolve and deliver that in a better way, but over time it will also drive the user experience inside the Workspace leveraging our visibility and understanding of the vast set of information and data that we have in our customer deployments.","So with that, I want to thank you and I would like to invite to stage our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Schmitz.","Mark Schmitz","Thank you. So good almost afternoon everybody. I'd just like to give you a little bit of context for the role that I'm playing. As David mentioned, I've been with Citrix now for about three years and in this extended capacity for just a couple of months. I think there's a few items around my background that makes this fairly relevant to what it is that we're doing as a company in order to build on what PJ and David have already gone through.","So I've started in the early 2000s with Ariba, and I was fortunate to go through several of the transformations that helped build that company into what it ultimately became. The first was around extending from a single product into a suite of applications and the solutions for our customers to consume. The second obviously had to do with the movement of those from an on-premise business in a perpetual model into the subscription business that ultimately led to the acquisition of Ariba by SAP.","In SAP, I had a good fortune of also spending a little bit of time helping drive the operation for building the subscription business into what was a very healthy and long-standing perpetual business. So, helping SAP through that motion of expanding their customers who are very heavily perpetual and maintenance-based into consuming and driving subscription services.","So today I want to talk a lot about that. How we're actually transforming the Citrix business to help our customers realize the value that PJ just described. What are we doing internally to help build the cadence in operational performance to ensure that we're ready for our customers to move to the cloud.","So, I'll talk about a few of our key internal focus areas, the opportunity for our customer base. I think David mentioned we have an extremely loyal and powerful customer base. We need to extend that customer base to bring them into these new capabilities, so they can obviously grow with us as we expand.","I want to talk a little bit about the benefits that our customers are receiving as well as the expansion opportunity for us as a business. So, to focus a little bit on what it is that we're focused on as a company; number one is our go-to-market. This transformation started back in 2017 and we stand now today with internal processes and the salesforce that has been enabled, trained, and understands what it is we need to do to deliver subscription to our customers. Now, the salesforce is only one element of our go-to-market motion.","The second is around our channel. Our channel has also had to grow from their previous reseller type relationships in one of our ecosystems such that our channel partners are not only helping us position these solutions with our customers, but also helping our customers extend those capabilities and continue to drive them forward.","So, we spent a lot of time making sure that both the channel and our salesforce are working together. And as we focus on what's next for the channel, there's really two strategic areas in 2020 that we want to make sure is firing on all cylinders. The first is with our systems integrators. The SIs have a tremendous opportunity through this platform of digital transformation to work with our customers to take their applications, to take their infrastructure, and begin to move and migrate it to the Citrix Cloud.","Once that's done the work is not over. They have a tremendous opportunity to continue to grow all that application landscape and move those to the cloud while using Citrix as the front-end to really simplify the experience for those customers.","Our platinum providers as well our platinum partners are specialists in Citrix. They have long-standing relationships with our customer base and we believe they'll be able to make a significant improvement in helping us take what has not traditionally been our focus to-date, which is the installed base migration to the cloud.","We've really been focused on selling new licenses to our existing customers and new customers as well but really helping pull that installed base over into the Citrix Cloud and subscription world.","The next is around customer success. As we move forward in our subscription transformation, we know that customers are no longer making one-time buys and going off on other devices to run. We're playing an integral part in actually running and executing those platforms on their behalf.","In order for us to form a more strategic relationship with those customers, which is actually very important to a motion around expanding as that customer grows, we do invest in resources that are helping customers understand the change from just virtualization that they've been doing for a long time to many of these expanded services that I think David and PJ have both touched on.","So, we're making a significant investment to really get in front of our customers, understand what they're doing, understand the value that they need to do in order to get the employees engaged, to get the solutions adopted, and continue to grow their Citrix footprint.","And then lastly a key area of our focus is around pricing. We want to make sure that we're selling customers what it is they need and leaving on the table room for incremental expansion. We want to sell them a platform we want them to use and adopt that platform and as we see additional use cases that can help that customer grow, we want to make sure we're selling them that incremental capability as an add-on service such that their overall footprint can begin to grow quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter.","Moving on, I want to talk a little bit about what David mentioned earlier which is our installed base. As you can see from this Slide, we really are very diverse in terms of where our customers sit. This has a couple of pretty positive advantages. The first to really isolate some of the risk in any of these sectors having an interesting economic event. It allows us to really broad and be quite diverse in terms of the use cases that we see with our customers who are driving this technology into execution.","Our teams are able to look at each one of the customers that operate in these different sectors and actually build on those use cases and through that customer success vehicle really go out and help customers adopt new use cases. When customers adopt new use cases, we see seat expansion because we know that we can touch incremental users within the installed base.","If you look at another view of our customer base, we can see that seat penetration is averaging about 30%. That's a tremendous opportunity for us to go into our customers who are already getting lots of benefits primarily from our virtualization services and extending well beyond virtualization. So our virtualization is excellent because it continues to grow. It's a growing market.","Citrix has the ability and we're actually growing beyond what the market is doing today. We have the ability to add these incremental services onto that virtualization base and continue to grow those seats. Now in areas where we're even more heavily penetrated areas like health care, we still have plenty of opportunities. So at 50% penetration we can still do lots of things.","And a customer example here that I was involved in just a quarter ago was Springfield Clinics. They have been using electronic medical records to virtualize those and their physicians were using them. They had a CIO move out and their CIO -- or their CEO was looking to create a digital platform transformation and they relied on Citrix to do it.","So not only did we expand the Workspace, give the customer much more capability than they had prior we're actually able to extend that to every single employee within Springfield Clinics and go wall-to-wall, bringing the capabilities of Workspace for even those users that didn't necessarily rely on virtualization.","In terms of increasing our average transaction size, these seat expansion cases are doing exactly that. So as we go into customers and sell the power of the workspace, we're seeing those customers actually expand the users that are now leveraging the Citrix platform. This is driving a 20% increase in average deal size from what we've seen over 2016.","Workspace is helping drive this expansion and the added products around analytics, files mobility provides easy growth opportunities for us on top of the growth platform. Traditional users also are gaining significant benefits. Those users who may have been using virtualized apps or desktops are constantly beginning incremental capability from the product organization that is increasing the value of the applications that they're using. And this has afforded us not only the opportunity to increase the average transaction size, but also in our largest transactions we've seen 30% growth in million-dollar transactions.","Now the chart that you're looking at now is actually done in average contracts, our average annual contract dollars meaning that we're selling three and five-year transactions and as Arlen will explain a little bit later this is having a significant positive benefit in our unbilled bookings that you see -- that you don't necessarily only focus on when you look at our total growth.","Now customers wouldn't be doing all these things if there wasn't significant value in it for them. And it's not the value that we just market or that we just show on slides customers actually have to realize this. And if you look at the move from on-premise into the cloud we're delivering on the first thing which is to lower the total cost of running their Citrix environment. So by moving from an on-premise environment into the cloud we're seeing over 70% reduction in cost.","The employee experience we've heard so much about today those employees that are actually making choices on where they're going to work were seeing an 88% improvement in their engagement driving productivity even higher. And I think David mentioned that there's over 500 applications that many of our customers are actually using and have variable to their customers and roughly 34 of those applications are being touched by any individual user. There's a significant loss of time in figuring out which application use and when.","The Workspace is helping deliver those applications to the employee at the right time helping increase the overall productivity and obviously driving a significant positive return for those customers who are moving to Citrix Cloud.","But I'd like to just share one customer story here from EBSCO that may put this into a little bit more context. ","Video Presentation","Mark Schmitz","Sort of the really interesting things about this particular customer story, as they share something that may if our customers we know are going through. That is a very complex mobile hybrid cloud universe, by which they\u2019re using multiple cloud providers -- sorry, I won\u2019t turn off \u2013 maybe even multiple cloud providers to actually run and digitize their business, but they're using Citrix now to place that in front of them.","And what I'd like to show now is really the bookings profile from this customer. So, they've been a long-time customer, a very good and loyal customer. You can see that they made consistent purchases over the last 10 years. Workspace helped us engage with this customer on a more strategic level. This allowed us to make a massive transaction that will actually partner with EBSCO to help them over the course of their future.","And this one-time transaction doesn't necessarily mean this is the end of their subscription growth. They have not bought everything. So if we go back into seat penetration, we have the opportunity to continue to grow. They mentioned that they were a conglomerate of over 40 companies as they acquire additional companies, it allows us to go sell those incremental users.","At the same time, we've simplified their ability to deliver applications to everyone of these companies by using Citrix Workspace. Now this is a bookings chart, but the most important thing to also understand here is that we've doubled the revenue on an annualized basis that this customer will deliver us -- to us versus the business as usual when they're merely buying as a tactical provider. And this expansion motion is really at the key to our subscription business.","You can see there's a little bit of curvature to the blue line, which represents new landed accounts. This is primarily driven by our seasonality. But, on the green line, which represents the expansion, you'll see that it begins to be very smooth up into the right. But this is because as we land a customer account and we're able to display and deploy the capabilities, there's very rapid adoption of the solution.","As the solution is adopted, we continue to see customers expand on an as-needed basis, not necessarily driven by the original seasonality. And this expansion is a true indicator of the health of our customers that are actually driving within our Citrix Cloud. And expansion is also driving multi-product solutions.","So as we go out and drive into our customers -- again, they don't necessarily own all of our 12 services that are in our cloud. If they're a customer who is only a virtualization customer, we're able to carve out the capabilities that they need and sell those incremental capabilities to their users through the Citrix Cloud platform. This is really leading the way to allow us to go into a multi-product solution for each one of those customers.","A great example here is Safelite. Safelite is a company that actually fixes broken windshields in automobiles. They have a tremendously large call center, whereby people call in to get their windshields replaced they then deploy a car out to the actual site so they can fix your windshield on site.","Prior to Citrix, the call center did in fact run on Citrix. But with Workspace, we're able to create the mobile experience for those vehicles that have then gone out and done the work to replace the windshield and bring everyone together into a single environment.","We then extended actually further with Safelite back into their insurance transaction processing group, which allowed them to then take the windshield that had been replaced and go further and extend the benefits to their insurance company.","So, to further expand on this let's look at one more customer example that shows what a deep relationship can do for us to expand that solution end-user community.","Video Presentation","So, I think this story represents a couple of really great use cases that put Citrix Workspace at the forefront of what we're capable of delivering. They talked about mergers and acquisitions and using Citrix really as the front-end to simplify the end-user experience for either company that is part of Worldpay, such that the end-user\u2019s experience is relatively simple while the back-end IT organization maybe relatively complicated as they figure out how to merge and integrate those systems together.","The second is this story really articulates how there's significant value beyond just virtualization and that the Workspace itself engages the employees and gives them a significant benefit when they come to work each day. They're truly using this to transform the way that they operate and ensure that their user experience is successful.","Now similar to EBSCO, you'll notice that the bookings opportunity for this customer was relatively flat over the first three years of our experience. Upon delivering the Workspace solution to them, we were able to sell them a much larger commitment over a three-year period. And again, in this particular case, we've driven the recognized revenue on an annualized basis well over 200% from where it was in the prior year. And these cases really show a very strong ongoing relationship with our customer and that's leading us to improve renewal rates as a company overall. So, we've spent a lot of time making sure that with our customers that are going to stay on-premise, that we're providing them significant value. So, we've done a couple of things. We've not only provided increased services with our standard support, but we're also building premium support options that range between 10% and 25% more on an annualized basis to give customers the same hands-on strategic relationship and experience that we're providing for our cloud customers. And over time, we'll begin to see the installed base reduce.","As we accelerate our transition motion which has not necessarily been the primary motion for our sales force and we actually go target existing customers, begin to move them to our Citrix Cloud, we should see an acceleration that will decrease the number of total users in the on-premises world, but obviously increase in our cloud environments. As we do that, I need to double down on what we're doing from a customer success perspective.","I mentioned this earlier that the key is actually enabling our customers to move to the cloud. Once they do that, we are spending a significant amount of time with those customers to ensure that they actively adopt the solution.","Active adoption means that we not only secure that customer for the long-term, but we also see a significant opportunity to continue to sell them incremental value-based services and expand the overall seat licenses that they're using, such that from a renewal perspective, we actually end up not in a transaction event at the end of their contract, but instead in a discussion about how they will accelerate and expand their current user community.","So with that, I'd like to invite Arlen Shenkman, our CFO to come finish the story.","Arlen Shenkman","Thank you. For those of you, who I haven't met, I'm Arlen Shenkman. I was with SAP for 15 years. I spent time as the CFO of North America as well as running corporate development and global partnerships. I was responsible for driving the inorganic parts of SAP's cloud transition, which included ensuring we had the right partnerships, relationships and investments in place to scale the business.","When I was the CFO of North America, we were able to double our cloud revenue to over $2 billion. I'm excited to be joining Citrix at this stage in its journey to the cloud. As you heard from us today we're focused on execution. We have work to do and like any transition to the cloud, there are always going to be periods that are marked by changes to our business model and changes to our financial performance. But that said, as many of you know, what emerges from the other side is often a faster-growing and ultimately more profitable company and one that adds significantly more value in its sustainable business.","So why don't we flip to the third quarter? As you know, we released our numbers this morning. The headline numbers were strong relative to our guidance and consensus for revenue margins and earnings both subscription and SaaS revenue accelerated to 43% year-over-year growth. And importantly, we continue to see strong growth in our ARR with subscription up 40% and SaaS up 52%. We believe ARR is a key metric for measuring our transition and I'll talk about this more as we go. We did see a slight tick downward in our total subscription mix for product. This is entirely attributable to the improvement in our SSP business. Overall, we're pleased with our third quarter results.","I want to remind you that, Citrix has come a long way. The business has been executing on a significant transition for the past three years. Our mix of subscription as a percentage of total product bookings is 58% this year, which is more than four times, where we were three years ago. Workspace is shifting even faster hitting a 75% mix in the third quarter. Subscription is now more than 20% of our total revenue and we're seeing significant growth in ARR as I mentioned.","As a result of the changes in the business model over the last three years, we're at a point where we see 2020 as a year in which we accelerate our revenue growth, and hit an inflection point in our business transition. As we progress through the subscription transition, we know it's important to show you where we see the arc of the transition and how this transition will impact our financials.","I want to highlight to you where we are today and where you can expect us to continue going. We expect 2019 to be the bottom for our year-over-year revenue growth. We expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2020. We expect 2020 to be the bottom in terms of operating margins with margins beginning to accelerate in 2021 and really hitting stride in 2022.","The key driver for our operating margin guidance is the impact of gross margins as we scale our SaaS business and I'll drill into this in a moment. We have ranges here for 2022 through 2024, and we'll finalize our 2020 guidance with our 2019 year end results in January.","Looking ahead, we expect to phase out new perpetual licensing for Workspace over the course of 2020 while providing customers that need on-premise licenses, a term subscription license. Overall, as you can see, our subscription acceleration will increase the long-term intrinsic value of the business by driving growth on the top line with operating leverage and scale falling to the bottom.","Let's turn to gross margins. Gross margins are a significant lever in the model and the main driver of our 2020 operating margins. We thought it would be helpful for you to get a better sense as to how we're thinking about this, particularly since we have a couple of dynamics that affect our gross margins.","First, we had an increasing mix of SaaS, which is a headwind to gross margins. However, as we continue to scale, we see those margins beginning to pick up. On the other hand, the networking business, our pooled subscription offering is sold with an appliance, making networking margins relatively constant over time. Longer term, we believe we have an opportunity to improve our gross margins as we scale the overall business.","As you saw in the earlier video with Microsoft, our relevance in enterprises continues as the IT landscape becomes ever more complex. Citrix remains the undisputed market leader in virtualization, which is a growing market. Our heritage in virtualization is yielding an enviable footprint across a wide array of large enterprises.","There is no doubt that this diversified footprint is a core reason behind the resilience of the business across economic cycles. This also provides us with an incredible opportunity to expand within our customer base as we layer in new features and functionality. Citrix has a solid foundation to increase our footprint with our existing customer base.","Workspace will continue to be a stable driver of growth for Citrix. With the third quarter reported workplace revenue, we are confident that mid to high-single-digit growth is the right way to think about annual Workspace growth with acceleration in the outer years.","As you saw from our third quarter, new product bookings in the Workspace grew double-digits and Workspace is now 75% subscription for new bookings. Citrix is uniquely positioned to tap into the potential of our customer base while also solving significant productivity and security pain points for our customers.","As our Workspace becomes more of a platform, it will be easier for us to layer over incremental revenue streams for customers segmenting users with technologies like VDI, Desktop-as-a-Service, Analytics and more.","Over the course -- of course, the Workspace is a major driver for our subscription growth and will continue to represent a significant part of our journey to the cloud. Yet, our overall transition to the cloud is accelerating as measured by SaaS bookings revenue and paid subscribers.","It's worth noting that there are considerable differences in the rate and pace of the migration of our Workspace business relative to our Networking business. While both businesses are transitioning, Workspace subscription bookings were 75% of total Workspace product bookings whereas network subscription bookings were 29% of total network product bookings this quarter.","We expect to exit this year with 60% to 65% of new product bookings from subscriptions. And with the Workspace already at 75% and increasing, we expect the headwinds to revenue growth to lessen over the next year.","Our subscription revenue continues to grow. We ended last year at $455 million of subscription revenue. The growth -- this growth represents a three-year compound average rate of 33% and the SaaS portion of our subscription revenue continues to grow, ending last year at 60% of overall subscription revenue.","The primary driver of our subscription revenue growth has been the consistent strength we've seen in our SaaS. Q3 subscription revenues grew 43%, year-over-year. SaaS revenue as of the end of the third quarter represented 63% of our subscription revenue. Let me drill down a little deeper into our SaaS revenue growth.","To date, SaaS growth has been largely driven by selling new seats, to new customers as well as selling new seats, to existing customers. In other words, our SaaS growth has not been driven by the migration of existing customers.","The other point worth noting is that, we're seeing very strong growth from our SaaS Workspace. The Workspace is growing considerably faster than our overall SaaS revenue, which includes the more modestly growing content collaboration offering.","We expect the concentration of Workspace in SaaS to continue to increase. In 2017, the Workspace represented less than 20% of our total SaaS revenue. Today, exiting Q3 that number has climbed to over 50%. And is by far the fastest-growing portion of our portfolio. ","I want to spend a few minutes discussing the economics of our subscription transition. It's important to note, that we are really going through two transitions, one in the Workspace business, and the other in networking.","We are driving our business transactions and our long-range plan to these assumptions, on pricing economics for new subscription deals. Let's look first at the pricing economics of a new Workspace deal.","For Workspace we believe, on average our breakeven point for a subscription transaction versus a perpetual transaction will be 2.7 years. On the networking side the economics are different for a new customer.","Here it's gone to 3.5 years into the subscription transaction we hit the breakeven point versus the perpetual transaction. The key is, in both scenarios we exit with substantially higher revenue.","Let's shift from the business economics of the subscription model, to how this transaction is impacting our financial statements. Let's compare a three-year perpetual transaction with a three-year SaaS transaction and see how they impact our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow.","Let's start with the cash flow impact, which is reflected by the blue bars. In the perpetual license model, Citrix has historically billed upfront for the entire value of the contract versus a SaaS transaction, which is billed annually over the life of the transaction.","Now moving to the balance sheet, short-term and long-term deferred are represented on the orange and red bars, in the perpetual model. It's important to point out, that in the SaaS model, unbilled or pink bars are created, and these represent the value of the booking that has not been billed.","Note, that no long-term deferred or red bar is created in the SaaS transaction. Finally, from a revenue recognition perspective, the green bars are very different in the model. As you see the short-term deferred rolls, off the balance sheet as revenue is recognized. As the examples show, the impact of our bookings, coming from subscription will cause total deferred, to continue to decelerate, and unbilled subscription to grow.","So now that we've seen the economics and an example of, how the model impacts our financial statements. How should you think about measuring our business? One metric we've talked about is future committed revenue.","It's important to understand that in perpetual deals, we were almost always successful in billing upfront for the entire value of the contract including initial maintenance, which could be purchased for up to five years at the time of the initial transaction.","We benefited on the face of our financial statements from the short-term and the long-term deferred revenue, reflected in the upfront billings of these contracts. Today we are generally writing three-year SaaS contracts, billed annually which are not shown on our balance sheet.","While it is useful to look at future committed revenue, it's important to note, this is impacted by contract duration. This is why we believe ARR, is a more accurate measure, of the success of our transition.","The bookings mix shift. And the deferred revenue recognition means subscription revenue is expected to cross 30% of total revenue next year. We expect more than half of our revenue to be subscription by 2022, and this will approach 75% of total revenue in 2024.","We expect our product bookings after 2024 to be subscription. As we progress through this transition, we know, it's important to help you by anchoring around an important metric, like free cash flow per share.","Let's start with an important takeaway here. What we're reconfirming our commitment to achieve $10 per share of free cash flow in 2022. We wanted to share with you the correlation we expect to see between the mix of subscription revenue and free cash flow per share.","We believe the accelerated transition to subscription, jump-started by the phasing out of new perpetual licensing over the course of 2020 will allow us to achieve our 2022 targets.","We will exit the transition with stronger revenue and free cash flow generation. We believe ARR is perhaps the most single most useful metric to measure our performance in any given period. It normalizes for duration and is forward-looking.","I want to point out that not everyone defines ARR in the same way. Our definition of ARR is a bottom-up metric, built from actual customer contract data which we believe is a great forward-looking metric.","ARR captures how well we sold new subscriptions as well as how successful we were in renewing existing subscriptions, while removing the impact of duration and accounting and the impact of other accounting measures.","There are three components of subscription ARR which are consistent with the components of our subscription revenue, SaaS, subscription term licenses, and transaction-related activity, or what we refer to as Citrix service providers.","As you can see, we are seeing very consistent, robust growth in subscription ARR. And our growth is faster, when you look at SaaS ARR. We believe, ARR is the most important metric in measuring our success, in this business model transition.","We want to give you a view as to how we see the business evolving, over the next several years through the course of the subscription transition, and how we envision the business post transition.","Subscription revenue, the phasing out of new perpetual Workspace licenses in 2020 will drive an acceleration of our subscription mix -- of our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue.","We see this as a 50% to 60% mix in 2022, and 65% to 75% in 2024, exceeding 90% post transaction. We also see subscription bookings, being in the 85% to 90% range after 2022. ","In revenue growth we expect to see an improvement in our revenue growth from the bottom we hit this year. So a moderate increase next year of 3% to 4% accelerating to north of 10% per year, after 2024.","On operating margin, we expect 2020 to represent the low point of our margin profile with our long-term margin acceleration between 34% and 35% after 2024. As you can see, we expect what emerges on the other side to be a more predictable, faster-growing, and ultimately a more valuable and sustainable business for us.","We remain vigilant in focusing on deploying capital to drive long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We think of capital allocation in three primary categories. Our dividend, returning capital with a target of 75% of free cash flow in the form of share repurchases.","Historically we've done this in the form of regular programmatic purchases as well as accelerated share repurchases from time to time, and M&A when it adds value to both our business and our portfolio. And as you will see, this has resulted in significant capital being returned to our shareholders.","We have returned more than $5.5 billion of capital to our shareholders over the last five years. And will continue to do so. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Our capital return programs have resulted in a significant decline in our shares outstanding.","And as you saw in the third quarter with our announcement, our board has increased our share buyback authorization to $1 billion. So in summary, we want to leave you here with three key takeaways.","The first is that 2019, was a revenue low point. And in 2020, we expect to hit an inflection point. And our revenue growth will accelerate. ARR and subscription mix, are the key metrics we will use, to measure our success.","And are the best indicators of where we are in our business model transition. We remain committed to $10 of free cash flow per share in 2022. And we will continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders.","Thank you for your time. Let's take a break. Grab lunch. And we can answer some questions.","Break","Mark Schmitz","Yes. And start -- open Q&A here. Just -- we'll kind of make it interactive and there'll be handheld microphones that are moving around for anyone who has questions just raise your hand, we'll bring a microphone to you. We're going to do the mic just because we've got -- we're webcasting as well and we want to make sure that everybody online can hear the question at the same time. And I think it looks like we have about 30 to 45 minutes. So with that why don't we just jump right in. Sorry.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Unidentified Analyst","Thank you for hosting us today. It was a really excellent presentation, a lot of detail and we really appreciate that. I had two questions on the same topic which is, sort of, long-term growth how to assess it and how to think about it over time? In terms of just assessing the growth of the business, I understand subscription ARR does all the right normalizations. I understand that. But it seems like a big part of the story is actually moving the maintenance base to subscription over time. And so I was wondering if we shouldn't have a view of what that maintenance base ARR looks like today and how that might influence the overall growth rate? If you put those two pieces together what does that growth rate look like? That's the first question.","And then on the second piece if I look at the, sort of, long-term guidance and I look at the impact of the subscription bookings made the last two quarters, it suggests that you guys are growing in the high single-digits today and that it's going to continue for a prolonged period of time which is great sustained growth. What are the drivers that are going to allow you to sustain it because you're a $3 billion business? So sustaining growth at this scale is typically not many companies can do that. So is it pricing? Is it seat expansion? Is it the analytics story? What's going to give you that sustained growth over time? Those are my two questions. Thank you very much.","Mark Schmitz","Sure. Let me take the second question first, if my microphone's on. So if we think about the overall growth rate of the business you just take a big step back and look at the underlying markets that we're operating in. I mean, the largest one and of course the largest installed base is around virtualization. And that market is growing in the mid-to high single-digit range. And so the opportunity continues to expand.","And then I would point you back to those -- that slide that I had at the very beginning of my section where I just called out the fact that our customer base is expanding. We're addressing net new opportunities outside of our core markets that allow us to tap into new sources of budget revenue, et cetera. We're adding new customers. And then as we migrate folks to Citrix cloud on the new customer side you looked at Arlen's slides about how that customer lifetime value accretes over a multiyear period of time.","And then on the installed base piece, I mean, we didn't talk too much about that today, but that's because we've been intentionally focused on net new versus installed base migration. That will start to pick-up. It's been accelerating in the last couple of quarters and it will pick-up going forward.","The uplift that we see from what a customer is paying today versus where they're going. We've actually been yielding well over our target in the first few quarters. We're not talking about that as much simply because of the scale. And over time we do expect that that uplift will come closer to our 30% uplift targets, but there's a huge opportunity there.","And so as of today we're well below this 10% threshold of what would have been the installed base a couple of years ago that has migrated. I don't think we're going to break out an additional ARR metric. I think the broader subscription and subset SaaS really brings that all together. But overall, the categories we're participating in are continuing to grow in that mid to high singles. And so if I even step back and look at net new product bookings year-to-date across the Workspace and Networking in particular they're growing double digits and that's the best indicator.","And the first part of your question I'm sorry, did I answer that as well?","Unidentified Analyst","You did.","Mark Schmitz","Okay.","Mohit Gogia","Thanks for the presentation guys. It's really a lot you gave there. I so appreciate all the color. Mohit Gogia from Barclays. My question is for David and also PJ, if you can chime in. So initially, I think, you guys discussed that seat penetration, increasing that level of penetration is sort of like a core growth vector in the coming years obviously.","And I was wondering if -- and the platforms are moving from a solution -- set to a platform or other point product set or platform set is sort of like going to allow you to increase that seat penetration. But I'm just wondering many other vendors your competitors, obviously, and many other vendors we cover talk about that platform sell motion, right? So what makes you confident from a customer conversation and from your sort of, like the access -- the data access you have right now with the solutions. What makes you confident that Citrix is uniquely positioned to be able to provide that platform set?","David Henshall","Yes, let me start there and then PJ can add on. The -- a couple of things make us confident. We've been talking about platform it's not a new strategy. It's how we've described the business over the last couple of years. And really what that is thinking about virtualization as a component part of the ability to address the needs and users -- the needs of all users across the enterprise. So it's more about this general purpose and special purpose is the terminology you probably heard us use over the last few years.","What gives us confidence is that for 30 years now customers have entrusted us to deliver their most mission-critical applications. Those applications of all designs. And within that --those things are relatively transient. I mean when you hear people use a platform today, most of those are frankly applications. And you look at the most prevalent, most popular apps from five years ago half of those we don't even use anymore.","And so they -- our point of view is that we need to provide that level of infrastructure where those can come and go over time. We've got 100 million people right now plus or minus that are using Citrix infrastructure today to be able to connect them from their enterprises and people and do it in a secure managed way.","That's -- and in many ways, that's almost a Trojan Horse that allows us to reduce the level of friction to be able to introduce new technologies to that base but also making it easier for them to consume those at the same time. PJ?","PJ Hough","Yes, let me just build on that. So I do think that thinking of our existing installed base and the virtualization footprint as a beachhead from which to build out the new set of capabilities is actually critical to us. And it's not just in terms of deployed technology. I think it's also about our understanding of that market, understanding of applications, understanding of that delivery. And what it really takes to succeed on the dimensions that we talked about, which are actually quite diverse and continuing to expand whether it's networks devices, platforms users, et cetera. So I think that's kind of key.","And then I think the second part is we've taken a very specific and I would say unique perspective with regard to focusing on making the individual successful inside the organization. So we're not really building a collaboration platform. We're not building something that is a shared experience for everybody. We really are trying to develop a point of view that says, having a tailored experience for the individual is the thing that's going to be a differentiated point of view over time.","And that requires you to have a lot of insight about what makes my role in the organization different or special or how I behave relative to other users. And this is where you're correct. Analytics is actually kind of key. We don't think of this as an orchestrated experience built by IT for the users. We think it's a curated experience that they initiate but then that that evolves over time based on my usage of the system just like all of the sort of modern platforms that we use today in our personal lives.","So I think it's a combination of I think leveraging the expertise and footprint we have with virtualization as a starting point but then having made a set of deep investments, particularly around analytics and insight that I think really drives us in a very different direction to some of the other players in the market.","Kirk Materne","Hi. Kirk Materne, Evercore. Thanks for the presentation today. I really enjoyed the platform overview. I think that's really helpful in terms of where your vision is going. I was just kind of curious maybe David and Mark could take this.","Just in terms of getting to that vision with customers and the go-to-market routes you have to have with them I think are very different than where you were five, 10 years ago, meaning this is a much more strategic discussion. It's maybe with the business owner not just the IT part of the business.","Where are you in that transition? Is the partner side of the equation set up yet, meaning are the Deloittes, the Accentures is going to make you all, the platform that helps customers stitch all this together?","And then maybe just one last one for Arlen, just on the return of capital to shareholders. Maybe what's the thought process on not taking the dividend up just to create a little bit maybe a broader investor base that would come in and look at Citrix not only as a growth vehicle but also maybe as an income vehicle? Just maybe the thought process on that, so two questions. Thanks.","David Henshall","I can talk to the go to market. So we started on this journey two years ago, when we started talking to you about getting to the C level executive, having a more strategic relationship and we have been transitioning the organization not only from a capacity standpoint but from a skill standpoint.","And so we've been on this journey for a while because we've known where we're going. Certain geographies aren't where we want them to be like maybe Indonesia is not -- with 200 million users is not where we want it to be. But our major geographies like Japan, Australia, the U.K. those have clearly started to make that transition. And our sales force has complemented that, right?","With that said, our partner organization, we've also been working on. And again that is somewhat of a journey but our partner organization, particularly our best partners have come along with us in a very rapid pace. And we are going to invest significantly on the systems integrator side because building micro apps around a platform is hugely valuable to them and to us and to our customers. So we're on that journey. But like you said, it doesn't happen overnight, right? So Arlen?","Arlen Shenkman","I'm not sure -- we thought a ton about dividend in terms of our long-range plan and planning for years. So I mean, certainly open to a conversation if you want to think about it. Honestly, I mean obviously, you -- it's apparent once you have a dividend its forever. And so there's a little flexibility financially.","But frankly in terms of this presentation, and how we're laying out, where we're taking the business, we didn't spend a lot of time thinking about the dividend.","David Henshall","Maybe I'll add, maybe one comment on the system integrators and on platform.","Kirk Materne","Okay.","Arlen Shenkman","Because I think it's important. I think one of the things that we realized when we began exploring this space with customers was the pace at which they would want to go, to build solutions on the workspace, was going to outpace what we could do, if we decided to build all of the integrations ourselves.","And so that's really the point at which we've basically flipped to thinking more about building as a platform, opening it up, and frankly creating market opportunity for industry specialists, and geographic specialists, to go deliver complete Workspace solutions, into corners of the market that frankly we couldn't reach any time soon.","So really that's a key part of our strategy is not just building that platform, but engaging with that community. The developer conference that we had, we had 100 attendees.","And it was one-third corporate IT developers, so who we want to ensure are capable of building solutions inside their own organizations, one-third ISVs who build solutions that are commercial, that we wanted them to build their solution on the Workspace platform, and integrate with us, and one-third global system integrators.","So very much a target for our platform, and I think one of the accelerants for growth, and taking this into some of the broader deployments.","David Henshall","In the back.","Karl Keirstead","Hi. Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank way in the back, maybe this question is for Arlen. Arlen your stock increasingly trades on cash flow. And so, I'm sensitive to your outlook on that metric.","And I'm frankly surprised by the acceleration you're modeling in free cash flow to $7 to $8 a share in 2020. That's way above what I was thinking.","And my base assumption at least was that, the weight of this transition would much like it is on margins carry through and weigh on cash flow next year, but that doesn't seem to be the case.","And you're suggesting that this year's a trough on free cash flow. And we get a fairly market acceleration next year. So do you mind just unpacking that a little bit? And what gives you that confidence? Thanks.","Arlen Shenkman","Yes. So I think look there's a reason there's a range in there. And there are a lot of moving parts around the transition, right? So we still have a subscription license. We have a SaaS license. We have customers who are continuing to come off of the Network business.","So there's a lot of moving parts in there. So I mean, I think, that that's one piece of it. We remain confident that as we go through the transition, those parts will continue to add value.","And then as we accelerate into that subscription transition, the cash will become much more significant. So in the short-term, I think, there's a range in there because of that. And in the long-term we feel confident we can get to the target of $10 in 2022 because of the ultimate transition.","And this year there's a little more room in that kind of swim lane. But we remain confident we can get there.","David Henshall","Okay. Karl, let me just address that specifically. And so one of the things that Arlen talked about in his presentation was, we ripped the band-aid off about three months ago to really drive a more rapid transition of -- especially the Workspace business.","And you saw that coming out of this quarter, at 75% of the mix. And we've been trying to thread the needle for far too long on that. And really holding back the pace of the transition and we are actively going to migrate that to 100% of that business, plus or minus next year.","So accelerating the transition allows us to get through that trough much, much faster. And the amount of cash that is effectively coming into the P&L, versus being deployed, hits that equilibrium point and starts to drive the acceleration going forward with the acceleration of revenue growth et cetera.","Karl Keirstead","Got it, thanks a lot.","Ittai Kidron","Hi, over here. Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer again, thanks for the presentation. It was very helpful a lot of details. Clearly you've made great progress in -- on Workspace kind of driving that through SaaS.","And it's clearly, translating and having a big impact -- positive impact now finally on your numbers. My question is on the Networking side of the equation where you're far earlier in your transition there.","Help me compare and contrast, how I should think about the Networking transition going forward versus Workspace. Where are you in the portfolio and getting that transition accelerated from this point going forward?","That's going to have to carry a little bit more of the mix change going forward. And is there also sort of like a hard break-off that could happen over there in the same way that you intend to terminate perpetual licensing on the Workspace, could that happen on the Networking side as well?","David Henshall","Well PJ why don't you talk about -- remind everybody where we are from a product standpoint. And I'll come back and talk about the licensing side.","PJ Hough","So I think you're correct that we're -- it's not just we're earlier, I'd say the market is earlier in the transition to basically that software-defined cloud-based networking for enterprise customers. I think you really have to think about what's been happening with cloud in sort of two camps.","One is either net new applications that have gotten built on cloud platforms or new entrants into the cloud platform market. But for existing enterprise customers and their largest state of applications, that is a much earlier stage with regards to figuring out how to migrate. And frankly, that's the one where we participate the most, because it is really customers trying to protect the deep investments they've had in the delivery of those applications as they bring them into the cloud.","So from a road map perspective, I would say, we're well on our way to delivering the capabilities. And we actually have customers who, in Q3, were further down my waterfall model, basically cloud native networking customers who have bet exclusively on our Citrix networking solution. But they are, I would say, leading indicators of that transition, it is much earlier in stage. And so, that's I think where we are from a product point of view.","The part I feel good about is, given that we have strong software assets that are highly deployable across all the form factors you need, whether its appliance, or it's a container, or it's a virtual instance, or in fact bare metal, which we are now doing with some of the cloud platform partners. We believe that we can deploy the type of networking you need as you -- as the customers get there. They're just not there yet. And I think that's partly where we are.","I'll make one comment before I turn it over to David on the licensing, just my perspective, which is, given that there's a hardware component, I think it's going to be -- the transition to full subscription is going to have a different pace based on that. And that hardware business, as we talked about in a hybrid world, actually has some endurance. So that's still something we have to keep in mind.","David Henshall","Yes. I was going to reiterate that point as well. I mean, it's -- the underlying market is going to change at a much different rate and pace. So if you look at our disclosures, we've moved about 30% of new bookings towards subscription where we were roughly 10% or so a year ago. So it's moved up pretty quickly.","I think net new product bookings last quarter, for example, grew mid-single digits, somewhere in that range, which is probably in line with the overall market growth for that part of networking. But over time it's going to look more and more like software and subscription. And so, that is our expectation.","So how quickly we can get it above 50% is still a bit of an open question. That's one that is -- it's harder for us to force, just given the hardware components and other things. And one of the reasons why we continue to pivot those businesses a little bit away from being an ADC solution much more towards Workspace security Workspace delivery and optimization across really where people are going, versus just changing the architecture of where they've been. So that's probably the way I would infer that out.","PJ Hough","And we put the commercials in place to make that very attractive for our customers, right, so -- ","Mark Moerdler","Mark Moerdler, Bernstein Research. I want to thank you very much for giving all the data. That was a difficult process, explaining, building out all the data and everything else. And I think there's a lot here that can help people really understand what's happening in the transition and the fact that you're ripping the band-aid off on the process.","Two questions if you don't mind. The first is, Arlen, I would agree with you that ARR is the key metric people need to look at. One of the questions we do get from clients is the question relating to deferred and the other metrics that people have historically looked. And that when you have an Adobe style move from license-only to cloud, you get this big lift in deferred.","Can you give us a little color on why that's lagging a little bit in the process of how it's not growing or growing as fast as some people might expect? And then, there's another quick question beyond that. Where are you at this point in maintenance transition on Workspace? Is it 10% of the maintenance has started to move? Is it a smaller number? Any sense of where you are I think will help people realize how much still is ahead of you? Thank you.","Arlen Shenkman","Let me take the deferred and then I'll hand it over to Mark on the maintenance. On the deferred, so it's this piece of the business which is the pre billing on the deferred. So it's the headwind in the deferred. And so what -- essentially, because of those five-year contracts, because there's so much was pre-billed, because there's a history of that, then that builds up a significant amount of current and long term deferred.","And so, it's that headwind in the business that we're trying to eliminate so that we can come through this. And that's really what's driving the change. And I totally get that it's different than Adobe and Autodesk and everyone else, because very few people have the ability.","Most people, if they could prepay maintenance for five years, if you could get that cash in the door, you do it any day. It's just not a market practice anymore and we just have people continuing to do it, which is causing this kind of a lot of the two, which is confusing the story.","Mark Moerdler","That helps.","David Henshall","Yes. Let me put a fine point on that because I think it's an important one. So, just to reiterate that, I mean customers historically not only have purchased a perpetual license, but on average, a couple of years of initial maintenance. And two-thirds of those would have paid for the entire thing up front. Now, we're moving the entire business model to annual billings. That's why the growth in unbilled revenue has just accelerated so rapidly at the expense of deferred revenue. So, we talk about future committed revenue is kind of the combination of those $2-plus billion right now growing about 13% year-on-year. And those are -- that's really the one place that plus the impact on cash flows obviously in the short term are the areas that you see this pronounced change.","Arlen Shenkman","Then to answer your first question, I make around the installed base, we're somewhere between 7% and 8% of the maintenance base has begun to transition. Part of that though if you go back to the go-to-market portion of my presentation, it's because we've really enabled the sales force and directed their incentives towards new business. Over the course of 2020, we'll be opening that up such that the acceleration of the transition, the maintenance base should transition at an accelerated pace to where you've seen it to date.","Mark Schmitz","Next questions.","Mark Schilsky","Mark Schilsky, UBS O'Connor. Arlen, I think you said earlier that you were going to end perpetual licensing next year. When is that going to happen? Or are you going to put out an announcement to your customers sometime before then get them ready for that.","Arlen Shenkman","So, we're in a process now of ensuring that we have the right internal communications which we've started to cascade. We're obviously working on our compensation plans to drive behavior. We're working with our partners to drive behavior. We're not going to give an exact date. I can tell you that, we're obviously incentivized to make it happen as early as we can from a financial standpoint. We'll obviously be considerate of what's happening in the channel and the marketplace. And to answer your question, we've already started a cascade. We've already started to communicate and we're already -- we already have plans around how we will help accelerate that, but we're not going to give a hard date.","David Henshall","And just to be very clear on that point. We are not eliminating on-premise deployments. I think everyone knows that a lot of our customers are on a long cloud journey. And so, there's plenty of choice in terms of how they consume our products on-premise. A lot of those will probably utilize a term-based subscription as we go forward and we'll do the right thing for our customers. But when we're talking specifically about the financial model, this is the acceleration that we've started in the last two, three quarters and we want to drive that through next year.","Heather Bellini","I wanted to ask a little bit about -- Heather Bellini at Goldman Sachs. ARR is obviously an important metric as you guys all cited. I'm wondering, if you've given any thought to changing what you guide to and actually start maybe guiding to ARR as a metric that people can benchmark you off of. And then secondarily, we do get asked this all the time Dan and I were just talking about this.","You get questions from people where again going back to the deferred question, everyone understands they pay you less up front then obviously that impacts long-term deferreds versus people who were paying you up front before. But from a short-term billings perspective, I think that's one area if you could flush out a little bit more about the typical contract value or the dollars that you're taking in? I know you did that slide, but I'm just thinking about it from a short-term deferred perspective. So people can put that into perspective when they're thinking about that and how it impacts the cash flow. Thank you.","Paul Hough","So I'll defer to you on the value of the contracts. I mean on the ARR guidance, look, it's a new metric for us. We're obviously -- we started it two quarters ago. It doesn't mean we wouldn't provide guidance, but I don't think we have an intent right now as we get more comfortable with it, we'll think about that. But right now, it's a brand-new metric for us and we'll continue to report it and we'll consider that. On the pricing piece I'll give that to you?","Mark Schmitz","Well, I'll only add to his comment. As we go into next year, our incentives will line up with that whole thinking as well, so as we go to our sales force, it will line up specifically where he's at today.","Paul Hough","And then just on deferred, it's going to be a combination of long and short-term deferred will be impacted by seasonality contract what we're building up front how much is consumption based that we're building on a monthly basis. All those factors play in and that's why we're going to continue to give all the pieces, so that you can see all of them together in the context of future committed revenue.","A \u2013 Mark Schmitz","Next question. Any more questions?","Mark Schmitz","All right. It looks like we've actually reached the end of questions. So with that let me just say on behalf of Citrix and all of us up here, a huge thank you for everyone for participating here today. I appreciate you being here in person. I appreciate everyone who is joining us online. I think we're at a really interesting inflection point in the company's history right now and we're very much focused on driving this transition over the next couple of years. Thank you very much. Talk to you again in the next three months."],"5466":["Citrix Systems, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Citrix Systems Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session period. [Operation Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Eduardo Fleites - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Doris, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's second quarter 2016 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be Kirill Tatarinov, President and CEO; and David Henshall, Chief Operating Officer and CFO. This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems investor relations website. The webcast will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the US securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.","Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on the company's Investor Relations website. Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release, and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I'd like to turn it over to David Henshall, our COO and CFO. David?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We continue to show great results from the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We are focusing all of our energy on our core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, allowing for this consistent execution and really setting the company up for profitable growth as we look forward.","As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q2, with product license up 7%, and SaaS up 14%. Adjusted operating margin was 28%, adjusted EPS was $1.20 per share, up 20% from Q2 a year ago, and we also generated $228 million in cash flow from operations. In total, we closed 61 $1 million plus transactions across product and service, an increase of 33% year-on-year, with particular strength coming from financial services, healthcare and cloud verticals.","There was also good balance across the portfolio, more than half of these transactions coming from Workspace Services solutions, an increasing number from Delivery Networking and even our largest ever single contract around enterprise file sync and share.","From a geo, perspective, excluding the GoTo business, revenue from the Americas was up 11% while EMEA and APJ both declined modestly. The Americas geo has continued to really be the growth engine for a number of quarters now. This region is where our restructuring activities began early last year and therefore has had the benefit of stability and continuity, a key contributor to this performance and a model for changes we're making elsewhere in the world.","So, next let's look at our Q2 results within our primary groups. Our Workspace Services business, including app virtualization and mobility grew about 2% to $412 million, including a 1% year-on-year increase in license revenue. The results show that this business is benefiting from the strategy and increased focus applied last year. And as we've discussed before, there's a number of specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, more verticalized solutions and aggregation of our unique assets.","Within this area, there's a few dynamics that are worth noting. First, total revenue from the Workspace Suite, which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery, was up more than 70%, contributed about 12% of license revenue. Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew 37% to an ARR of about $75 million. And finally, we saw great results coming out of the Americas geo for overall Workspace Services where license revenue grew 23% in the quarter and 16% for the first half, really led by demand from the suite.","Next, looking at our Delivery Networking, total revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $195 million, with license growth of 16%. When you focus just on NetScaler, I'll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of three segments, cloud infrastructure and service providers, Citrix solution sales and enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud customers continues to be really strong, consistent with what we've seen over the past year. This segment contributed about half of NetScaler product bookings.","Solution attach sales represented 15% of the mix in Q2 with the number of app and mobile opportunities that included Networking as part of an overall Citrix solution, consistent with what we saw a year ago.","Enterprise ADC was about a third of the mix in the Q2, and we're seeing increased traction from the new NetScaler SD WAN products, which is addressing a nascent market, but one that's expected to grow really significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold over 1,900 Networking customers in the period, with over a third of them being net new.","And finally, our SaaS delivered revenue was up 14%, contributing over $200 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo Solutions was $169 million, growing 10.5% from a year ago. As we announced earlier today, we're merging this business with LogMeIn over the next few quarters, but until that transaction is completed, we'll continue to operate as a consolidated entity for reporting and guidance purposes. More detail on the performance of the GoTo businesses, individual segments will be included in the LogMeIn S-4 filing which is expected later this quarter.","Looking back on the other core Citrix cloud-based services, they contributed $33 million in total revenue, growing at 30%. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform, and other new services addressing mobile, networking and desktop needs for our customers.","So clearly, we're beginning to see a shift in the way that products are being consumed by our customers, evolving slowly towards a more consumption-based model. When we include revenue coming from the CSP program, our cloud-based services, excluding GoTo, and any term licenses, the aggregate ARR was over $200 million in Q2, growing at more than 30%. We'll begin to break this out each quarter to provide more visibility into this dynamic.","Shifting gears and turning to operations, we've shown a rapid increase in margin over the last few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain go-to-market areas. Our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions, allowing the company to execute more efficiently while also driving scalability into the future.","In Q2, we posted 28% adjusted op margin which was up 370 basis points from a year ago. We're clearly operating well ahead of our stated goal of reaching 30% in fiscal year 2017.","The focus on leverage has also really helped increase cash flow from operations, which was up 13% in the quarter to $228 million and up 31% on a trailing 12-month basis. This translates into approximately $1.46 per share in the quarter and over $7 a share over the last four quarters.","Before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for the remainder of the year. Our operational programs and strategy is clearly working. We're happy with the results and confident in our plans for the balance of the year. At the same time, we're going to remain conservative given the restructuring, the GoTo merger and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in the first half of this year.","That said, we're going to increase our assumptions for Q3 and for the full year. For Q3 2016, we now expect revenue in the range of $820 million to $830 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.18 and $1.20 per share. For the full year 2016, we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.37 billion and $3.39 billion and adjusted EPS of $5 to $5.10 per share. This range represents 3% to 4% growth on the top line and more than 15% growth in adjusted EPS. I'll remind you that this guidance represents all businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo merger.","So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to give you further color on the quarter and to focus on the areas looking forward. Kirill?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, David. I am very encouraged by our performance this quarter. It's a clear signal that our focused execution on the strategy to deliver the world's best integrated technology services for secure delivery of apps and data is resonating well with our customers, partners and the market. Our product teams have delivered on all commitments, enabling us to make a number of powerful announcements at the Synergy event in late May.","Specifically, we announced and delivered XenApp and Desktop 7.9, new NetScaler with an option to deliver it in a docket container and also brand new management and analytic system in NetScaler and also ShareFile's new information rights management, amongst many other advanced capabilities.","We've also announced our renewed and stronger-than-ever partnership with Microsoft, and most importantly, we shared our strategy to become the leader in Workspace-as-a-Service and accelerate our move to the cloud. All these announcements and product delivery received resoundingly positive feedback from all constituencies. Our innovation and partnerships are clearly fueling the continued strength in our execution and position us as number one or two in all market segments where we play.","Adding some comments to the Q2 results that David just shared, I'm very pleased to see that our Workspace Services business or Xen family is delivering growth, reversing past trends and clearly regaining market share. This quarter, our rate of growth in net new customers for XenApp\/XenDesktop reached strong double-digit growth year-over-year. XenMobile contributed strongly to the overall suite. Last month, Citrix was yet again positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites.","On our transformation to the cloud, the growth in ShareFile reached 30% year-over-year in new sales, and our Citrix service provider business continues to grow at a rapid pace, 37 percentage points year-over-year, primarily delivering XenApp and XenDesktop as a Cloud service, but also now adding XenMobile and NetScaler as Cloud service as well. We clearly see the Cloud as a strong growth catalyst for Citrix, really positive sign as we continue to focus on the evolving Citrix Cloud strategy.","Overall, this was a terrific quarter for our worldwide sales team. Particularly our Americas team executed extremely well in the quarter.","We just completed a comprehensive review of our operations in EMEA, and we see strong opportunities in the region, of course balancing it with all the geopolitical headwinds. We're seeing some strong wins in Asia Pacific and Japan and we have high growth aspirations for that region also.","This was an incredible quarter adding new customers to the Citrix family, but also solidifying our existing customer relationships. We also saw significant growth in large deals, as David mentioned, and we saw strength in our targeted industry verticals, particularly financial services and healthcare, with nearly a third of our largest wins represented by healthcare organizations.","A significant number of customers are moving from other virtualization and networking vendors to Citrix. In fact, we have nearly 800 combined competitive wins or replacements against our top competitors in Q2. Amongst more noticeable competitive wins in Q2, Kettering Health Network, a long time competitor's customer with more than 12,000 employees and 2,100 physicians, chose XenDesktop for VDI deployment. In another win, a major short-term housing provider in the United States selected Citrix cloud delivered XenApp and XenDesktop to support business critical applications in more than 180 locations. These wins serve as a nice example of XenApp and XenDesktop returning to growth and regaining market share.","Our renewed and strengthened Microsoft partnership started to bear fruit already in this past quarter. We worked with Microsoft in an engagement with a cellular carrier owned by LG Corporation. It was the largest ever deal closed in Korea for Citrix, with 29,000 licenses being deployed to help enhance security and productivity.","On strengthening our existing customer relationships, one of the world's largest investment banks, a long-standing XenApp and XenDesktop customer, moved to allow (14:23) Citrix to its worldwide operations, encompassing more than 200,000 employees. The bank's decision to choose Citrix was heavily influenced by our unique ability to execute virtualized Skype for Business and this was only one of many such examples. Microsoft recently issued a technical guidance, making an unambiguous statement that Citrix is the clear choice for deploying Skype for Business in virtualized environments. We anticipate that our partnership and alignment with Microsoft will provide us continued additional lift in end user computing.","On the network delivery side, CNA Insurance, one of the largest commercial insurance companies in the United States, replaced an established competitive networking vendor with Citrix NetScaler, making it the cornerstone for their networking infrastructure. CNA chose NetScaler to provide good quality end user experience to their employees and the mission critical applications. Essentially it is an ADC scenario in the enterprise.","And finally, ShareFile continues to provide itself as an industry leader, quickly gaining share in the market. We're seeing our efforts to extend ShareFile to the enterprise segment pay big dividends, with the highest number of large deals ever.","Among those large scale wins with ShareFile, we saw one of the largest accounting firms standardize on ShareFile to enable secure collaboration and work flows between their consultants and clients. With accounting being a target vertical for ShareFile, this win now gives ShareFile two of the top four accounting firms as customers.","Our unique differentiators clearly help ShareFile to continue to stand out against generic cloud storage providers. In fact, last week, Citrix was positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quarter for Enterprise File Sync and Share for the third consecutive year. Needless to say, we see a very bright future for ShareFile.","This week marks my sixth month as Citrix's CEO, and I'm more enthusiastic than ever. Our results demonstrate that we're on the right path, building new Citrix. I feel highly confident that we have the right strategy and the plan to execute upon it. I'm incredibly excited about the future of Citrix. Today's announcement with LogMeIn will allow us to continue to focus our resources and investments and accelerate our execution and results.","Thank you, and we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operation Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One, just a quick one for David on \u2013 maintenance revenue was down sequentially. We haven't seen that before. What was the driver there?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Walt. Two things. One is the decrease is a direct result of just declining Workspace Services' license you've seen a couple of years back. Fortunately, the pressure there is abating as the performance has really come back on that front.","I'd say that, as we've talked about a couple of times, we're uplifting the ARR by delivering new offerings and really migrating customers towards higher-value subscriptions, and so as of last quarter, we had about 25% of the installed base migrated. We're going to be making a larger portion the second half of the year, really accelerating that, so I think that's one of the things that's going to continue to drive license update and maintenance going forward.","I'd say the second thing is a little bit of a timing issue with our largest installed base customer for an order that came in right after the close of the quarter, which influenced that to kind of a mid-single digit millions range. Overall, when I look at license update and maintenance, I'm comfortable with about 3% growth for the year and expect that to grow sequentially into Q3.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then, Kirill, on the GetGo transaction, you're contributing about two-thirds of the revenue to that business, and you're taking about half the economic value there in terms of the shares after the deal. And I'm wondering just sort of how you thought about that? It seems like a bit favored in your direction on the revenue contribution but more of an even split on the economics?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, if you think about this deal, first and foremost, this transaction is about synergies than it is about scale. Essentially we're creating a new company which is at scale, at much larger scale compared to both LogMeIn and GetGo if we were to spin it off into the independent company, and most importantly it is the speed of our execution and certainty for Citrix.","I think those three things combined, in particular the Synergy side which realizes tremendous value for the both LogMeIn and Citrix, is a tremendous asset here. We have larger revenue. LogMeIn is a faster-growing company. In balance, we feel good about the distribution of value in this transaction.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","This is Nikolay Beliov sitting in for Kash. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us a little bit more detail around the Microsoft relationship, especially the go-to-market component of it?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, obviously, as you all know, we've announced this much stronger relationship at the end of May, along with our Synergy conference. We're now putting it to work. There's a tremendous collaboration that we're starting to see in the field worldwide. I just returned from touring EMEA, and every stop of the way there is a lot of energy and a lot of discussion between Microsoft and Citrix field organizations. We've seen some real examples where collaboration is already occurring.","LG Uplus in Korea was one such example and there are many more, and I will expect to see a lot more. This is clearly the case where this is win-win for both companies. Citrix is truly helping Microsoft deploy Skype for Business in virtualized setting in the largest enterprises, and that's how they want to deploy Skype for Business. This is also the case where Citrix has a ready-to-go technology to help deploy Windows 10 in the enterprise, and obviously Microsoft is very focused on that deployment.","And all of that is even before we realize some additional product integrations that are coming later in the next 12 months and enterprise mobility suite and NetScaler with Azure and more on Azure integration. So all in all, this is really what we're seeing as the beginning of this partnership becoming to work for both companies.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And can you please provide us an update with how the channel performed in the quarter?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Nikolay, it's David. I'd say channel continues to perform well. We have been working on that over the course of the last few quarters. You're seeing a higher contribution, kind of the way we measure internally around net new source versus performance and so it's trending in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...my questions, and congratulations on that deal. It seems exciting. Two questions, if I look at your growth in Workspace, it's good, it's getting better but it's still a very measured growth rate, and I look at the friends from the ember (22:31) and there you'll see numbers don't look overly pretty at the moment, and let's not talk about mobile and (22:36) for the time being. Is there a change in how the value gets distributed in the industry at the moment or is Microsoft taking a bigger share? Or like something, any \u2013 all of the old big guys seem to be suffering at the moment and it seems something bigger is going on? Maybe I'm missing something here but maybe, Kirill, maybe give me your view of how you think about this?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think in the \u2013 when you take the geography where our execution is really going incredibly well, which is Americas we clearly see winning, we clearly see Citrix taking share and we clearly see Citrix regaining strength. And I think our execution in North America and our growth in virtual computing and end user computing as a whole in North America is just an example of what's possible when the execution gets nailed across the world, which, of course, is something that we're focused on, on working on, and that we'll see in the coming quarters. But certainly the tides have shifted in the last quarter. That's how we want to see it.","I think our teams worldwide are getting very focused on regaining market share and getting to winning spirit. That's been pretty significant shift that we saw, as it is evidenced by just sheer volume of wins that we've seen around the world, but most importantly in North America. And, of course, as I mentioned earlier, our partnership with Microsoft is starting to provide significant uplift, and we believe that it will continue to provide that uplift going forward.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Raimo, it's David. Let me put a few numbers around that as well, just to reinforce a couple of these points. First off, as Kirill mentioned, Americas did extremely well. In fact, for Workspace Services new licenses they posted over 20% growth year-on-year. When I look at our subscription delivered CSB business, that's growing north of 35% year-on-year. Our other SaaS delivered options while small, things like XenMobile cloud and others, are growing over 25% a year. So we're certainly seeing user growth faster than actual reported revenue growth, but that's okay. And you know, because those will catch up over a lifetime value. So we feel like the work that we've done over the course of the last year, the innovation, the integration and simplification is really working in our favor, and we'll just keep executing.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Very clear. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Nicole Hayashi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. This is Nicole in for Heather. I might have missed this but could you talk about the percent of delivery network revenue that came from public cloud vendors? And since this business is typically lumpy quarter-to-quarter, how do you expect this business to play out in the second half, especially given difficult comps starting next quarter?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Nicole, this is David. I did say that about 50% of the contribution in the quarter from NetScaler is coming from cloud infrastructure and cloud service providers. I mean, it continues to be obviously a meta-trend across the industry and so, not only are we contributing to the build out of public cloud infrastructure which has been a tremendous strength over the last four quarters, but we're seeing a growing number of customers that are actually delivering their own cloud services, and so that's part of expanding the base at the same time.","It has been a little bit more of a lumpy segment historically. However, we're now on the fourth quarter of strength in this business, so we've had great continuity over the course of the last year. It's one of the things that always allows us to be conservative when we look forward, because it is such a large concentration, but we love our position there and even when I look at the other parts of NetScaler like the enterprise ADC market, et cetera, we've talked about being capacity constrained in the past. One of the investments we're making right now is to expand our go-to-market capacity across, really across all geos, and that's one of the things that will allow us to even accelerate that business going forward.","Nicole Hayashi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks very much and congrats on the transaction and the good quarter. Hey, David, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just margin expansion from here in the core business. It's obviously been an unbelievable move over the last year, but I imagine some of the low-hanging fruit has been sort of pruned at this point in time, and what drives margin expansion from here.","And then just secondly and somewhat related, when are we going to get a bit of a clearer view of the core business, margins and earnings contribution, say ex the go-to business? Is that something that's just going to have to wait until after the transaction is completed, or I guess how are you thinking about that? Thanks.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Kirk. Let me start at the top actually and just talk about op margins. So in \u2013 six months ago when we laid out targets for the combined company, we were talking about 30% op margin by the end of 2017. I mean, we're clearly operating well ahead of that, probably a \u2013 nearly a full year in front of that when you look at our guidance, so we're really happy with the execution across the board. When you kind of step back a little bit and think about the core Citrix, excluding the part that is merging with LogMeIn, that part of the business is operating between 1.5% and 2% higher on an adjusted op margin than the consolidated whole. So we're clearly well above the 30% range already from a core Citrix point of view.","As it comes to providing more granularity into the individual pieces, the S-4 will be filed by LogMeIn later this quarter, and so at that point in time you'll have a better position to look at the individual performance of the go-to business standalone, the forecast moving forward, et cetera, and I'd say after Q3 we'll be talking about guidance going forward for 2017 as a standalone entity. So I'd say that \u2013 that's a better way to think about it.","Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I'd actually just like to talk about the international business, maybe specifically EMEA. Kirill, you mentioned you were just over there. You mentioned that you've kind of just begun following the roadmap that the U.S. has provided. But I wondered if we could just drill down and get a little bit more color on what kind of changes we might see in EMEA, what kind of timing we're talking about. Could you give us a little bit more color around that? Thanks.","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think we've certainly seen tremendous progress in the Americas since we started the restructuring and implemented some very important changes in this region, earlier than we did it in EMEA and in Asia Pacific and Japan. Essentially we're following the same blueprint that is working so successfully for us in the Americas and in EMEA right now, this was the sort of main purpose of deep dive with the team in EMEA, we had the entire leadership put two days and we went through strategy across different countries, across different regions, and we really see some positive momentum and we see great opportunities.","In fact, we've spotted some strong opportunities in the U.K. and we're working to realize them, and we expect to see those materialize, I would say, within the next 12 months. Similarly, in France, and we have strong leadership and strong execution in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe in place already. So we look forward to seeing greater results in that region.","Overall, as I mentioned in my remarks, we see great opportunities there, obviously balancing it with the obvious geopolitical headwinds, but we think that in the next 12 months we'll see strong results in EMEA following what we're seeing here in Americas already.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. And just a quick follow-up on the NetScaler business. I was going to ask about service provider. I think, one of the things you were trying to do is reduce the reliance on large transactions with maybe some of the customer concentration you have, trying to build out more of a run rate business. Have you been able to do that? Is some of the strength we've seen here coming on base hits in doing some of that smaller business? Thanks.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I'd say, overall, when looking at NetScaler, we sold to 1,900 unique customers in the period, about a third of those being net new to Citrix. So a big push for us going forward is, of course, continuing to expand the base.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I just wanted to drill down on one of the positive metrics here, that 23% license growth in the Americas for the Workspace business. You broadly said it was due to good execution, but could you offer a little bit more clarity on how you're driving that growth? And whether pricing is a lever that you're using any more aggressively? Thank you.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, this is David. I'd say pricing is not a lever we're using aggressively. In fact, pricing is one of those things that you're competing against. In many cases, we are not the low-cost provider. In fact, we are \u2013 you're often competing against a bundled solution, and so price is not a lever that generates growth generally.","We compete on breadth of functionality. We compete on integration and unique assets. And so, that's really been the big driver. When you look across the Americas business, they had great performance from everything from fin services to healthcare to technology companies and others, and it's just a testament to the execution of that team and a lot of the work that they've done. So I'd say our win rates and everything in the US are extremely high, and we're just going to continue driving forward as quickly as we can.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Turits. Raimo asked about the Desktop business, but how about on the XenMobile side? Both what do you see as the general market dynamics there, do you still see this as a growth business with opportunity for penetration and pricing? And what are you seeing competitively against AirWatch, MobileIron and Microsoft?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we actually see XenMobile continue to perform well as part of the overall Workspace suite and end user computing push from Citrix. As I mentioned, we've received another strong accolade from Gartner, being named as a leader in their Magic Quadrant, and the product has done very well. We have some unique differentiators that continue to play out for us, in particular, we differentiate by delivering a unique set of capabilities in mobile application management as opposed to just generic low-cost mobile device management, and these are the capabilities that are being valued in bring-your-own-device scenarios. These are capabilities that are actually being valued by Microsoft. They were core to our alignment with Microsoft, between XenMobile and Enterprise Mobility suite, and we see continued strength and growth in that market. Yet again, we differentiate by focusing on mobile application management, by delivering unique capabilities like Micro VPN, and really focusing on a suite with XenMobile, with ShareFile, and with NetScaler playing a significant role in that particular rollout.","And we also continue to strengthen our portfolio and our solution with some additional capabilities like the new forms application that was introduced as part of XenMobile in June. It's being very well received by our customers, yet again focusing on applications versus device itself.","So we're quite excited about what we have with XenMobile. We predominantly see it as a part of the overall suite, of the overall offering. We see more and more customers choosing XenMobile to be delivered as a Cloud service, and we expect to see more of that. And we're quite excited and bullish about that particular product.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","It sounds really strong in terms of capabilities. You did mention on EUC that \u2013 or Desktop that it felt like you were regaining share there. Does it feel the same way on XenMobile, or is it hard to tell because it's part of the bundle?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We really view it as a part of the overall solution, and as David mentioned, we see significant growth, continuous growth in customers wanting to buy the overall suite and kind of the overall Citrix value as opposed to point products. And I think, even if you look at some of our competitors, we're ahead of many in sort of being able to provide this complete value, raising our standing in the enterprise IT to the level of sort of enterprise decision-maker versus a point product implementer, and we actually view it as a very positive sign.","We first sort of saw it at Synergy, when, for the first time ever, we had this good contingent of IT decision-makers, really senior CIO level people coming to join us to talk about Citrix, and that raised profile and raised visibility certainly enable to us deliver more of that complete value. And that's certainly how we'll look at the future. It's not a point product, it's a overall end-to-end solution to help people securely deliver their apps and data.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Kirill.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities.","Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you. Kirill, thanks for that additional color. That was very helpful. Now how should we think about the potential for Workspace's business in light of your partnership with Microsoft? What type of revenue growth can the segment deliver on a sustainable basis, and how far are we from getting there?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think our partnership with Microsoft is starting to produce real results, and in this past quarter already, even though we announced this partnership with Microsoft actually midway in the quarter, even in that quarter, we saw some very exciting wins as a result of better alignment.","We see more of that alignment coming in the future. I would say right now, we're at the beginning of working out the mechanics and specifics of how this partnership is going to play out in the field. The signs, the early signs are incredibly positive, and we're certainly looking forward to increased velocity and better execution, and frankly, better momentum as we work close together.","There's some specific product initiatives and specific joint workings in the field that will certainly be producing more results. We're ready to go with Skype for Business virtualized, and that's how many a large enterprises want to deploy Skype for Business on Citrix. Microsoft just issued technical guidance on essentially stating that Citrix is clear choice to deploy Skype for Business this way. We have solution to deploy Windows 10 in the enterprise and virtualized and VDI fashion, and that is incredibly well received, and that is a huge priority for Microsoft.","And we certainly expect both of those existing initiatives to start bearing more fruit. Of course, it depends on overall Skype for Business adoption in the enterprise. It all depends on Windows 10 adoption in the enterprise, and we continue to work with Microsoft to advance it.","And of course, later in this year, we're really looking forward to introducing additional capabilities into this partnership and into this channel, especially with XenMobile and overall XenMobile suite now playing a role into the Enterprise Mobility suite and also NetScaler being aligned with Azure.","Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And, David, looks like OpEx was a little bit more than initially expected, resulting in lesser EPS beat was with the revenue performance. Can you talk about the OpEx during the quarter, what drove it higher and how should it trend over the next few quarters? That's it for me.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Abhey. I'd say that a few one-time costs and in Q2, especially in the G&A line, you saw that jump pretty heavily on a sequential basis. That will come back down in Q3. I would expect, actually, overall OpEx to decline from Q2 to Q3 at this point in time. There's also, you know, a fair bit of variable comp in there as we've outperformed in the first half of the year. Really nothing besides that.","Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you guys for taking the question. Perhaps a little bit of a \u2013 sort of a longer-term question. It seemed like coming out the Analyst Day, the focus was definitely on rolling out further cloud services with the expectation that maybe we'll see some of those on additional products in the back half of this year. So I guess the question is, are we on track for the cloud service roll outs? Is there anything kind of in the guide for those? And how should we think about that impacting results in 2017? Maybe even just from a kind of a mix shift and how revenue is recognized perspective?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Keith. This is David. Let me take the guidance part of that question. Overall, I wouldn't say there's anything explicit in our guidance. However, implicitly, we are certainly talking about a model shift that we've seen gradually. For us, we're in a fortunate position where a lot of it is incremental to what we've already done. The CSP, for example, which is ratable coming out of the Workspace Services business is addressing SMBs and other areas that our core products wouldn't have.","That business is running about a $75 million ARR right now. When I look back at core Citrix cloud delivered services, ShareFile is clearly the biggest. But we've also rolled out new services around XenMobile. We delivered networking, actually, as a service. We have desktop and VDI and some of these other things that are rolling out as new services. When you aggregate those together, that business is running at about a 30% clip, and it's generating an ARR of roughly $130 million per year.","So I mean you put those two together, and we are sitting on over $200 million of annualized recurring revenue growing north of 30% right now. That's probably the best way to really frame out the shift that we've seen over the past couple of years, versus a type of revenue model that you would have had historically. It will be a shift that continues. You know, we're going to talk about this metric each and every quarter to give people more visibility into how that is moving. And when the time comes, not in fiscal year 2016, but when the time comes then we're going to be more aggressive in our shift of installed base, or something that could have a material impact, we'll make sure we talk about that well in advance and communicate that explicitly as a part of guidance.","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and I would just add that Citrix cloud is, overall, obviously, very significant transformative momentum that is building inside Citrix. We signaled the fact that we are all in, in the cloud at the Synergy event in May. We are working hard to solidify our road maps, and continue to deliver new services. We have some additional milestones later in this year and most importantly, in January of 2017 at our kick off with our partner community where we're going to be articulating more detailed strategy, and more detailed deliverables. But before this calendar year ends, we will have some very significant things to articulate to the channel, and to the market in terms of our wins, in terms of the referenced customers that are going onto Citrix cloud end-to-end and continuous alignment with Microsoft on the overall cloud delivery.","So it's, I would say, from where we were early in the year, we've made huge progress. From what we announced at Synergy, we feel good at where we are on the delivery, and I would say overall we're on track with this Cloud transformation. And, of course, as David mentioned, once we have specifics and details on the pace and updated guidance, we will certainly bring it up to you.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. And then maybe just one more very tactical question. You talked about some uneven macro out there. Any explicit impacts you saw either on Q2 results? Or sort of how you're thinking about close rates in the pipeline coming specifically from Brexit?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, obviously there's some uncertainty that comes from any event like that, and just like anyone else in business and anyone else in our industry, would see some modest impact of Brexit, but I wouldn't characterize it as material. And for us, most importantly is to bring our execution in EMEA to the level of Americas, and I think that is the most important priority of ours, and that's what we're focused on in EMEA right now.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is the from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.","Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.","Thank you for taking my question. David, back to I think where we started with Walter a little bit on the license updates and maintenance. Help us with some of the puts and takes here. You mentioned that you didn't get a renewal in the quarter which would have made things look better. But what do renewal rates look like overall? And then with regard to moving into CSP Workspace Services in the cloud. Help us with some of the puts and takes there, because you didn't really show a big improvement in sequential deferred revenue despite the fact that your license revenue was up even for workspace?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, let me take the license update piece first. Yes. On a year-on-year basis, it was up about 3%. There was our single largest customer renewal that happens on an annual basis. It just slipped a little bit and because of that some chunk of revenue got deferred out of the quarter. That will come back in Q3. I'd say that's the only one real anomaly that's out there. The other two dynamics that I talked about earlier are important to understand in terms of net new licenses and Workspace Services and then the underlying ARR of each individual customer contract below that and that's the work we're doing that to capture that multi-hundred-million-dollar opportunity by migrating everyone to maintenance offerings. So I think that's kind of the dynamic in there. I think for the full year, I would expect that license update and maintenance line to be growing roughly 3% all in. The...","Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.","Okay. And then \u2013 go ahead.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","No. Go ahead. Ask your question.","Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.","I was going to say then secondarily with regard to Europe shifting gears, you mentioned that you laid the groundwork there. What evidence do you have in terms of improvement? Is there improved bookings rates? When would you expect this to turn a corner? Because it was down obviously year-over-year but also down sequentially. And then APAC has been down for quite a while so when can we expect some improvement on that front?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I would say Europe is obviously an aggregation, in a number of unique markets. I mean obviously our largest being the UK and that's been the most challenged from an execution point of view. If we step back and we exclude UK, it's masking real solid growth across a number of other regions in EMEA. So that's clearly our focus in terms of making that better. Same thing holds true for our Japan business. It's one of those areas that's been somewhat challenged and we're in the process of working on execution there. And what we've seen in the US, I mean, the pattern works. We're having really good results there. We're just \u2013 we need to drive it around the rest of the world.","Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.","So how soon should that pattern work? What's expected timing for return?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're working it right now. And hopefully you see results and let's think EMEA in the second half of the year and that will be focused on the UK. We'll probably talk a little bit more about it just because it is such a big market and it's been one that's has been underperforming for us over the course of the first half of the year.","Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. On Workspaces, can you just talk a little bit about the low single digit organic growth, what you think you need to change to get that high single digit organic growth?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we just have to keep executing. I mean, it's been a trend that's been up and to the right for a number of quarters now. We are seeing more growth in users than we are in actual revenue. Some of that is just a shift in the overall model towards term license, towards CSP, towards other things. Users have been growing in the mid-single digits for a couple of quarters now. I think that's a reflection of the work that we've done and we're going to keep at that. A number of things that Kirill talked about that we're doing from new cloud services, work with Microsoft, et cetera, you know, more to come on that front. I think at this point it's really just execution and we're going to continue the pattern that we've been on.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","And, David, just with the mid-single digit user growth, what's the discrepancy? Is it just you're just giving lower prices per user? What's happening there and how does that \u2013 does that wear off over time?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","It's a different type of user. CSP, for example, it's one that we've talked about now for a couple of times. Those are monthly subscriptions where our CSP partners are leveraging XenApp to deliver a cloud service. We build those on a monthly arrears basis. That business is growing at about 35%, generates a much higher user count. If you think about that in ARR terms which is again, it's an important metric that we're going to have to be talking more about, that business runs with an ARR of about $75 million a year right now which is a material part of overall Workspace Service license. If I look at just other SaaS inside of that, the smaller services, those are obviously growing faster than the whole. So that's the primary disconnect you see between users and recognized revenue.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. David, just a clarification on something you just said. I guess, well first of all, how long did it take for that 25% of Workspace installed base to transition to ARR? And when you say product license revenue grew 1% year-over-year for this business, does that include the subscription transition to ARR? Because subscription, as I think you just said, is in the product license line, isn't it?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","In the case of CSPs, yes, it's in the product license line.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","In the case of any cloud-delivered service, that shows up on the SaaS line.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Okay.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","In terms of the installed base, we've got about 25% migrated. We have new products being delivered with, I guess you could think of it as a holistic maintenance offering instead of a standalone subscription advantage contract. The difference from a customer point of view, just so you can model this out is, think roughly 5 percentage points of revenue is the difference in pricing between one contract and the other.","We're doing some things right now that will accelerate the installed base migration over the latter part of this year and into next year. At our analyst day we identified a couple hundred million dollar plus opportunity just within this installed base and that's one of the areas that we'll be driving over the next few quarters, and you'll start to see that in results early next year.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And if I could ask a follow up. NetScaler business for the fourth quarter in a row has shown real strong growth. I know you've been hesitant to call it this, but it's starting to really look like a secular trend, I mean, like a more consistent secular trend. It's always been a driver, but it's always been really lumpy. But it seems like, I mean, should we \u2013 could we anticipate this being just a pretty consistent driver going forward, because it has been for now several quarters?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","John, I think that overall we have continued to outgrow the market for a number of years now. The part of the business that is associated with build out of public cloud and cloud services is the part that has been really outperforming over the last four quarters, and it's the area that we want to continue to be cautious about because it does have a higher concentration than the other many thousands of customers. And so we'll continue to be conservative on our outlook. But as you would imagine, we're doing everything we can to make sure that it is a repeating item. We just want to be very clear with everyone that it is more volatile and it does go up and down, we've just been really fortunate to see four quarters in a row of great performance.","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think it is certainly worth noting that secular trends are playing to NetScaler's continuous growth. Obviously cloud build-out only continues. It is hard to predict, but it's certainly been continuing for the last four quarters. Whether it's going to continue at the same pace, I tend to believe that it will but it's impossible to pin it down, and therefore we're being conservative on that part of the business. But then there are additional parts of NetScaler that we're really excited about. The fact that NetScaler is essentially the only pure software-defined ADC enables us to do truly unique things in that market, as evidenced by some wins last quarter, and of course emerging SD-WAN, part of NetScaler, we believe in very strongly, and we expect that to start providing some real material growth in 2017 as that market evolves and matures, and we certainly plan on talking about it when we provide overall guidance for 2017 in late October.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","And, Kirill, what areas or what use cases does the advantage of having pure software solutions sort of rise to the top?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's just flexibility in how you deploy it. It's ability to deploy NetScaler as a Docker container, essentially enabling sort of more on a kind of left-to-right load balancing in the DevOps scenario, its ability to deploy this technology in a traditional appliance, its ability to did deploy this technology as a virtual machine or in the cloud, and its ability to move from one to another, and its ability to scale up or scale down depending on the need.","It's also the ability to innovate at a rapid pace where essentially you don't need to replace your hardware in order to move up to new capabilities or increase your capacity, you just sort of enable new software features to deliver it and to unlock it. Those are sort of top obvious benefits, and of course it's not to mention the pace of execution being more agile and really embracing new requirements much faster by delivering it in a software fashion.","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah, I was wondering if you could just discuss what you see as really core business use case drivers for the \u2013 really for the year-over-year rebound in the US, particularly around Workspaces and XenApp? Is there some pent up demand in the market? Or more specifically, when you look at the CSP model, are you having customers making a transition of their existing licenses into an expansion through CSPs?","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think \u2013 let's just start with Citrix's strategy. We're all about secure delivery of apps and data, and this is the top-of-mind of every organization large and small, security and cyber-security playing such a strong \u2013 it's such a strong priority for everybody. And I would say that is the number one most significant secular trend that drives the need for Citrix solutions. And of course, Windows 10, Skype for Business that we've already discussed, are additional very important capabilities that people need to embrace. And people need to deploy Skype for Business at scale. With Citrix you can do it securely, and you can do it reducing your overall support costs.","And sort of the other thing that I would mention is, with the engineering work that Citrix has been doing over the last few years, we're now uniquely positioned to deliver XenApp and XenDesktop, essentially application virtualization and desktop virtualization on the same platform.","And we're seen quite a strong number of customers really wanting to do both of the same platform, and some of those who were using XenApp in the past now want to deploy VDI. And having the same platform and the same infrastructure really enables them to do it with ease, using the same tools, using the same life cycle manager, management. That's the trend.","And perhaps the final thing that I would mention that sort of sets the Americas apart from the rest of the geos, here in Americas, the team embraced vertical focus ahead of anyone else. And if you think about healthcare wins, lots of them happened here in Americas, and if you think about financial sector and focus there, lots of those \u2013 most of those wins, actually \u2013 happens in Americas as well. And yet again, we expect the play book to now be replicated across the world, and that gives us confidence in the future.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. And just a follow-up for Dave. Given that the expected separation of the GetGo business is going to be a quarter later, has there been any change to your thinking about uses of cash and how you look at the balance sheet?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","No, there really hasn't, Ed. At this point, it's something that we've pushed out just with this transaction ongoing. Later in this year, we'll come back, we'll talk more about capital strategy and whatnot, but I think the anticipation is we've been very aggressive with share repurchase over the last several years. It's been our primary use of cash flow and will likely continue to be going forward.","Ed Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Zeller with Needham & Company.","Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. I'm not sure if it was mentioned earlier, but what was the performance of XenApp year-over-year? And what was the license performance year-over-year? Total rents and license?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Scott. We talked about Workplace Services, that business was up about 1% in net new licenses and 2% overall, including maintenance and subscription.","Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. So no break out of XenApp specifically?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","No. We didn't break out the individual components.","Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Ader with Blair.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. I just wanted to understand the license guidance, or the second half guidance, the implied product and license. Looks like it's going to be down year-over-year at a reasonable clip. Is that just a function of tough comps with last year?","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Jason. The \u2013 yes, the guidance is reflective of really good second half last year. But I wouldn't read into it at this point in time. The way to think about it is we're not guiding onto any individual line items. We're just guiding to total revenue and EPS, and in that respect, we uplifted expectations for both Q2 and for the full year well in excess of the Q2 beat. So we feel good about the business overall. We obviously just want to maintain a conservatism that we've had for a number of quarters now, and we'll do that for the balance of the year.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","David James Henshall - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer","You bet.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Zach Smith [RBC Capital Markets].","Zach Smith - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question. Are you currently exploring the app refactoring space? I know that hopTo \u2013 was that Synergy, was working on a XenApp integration. Is that still in process? It seems like their capabilities could be pretty beneficial for \u2013 well, especially legacy apps accessing those on mobile. All right. Thank you.","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, within XenMobile, we have broad-range capabilities that enable customers to essentially take their legacy apps and deliver them through newer technologies. There are also some very interesting things that are sort of, being currently in the pilot mode, coming out of our labs that would take legacy Microsoft Access applications and put them out on HTML 5-enabled devices which essentially, if you think about it, tens of millions of those Microsoft Access applications that are out there hidden in the coffers of large enterprises being essentially locked from being able to access from those modern devices. Now, that value that's quite important for those customers is being unlocked through that technology.","So there's a number of initiatives at play here, and I would say, sort of our overall approach of helping customers breach their past into the future, but most importantly being focused on the future and focused on the cloud is what we're going to continue to execute, and there's a broad range of things sort of coming from both angles here.","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue.","Kirill Tatarinov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today and thank you for following Citrix as we continue on our journey, making Citrix better than ever. I truly believe that we're on the right path, with an exciting product roadmap and a strategy that is being validated every day by our results. Thanks, everybody.

My name is Catena, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Citrix Systems' Q4 Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Fleites, you may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites","Thank you, Catena. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be David Henshall, acting Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Sudhakar Ramakrishna, Senior Vice President and GM of Desktop and Globalization.","This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems' Investor Relations website. The webcast replay will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specifications and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainty. Obviously, these risks can cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.","Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on the company's Investor Relations website. Furthermore, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I would like to turn it over to David Henshall, our acting CEO and Chief Financial Officer. David?","David James Henshall","Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. While we ended 2013 with record aggregate results, this is a year of transition for the company. Entering the year, we initiated a strong pivot towards mobile, recognizing that customers were looking for better ways to embrace mobility, the cloud, IT consumerization and BYOD.","For years, we've been focused on connecting people to apps and information from any location over any device, simplifying IT and driving down costs. Today, we're a leading provider of infrastructure and cloud services, helping customers to deliver secure, managed mobile workspaces, mobilizing apps, data and people and helping them a true -- achieve true business value and productivity by embracing mobile workstyles.","At the same time, we're driving innovation in the data center with our unique technology across physical and virtual networking platforms, powering some of the world's largest clouds and giving enterprises the capabilities to combine best-in-class app networking services in a single consolidated footprint. I'm extremely proud of the Citrix team and our partners, whose hard work and perseverance have been critical as we continue to pivot to mobile and cloud.","So let's review the specifics from the fourth quarter. As you can see from the release, total revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $802 million. Product license revenue was flat year-on-year, which I'll discuss later in a little bit more detail. Deferred revenue grew to $1.4 billion, up $142 million sequentially and 18% year-on-year. And adjusted EPS was $1.04, an increase of 16%. In Q4, we closed 82 transactions greater than $1 million each, a nearly 50% increase over the 55 large deals from last year and importantly, 20 of these transactions came from the Networking and Cloud business.","Geographically, we saw uneven results across our markets in Q4. From a license revenue perspective, the EMEA region had a solid close to what had been a very challenging year, growing license 12% year-on-year and driving $38 million plus transactions. In the Americas, there were 35 large transactions but license revenue was only up 3%. And finally, in the Pacific Japan region, license declined 27% despite a record $9 million plus deals. But contributing to the year-over-year decline in this region was that most of these large contracts were from multiyear arrangements that are going to be recognized as revenue over an extended period of time.","So next, let's look at the Q4 results in our 3 primary businesses. First, our Mobile and Desktop business grew 4% from last year to $428 million, including an 8% decrease in license revenue. The Mobile and Desktop business continues to be in transition as we've been driving a broader conversation with customers about transforming their business to enable mobile workstyles. The latest release of XenMobile in Q4 has provided and really proven to be a catalyst for these conversations, allowing improved pipeline closure, more than 150% sequential increase in license revenue and enabling us to exceed our 2013 goals. We continue to set the bar in the enterprise mobility market with MDM, mobile apps, virtual apps in desktops and data, all at an integrated secured solution.","In Q4, 80% of our mobile platform customers opted for this complete edition, demonstrating the value of our integrated enterprise mobility offering versus just MDM. In the aggregate, we continue to see significant XenMobile pipeline developing, and we're very pleased with our momentum going into 2014.","But as we mentioned on our Q3 earnings call, there's been a few issues that have been impacting overall results in the desktop and apps business. First, the pivot to mobile. It's impacted our midsized transactional business for standalone desktop opportunities. And to address this, we'll refocus on driving more project-specific items, highlighting key attributes that have made our app and desktop solutions market leaders, areas like data security, compliance, cost savings and secure access.","The second factor has been the major platform transition with XenDesktop 7 and now 7.5. This platform is a cloud-ready infrastructure for delivering Windows apps and desktops as a service from a single, easy-to-use console. By significantly reducing installation complexity, accelerating app migrations, streamlining ops management and reducing total cost of ownership, we believe there's a solid multiyear product cycle ahead as customers refresh their data center infrastructure and begin to leverage hybrid clouds. We'll drive this actively with enhanced migration tools, architectural guidance and services.","The third area has been the perception that XenApp was going away, as this product has been deemphasized in messaging and in go-to market. But based on feedback from customers and partners, we are relaunching XenApp this quarter with the next-gen 7.5 edition. This is built on the new FlexCast Management Architecture and provides -- or allows simple secure delivery of individual Windows apps to mobile devices with demonstrable ROI.","Additionally, with 7.5, IT can now burst and grow their virtual applications to the cloud in realtime with hybrid cloud provisioning and out-of-the-box support for CloudPlatform, Amazon Web Services and soon, Microsoft Azure. XenApp has been a key technology leveraged by our service provider partners, driving the cloud delivery of apps and desktops. In fact, this subscription business was up about 50% year-on-year in Q4.","So we're delivering a complete enterprise mobility solution, allowing customers to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility and to do it all with the integrated experience that only Citrix can provide.","So next, in our Networking and Cloud business, total revenue increased by 13% in the quarter with product license revenue also up 13%. The NetScaler products were again the major driver for this business, up more than 40% from last year with balanced growth between the enterprise customers and Internet and cloud providers.","So a little bit more context on the networking business. Let me touch on a few metrics from Q4. First, the cross-sell in desktop attach initiatives led to 800 virtualization orders that included NetScaler as part of the solution. This number is up about 20% from a year ago. Also, we transacted with over 2,500 different customers in the period compared with about 2,000 last year as we continue to expand the base.","From a mix perspective, the NetScaler SDX platform represented nearly 20% of NetScaler sales and increased over 45% year-on-year. And the investments we made in go-to market coverage, specifically in EMEA, continue to bear fruit, leading to more than 50% growth year-over-year in that geo. And finally, in our ByteMobile business showed good traction in Q4, signing multiyear contracts with large telcos in Japan, Pacific and EMEA. Although revenue for these contracts is going to be recognized over extended periods of time, we still beat our revenue goal for the year.","Within our SaaS businesses, revenue was up 13%. The collaboration services, like GoToMeeting, remain the primary driver, growing 18% year-on-year. Additionally, ShareFile, our data sharing platform, is continuing to scale up nicely, up 65% from last year and now approaching 10% of the overall mix in SaaS.","By integrating data into our emerging mobile solutions, we're also expanding the reach into enterprise accounts, giving them the option of leveraging ShareFile connectors in their own data centers or on cloud storage platforms like Microsoft Azure. Impacting overall growth in SaaS, however, have been declines in the remote access solutions as these are addressing very mature market segments.","So turning to operations. Adjusted op margin in the quarter was just over 30%. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 86%, down 129 basis points from a year ago as the mix of revenue reflects the higher growth in networking and SaaS. We expect this trend to continue through 2014, but level off in 2015.","During Q4, we added 200 people to Citrix as we continue to focus on expanding go-to-market reach and customer direct touch, primarily around networking. And additionally, we've been investing to expand our data sharing in mobile platforms teams. We do expect growth in headcount will be modest in 2014. And finally, the adjusted tax rate in the period was 20% due to the strength of the EMEA results relative to the U.S.","Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue ended the year at $1.41 billion, an increase of $142 million sequentially. And included in this is strong growth in long-term deferred, up 31% year-on-year due to the number of large multiyear contracts. Cash and investments ended December at $1.6 billion. And as we indicated last quarter, we increased our repurchase program in Q4, buying back 4.4 million shares of stock and bringing the year-to-date total to over 7 million shares. Offsetting this investment was $230 million in cash flow from ops, bringing the full year total to over $930 million, up about 13% year-on-year.","So turning to our current outlook and expectations for 2014. I'd like to first provide some additional context around our guidance. So first, while we expect to see continued strong growth in networking, mobile platforms and our data sharing business, we're assuming uneven pipeline closure in desktop virtualization due to the factors that I discussed earlier.","Second, the strength in networking will likely compress gross margins by 1.5 to 2 percentage points from last year, ultimately impacting op margin. And finally, that the adjusted tax rate will increase from 20% to 24%, largely due to the federal R&D tax credit not having been extended yet by Congress. So if and when that happens, we would expect to see a lower tax rate. So we'll continue to focus on execution and delivering financial results by investing to expand our long-term capacity, innovation and competitive differentiation across our businesses.","So for fiscal year '14, our expectations are for total revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%, adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 84% to 85%, adjusted tax rate of 24% and adjusted EPS of $2.85 to $2.95 a share. And with respect to Q1, we expect total revenue to increase 8% to 10% from last year, adjusted gross margin in the range of 84% to 85% and adjusted EPS of between $0.57 and $0.60 a share.","And finally, as you saw on the release, Mark will be returning to Citrix at the beginning of February as full-time CEO, but with the intent of retiring within the next year.","So as we open up the call for questions, I want to let you know that I'm joined again today by Sudhakar Ramakrishna, SVP and General Manager of our Enterprise and Service Provider division, who is also available to address your questions.","So operator, we'll now open it up and take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","I can [ph] look at 2013, can you talk about the desktop and mobility business, the dynamics in that business? Was it -- was there anything on the competitive front or market front, or was it just getting the product ready? And also, it's interesting to see your emphasis on XenApp. So how quickly can you restart that business? And does that create any opportunity of disruption as you're engaging in customer conversations?","David James Henshall","Sure, Abhey. Let me take the first part of that question and ask Sudhakar to add color as well. We sat back and looked at the overall business. We talked about it over this call and over the last call that we initiated a broad pivot to mobile in the beginning of the year. And that was not without some level of distraction and both in terms of our go-to-market engine, our messaging, et cetera. And so we've been addressing those things over the last 6 months, let's say, focused on helping customers scale and manage the new platform, which once they get on it will allow them to go faster, driving down complexity and some of the issues that we've highlighted in the past. That's a big one. The tools and messaging and demand gen and those types of activities that we're focused on with our sales kickoffs that we just completed a couple of weeks ago, really helping get our teams reengaged on customers, the types of problems that we're addressing, the needs that they have and connecting solution with budget much more directly. And then XenMobile is really starting to ramp, and we've completed building out our mobile team. And so the core teams can really go back and refocus on apps and desktops. With respect to XenApp, I mean, it's been a great technology for many years. It's truly fundamental and one that only Citrix can provide. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've had really just an overwhelming requests from partners and customers to reassert that technology and demonstrate the road map that we're delivering. And so we're really excited to bring forth 7.5. It's not a brand-new solution because customers already understand the value prop. There's certainly a lot of new features and value add that we're bringing in this new release, and we're all excited about it. I think that it may be a back half story for 2014, but we're bringing it to market later this quarter and we'll go from there. Sudhakar, would you like to add about that?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Things, David. First of all, I want to highlight on that XenApp, as we are releasing from a conceptual standpoint is not new. We have established our leadership in this segment, and the way I would characterize our effort right now is continuing to innovate, continuing to expand the possibilities. As you know, we released XenDesktop 7 last year and a follow-on release, and we've been unifying essentially our desktop and application delivery architectures and focusing a lot more on application delivery in the context of enabling users to be more mobile and also be able to leverage the cloud. So a lot of the work that we've done in XenApp centers around delivering superior experiences to end users for mobile applications, specifically Windows mobile devices. Extending the capabilities to support cloud has been an increasingly important request from our customers to support both from an enterprise premise into the cloud, and we support a variety of cloud form factors out there. Also, a key emphasis of what we have done with both our XenDesktop and XenApp is significantly reducing complexity, enhancing user experiences and delivering superior total cost of ownership. In fact, one data point I would give is that our information is about half -- takes half the step as our nearest competitor. And with some of the additions that we've made to our HDX platform, we significantly expand the experiences of end users from consuming Windows applications on mobile devices. This is part of an integrated strategy as it relates to enabling mobile workstyles and delivering mobile workspaces, of unifying mobile apps for Windows and native mobile apps through a common storefront and a common architecture. That tends to be our single biggest differentiator, and it seems to resonate very effectively to customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to dig in a little bit on your commentary about your expectations for desktop virtualization in '14. Obviously, you guys have commented that the release of XenDesktop 7 and because of the back-end infrastructure upgrades required, that, that may have paused or slowed down some incremental rollouts following that release. Are you -- how much of that are you sort of factoring into this '14 guidance? And then obviously, as you mentioned, XenDesktop 7 is an important release. But when do you think that starts to transition from sort of being headwind to rollouts as people upgrade the infrastructure to actually potentially become a tailwind at some point?","David James Henshall","Sure, Phil. It's David. Let me talk just a little bit about the financial side of it, and then Rama can talk specifically about what we're seeing in terms of XenApp 7 -- or XenDesktop 7 mix and what expectations are there. In the aggregate, we are very optimistic about the space long term. We haven't lost that conviction in any way. In fact, as you think about the way customers, IT organizations, are going to need to consume Windows applications over time, virtualization is one of the great ways to do it in a managed, simple, secure way and really transform them into a service so that they can be consumed and optimized alongside apps of all other types. And this is probably more pronounced over time. We really have the tools to address that. As we bring together mobile and mobile Windows apps, I think we'll have more and more unique capabilities to bring. As far as numbers and expectations, built into the guidance, of course, is just conservative assumptions around pipeline closure. Or while we're addressing all of the factors that I mentioned earlier, we want to maintain the right posture going into the year. And as these things start to take effect, then we'll come back and update it at that point in time. Rama?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Just to add to David's comments, the initial feedback has been extremely positive on a XenDesktop 7 and beyond releases. Common themes that we hear from customers is that it's incredibly simple as it relates to the deployment and operations as compared to anything out there in the marketplace. And there's an increasingly important significance being placed to our cloud capabilities, as well as the end user capabilities in mobile end markets. So the continued integration of our architecture and innovation around that is really what's driving the adoption and the traction. And as you know, in the past, the point against XenDesktop and XenApp or broadly speaking VDI and the virtualization industry was that it was complex, and we've essentially eliminated that barrier through internal innovations.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then David, I know you guys have an important release of XenMobile during Q4. Wonder if you could provide us just an update on that, and maybe if you could talk about sort of what feedback was from customers and also just maybe close rates kind of before and after the 8.6 release and how you think that actually affects business on '14.","David James Henshall","Yes, the 8.6 release was actually I believe the fifth release of that product family in the year. So we're on really rapid innovation cycles and obviously a call out to the team for what they're delivering. I think we addressed a lot of the major, call it, blockers that we had in place earlier in the year in terms of integration across the solution. And it is fairly challenging to bring together MDM plus the other capabilities, and it took the better part of the year. Fortunately, 8.6 knocked down a lot of those issues. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had more than 150% sequential ramp in product revenue between Q3 and Q4 and obviously closed as much business after the release of 8.6 as we did, frankly, in the first half of the year combined. So it's a great proof point. We're not done, we're continuing to innovate really rapidly, and I think it sets us up well for unique differentiated solutions going into '14. And the pipeline we've created and our outlook would certainly support that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Jonathan Parker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's actually Jon Parker calling in for Keith. I just wanted to dig in to the gross margin commentary a little bit. I think you sort of highlighted that most of it -- that the sort of degradation that we'll see next year is a result of the networking strength. But I also want to see how much of that is networking and how much might be coming from maybe competition on the mobile side. I guess, one of the things that we've heard quite frequently and people are wondering about are some of the pricing pressures that results to the enterprise mobility space. You guys obviously put out some interesting promotions over the last couple of days on the MDM front, but also on the enterprise front. And so I was wondering if you could talk about longer term how we should think about the margin structure at that part of the business and how that evolves competitively and if that has an impact on margins in the near term as well.","David James Henshall","Sure. Let me start at the top actually. When we think about gross margin, the single biggest impact is related to just the strength of networking. As you imagine, our networking products have gross margins in the mid- to high-70s, which is great for networking because we are software-based solution and we sell software license upgrades instead of simply new boxes. So that is where it is today, and it is improving. It's getting better all the time. So when we look at the aggregate mix of revenue across the company, it does start to plateau at about 84%. So I think that as we look into the end of next year and into '15, that's going to be a -- that will be a conversation that I think will be off the table looking forward and frankly, stop being a headwind to overall leverage and allow us to start driving more kind of gross operational leverage at that point. In terms of the pricing, the pure MDM space is incredibly competitive and it always has been. There's nothing new there. There are certain vendors that are very, very aggressive in kind of a land and expand or to be generous strategy, and so that impacts that. Of course, our strategy has been to drive a more holistic enterprise edition. I mentioned 80% of our revenue is coming from that, and that allows us to differentiate not get into the very price-sensitive segment. So our overall ASPs have been relatively stable throughout the year, except in the MDM-only area where they have been coming down.","Jonathan Parker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then also on mobility, I mean, clearly the sort of 150% sequential increase you alluded to is quite favorable. Did that help you to sort of hit that initial $30 million target that you're talking about for the year? And how should we think about the ramp in growth of that business heading into next year?","David James Henshall","Yes, it certainly did help us, allow us to exceed those goals. And we haven't broken out specific products into next year, but certainly believe that the ramp is very, very strong and it's certainly not out of expectation to double next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Sonya Banerjee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Sonya Banerjee on for Heather Bellini. I guess one more on NetScaler as well or even just the data center business. What impact did the Cisco relationship have in 2013? And how are you thinking about contribution in 2014 or even longer term?","David James Henshall","Well, it's a broad question. I mean, the Cisco relationship is very broad at this point in time. So when I talk specific dollars, the Cisco relationship is a contribution of us selling together; Cisco as an SI, as a partner in other dimensions, and that includes everything from networking to desktop virtualization to now mobility. I mean, we did over, I believe, over 15 transactions together with them for more than $1 million each last year. We have -- and that business is up well over 100%. We've got pipeline -- combined pipeline that's measured over $100 million for 2014. We have, I believe, more than 10 Cisco-validated designs right now for Citrix products. And then new initiatives like the Cisco (sic) [Citrix] NetScaler 1000V, which is an OEM product that Cisco is selling. That one went live in Q3. So we'll recognize revenue for that quarter in arrears. So there's no impact in '13, and that will be fairly modest but start to contribute in Q1 and moving forward. So there's a lot going on in the relationship. I think it's very positive right now. As we start looking into the, like, the 7000 platform and some of the more future 9000 platform, I think we've got some other interesting things to talk about throughout the year.","Sonya Banerjee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of organic business investment, what are the key areas of focus for 2014? I know that you said that headcount would be up modestly for the year. But when you're thinking about just growing the business and core areas in terms of sales in other areas, where are you investing?","David James Henshall","In sales, we're predominantly investing in networking coverage. Coverage is one of those that we are underserved in many markets, and EMEA is a great proof point where we made that investment in 2013 and you saw 50% growth in that business exiting the year. So I think we can still replicate that in many places. On the innovation front R&D, we'll invest in the mobile platforms team. We're investing in data sharing and a few other components of our SaaS business. Those are the largest areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Ken Wong for Walter. When we think about that 8% to 10% growth for '14, some of that is due to the shift to longer-term ratable contract. I mean, do you have a sense for what that 8% to 10% would've been if you guys were -- if you guys had contract terms that were consistent with the past?","David James Henshall","No, Ken, we're not really going to break that out at this point. I mean, the way to think about it is just at this point of the year, we're comfortable with 8% to 10% total revenue growth. The one area you should look at would be license updates and revenue. That's a line item that has decelerated over the course of the year, just reflecting lower growth in new licenses for app and desktop virtualization. So that's one that we're doing a couple of things beyond just, of course, growing new licenses. We've got strategic initiatives to drive what we call a more holistic software maintenance offering, which will allow us to uplift revenue per customer -- or recurring revenue per customer as much as 25%. We have a low attach rate right now. So that's one of the areas of focus in 2014, as well as just providing support, something that we haven't provided in the past, to customers. And these are areas that we'll be looking at from an ASP of that business standpoint. And then of course, as we layer in higher license sales over the course of this year, that will help turn that number around.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then I guess another question just around -- about spending, so right now you guys are waiting for the pipe to start close and hopefully that those start to convert. I mean, if you guys start to -- if you guys don't see the pipe closing any sooner in '14, I mean, should we expect that you guys could dial back spending a little bit to keep profitability where you guys have guided?","David James Henshall","I think right now we're focused on driving growth over the long term. I mentioned the areas that are producing strong growth: networking, data sharing, mobility, et cetera, and some of the areas that are, frankly, in transition, like desktop virtualization. So we're not looking to optimize for short term, but we're certainly aware of the overall profitability of the business. And if the environment or other factors don't contribute to growth, then we would address that in realtime.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Chaitanya Yaramada in for Steve Ashley. I wanted to ask on APAC. License was soft this quarter. Was that essentially a function of the macro environment in those regions, or are there opportunities to improve execution? And also, what are you assuming for APAC for 2014 guidance?","David James Henshall","I'd say within APAC, there were -- APAC and Japan as kind of combined region, there were 2 factors. One, most of the pressure came from emerging markets for various reasons. And then second, a lot of the large transactions, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, were multiyear in nature. So limited recognized revenue upfront, but they'll flow in over the course of the next 1, 2, 3 years. As far as what's included in our expectation, we really haven't broken out guidance necessarily by region, but we certainly have expectations around things that we need to do to improve execution in every market. I mean, that's true, not just one specific geo.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then for -- as a follow-up, you had mentioned last quarter that in the Networking and Cloud business, a number of large deals had slipped in the cloud provider sector. Did you have success closing those deals in the quarter and now there are more that remain in the pipeline?","David James Henshall","Sure. There's a lot in the pipeline, as there always is though. I mean, pipelines remain robust in that business. So we did close -- a couple of the deals had slipped. Those were more specifically in the what we call Internet and cloud service provider segment. That business did well, rebounded in growth rate. We actually had a nice balanced growth across both the what we call enterprise customers as well as more cloud-centric. So everything that we've talked about over the course of the year in that business, whether it's increased coverage or at the product, up leveling the -- from the technology and the way customers think about it to the SDX platform. They're all working really well right now, so we're very happy with the networking business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ed Maguire with Quest.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","CLSA. I wanted to turn the question towards service providers. You'd mentioned that you've seen some good momentum there. What are your plans for investment on the service provider side, in what areas specifically? And with the entry of Amazon and more competition in the desktop of the service market, could you comment on what the competitive environment is like and what your conversations may be focused on there?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Okay. Let me address it in 2 dimensions here. One is, broadly speaking, the communication service providers, the large telcos, the traditional service providers. We are seeing significant traction there, as David alluded to in the prepared comments, with regards to our ByteMobile product, as well as some early traction with NetScaler. And we've also been doing very well with our CloudPlatform in that segment. So it's a broad segment. It's early days from a Citrix investment standpoint, but our competitiveness as well as early indicators are very, very strong in the broader communication service provider segment. Looking ahead, we plan to leverage these capabilities, whether it be on ByteMobile, CloudPlatform or NetScaler to support service providers' needs as it relates to network function virtualization, but that's more of a future investment that we will be making. Specific to desktop as a service, in our case, we've been delivering a lot of applications as a service through XenApp. It's our Citrix service provider. So we don't have a native service of our own as much as the Citrix service provider partners have been accelerating our growth in that segment and we are seeing some very healthy, call it, growth rates. In terms of investments, we are building specific functionality for that particular segment because we believe in the opportunity and the size of that market. In fact, last quarter, I indicated that market itself will be about a $600 million plus market for us. And last but not least is we are also creating tools for the enterprise segment from the standpoint of with the most recent XenApp and XenDesktop release, we have included Cloud Burst capabilities. By that, what we mean is providing the enterprise ability to leverage the cloud for business continuity or build capacity needs. And therefore, by working with service providers on one hand and providing the capabilities to the enterprise on the other hand, we are providing them many more flexible options leveraging the cloud.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Three questions. First, David, just to -- can you talk me through again why that 84% is the plateau level for gross margins if the -- and so basically, are we assuming that the desktop mobile part of the business will take up revenue growth in '15 again and hence you don't have that mix effect -- negative mix effect? And then I have a quick follow-up.","David James Henshall","Yes, Raimo, in terms of 2014, it's just a function of networking as the fastest part -- fastest-growing part of the business right now. So that's pressuring gross margins. And even with a strong growth rate in '15, the: a, we're starting to reach down to the levels of where the aggregate gross margin is for our networking business, so you just have compression there; and then second, other solutions like the stuff Rama was just talking about, cloud service providers, the strength in mobile and other software-based solutions providing near 100% gross margins. So as those balance each other out, that's why it's approaching a plateau and also providing potential for growth in the future.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then the -- that really helps. And then on your desktop business, obviously like this quarter -- it seems like everyone kind of doesn't like you anymore. Like, we had the Amazon announcement. We had VMware trying to take some people off you. Can you just talk a little bit about your desktop business there, especially the people that you lost and how we kind of try to backfill that?","David James Henshall","Yes, let me address the people issue. Beginning in 2013, we had a specific focus on our R&D: increasing innovation, increasing product integrations. And to this end, we brought in highly-experienced, relevant leadership in both of our product divisions: Chris Hylen in SaaS and Sudhakar in the enterprise and service provider division. So as they've been building out their teams and looking for specific skill sets, I'd say it's not unexpected to see and expect, frankly, a turnover. However, it's not appropriate for us to talk about the specific circumstances surrounding the departure of any one individual. In terms of the overall business, I mean, Citrix is the market leader in app and desktop virtualization. I mean, we have the largest and broadest product portfolio. We have the largest account base. And when we look at the largest, most strategic customers in the world, they all, frankly, depend on XenDesktop or XenApp to virtualize their infrastructure. And so we're continuing to drive that. You see that with the strength of large transactions in the quarter. We had, by far and away, a record number of large deals this period, and that's where we've been focused.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","And David, I just want to add that we've also been incredibly successful at attracting very key talent into the organization throughout the year, both organic and inorganic. And I feel incredibly positive about the talent that we currently have to be able to execute on our mission and strategy compared to when we started 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","VMware has been talking about gaining share relative to you guys. I'm sure that you would like to think that you have a better shot at regaining your market share. Why would -- what are some good reasons to believe that you should be able to regain your market share in desktop virtualization in 2014? And secondly, with respect to the VDI business, David, hearing you over the past several years talk about the recurring nature of the business, would you be completely closed or would you be somewhat open to a business model transition towards reorganizing that business into more of a recurring subscription-oriented business asset? You have the vast majority of that business, and it's a little hard to live with the quarter-to-quarter volatility. And you notice companies like Adobe and Autodesk, which sell into relatively not the super high growth end markets, that have successfully managed to transition their businesses or at least seem to be working in that direction. It would occur to me that this is the one obvious lever that you have in your model. It simplifies the end customer purchasing. It increases the visibility for your revenue stream. And also -- sorry for the long list here, but it's Q4, so hopefully that's okay -- any leverage you contemplate in your business model by reducing operating expenses to be more closely aligned with the 8% to 10% growth rate? It would occur to me that you have significant margin leverage if you chose to exercise that.","David James Henshall","Sure, Kash. Let me parse out your 3 questions. In terms of -- let me start with the VDI question. Absolutely open to evolving the business model. In fact, we have been, as a company, actively driving towards more recurring revenue over the last many years, and we've done that through: our SaaS business where we now run north of $600 million SaaS business inside of Citrix; our recurring elements of desktop and app virtualization; the longer-term contracts; our CSP, which is our cloud service provider business, which is growing, as I mentioned earlier, 50% plus. And now in the aggregate, more than 2\/3 of our revenue was coming from recurring sources. So I like the model. And as we look at the app and desktop business, yes, we're open to that, but we want to do it in the right way. We want to do it in a way that isn't just changing the pricing mechanism but is delivering some element of continuing value to customers so that you can engage on a constant basis, so that you're focused on usage and you're focused on customer retention and expansion. We're working on that as we speak, so that it's not purely a perpetual sale always. In terms of your VMware question, I mean, it's hard for us to talk specifically about that. I mean, I don't think any other vendor besides Citrix really quantifies results in these areas. So we can't know in detail really what size of the base that anyone is coming off of when we talk about growth rates, how much is simple allocation of larger ELA, et cetera. So...","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","They said it's 13% or so of their billings and was up 30%. So there's some legitimacy to their claims. But I'm sure that you have a rebuttal, and I wanted to hear how you -- what your game plan is to restore the company back to the glory days of growth.","David James Henshall","Yes, we're not going to get into a rebuttal on an open conference call. But I can assure you that when we look at our product, the breadth of our product solution, the value that we're bringing to customers, the new platforms and unique capabilities like XenApp, I mean, we're going to be driving very hard right now. Rama talked about just the side-by-side comparison on complexity in all of the areas that we've addressed over the course of the last years. So happy to take head-to-head product comparisons any day, and we'll be focused going forward. Rama?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So a couple of additional comments here, Kash. One is to your point about business model shift. We are making a lot of product investments, be it in XenMobile, XenDesktop or XenApp, to allow us to deliver these services on a consumption model. So that investment train, so to speak, is already well underway, and we are preparing aggressively towards supporting that. And to the competitive question and the collective set, one key area of focus for us going forward will be enhanced focus on our channel as it relates to engaging with the channel, training them and becoming more competitive, so to speak, in the small, medium enterprise segment.","David James Henshall","Yes, and Kash, on your last question about op margin, we're investing in the areas that I talked about, areas that we're very happy to drive growth in the future, areas around networking and mobile, the long-term growth possibilities there. I think the majority of the operating compression that you're asking about is simply just the gross margin statement, and that's a reflection of the success we're having. We will be driving all of these areas that both Sudhakar and I have been talking about to improve our execution, to improve our productivity over time and that's what's going to drive a broader expansion on operating leverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of really quick ones. David, I get the idea that the mix shifts towards networking hits gross margins. I guess the -- I would think there would be some offset though given that license as a percentage of revenue is actually going down and maintenance is going up. And maintenance, for the most part, is usually a very high margin business for you guys. So I guess, why wouldn't there be an offset there? I get that you guys are investing to a degree. But you would -- you also had margins that are going to be roughly flat after having a pretty big acquisition last year. So I guess I'm just wondering -- you guys have talked historically that high 20% margins is a reasonable goal for the business. Is that just off the table now, or do we just have to sort of wade through the next 12 months? And then my second question, just so you can answer it quickly, is it -- in your EPS guidance for '14, is there any assumption of buyback activity?","David James Henshall","Sure. In terms of EPS, there really isn't any broader assumption on buyback. However, we will continue to be aggressive in our buyback. We haven't talked about the timing or amount, but we do have currently about $400 million remaining in our existing authorization. In terms of just gross margin, the components there, it's not only the networking, although that is the larger component of it, but also elements of our SaaS business and our professional services business that have been growing faster than other elements of license, and all of those have been putting some pressure on gross margin. So it's a combination of those factors with obviously the strength in networking being the largest factor. And finally, the question about long-term operating margin, our long-term goal is unchanged, mid- to upper-20s is where we expect to operate this business, and we certainly have the potential to do that over a period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","David, I just wanted to be clear. So the desktop business and mobility business have obviously gone through some transition in the last year. But as you think about what happened in Q3 and Q4, did you see anything that suggests a change in win rates or anything fundamentally changed competitively? And then my second question was, as we think about cash flow from operations in 2014, for each of the last 3 years, you've actually seen an incremental increase in the delta between cash flow from operations and non-GAAP operating income. How should we think about that relationship, if you will, between cash flow from ops and non-GAAP operating income in 2014?","David James Henshall","Sure. I think in terms of cash flow from ops, it should continue to grow faster than non-GAAP operating income into '14. In terms of your first question around win rates and competition, it's really a competitive market at this point. Obviously, our primary competitor is investing very aggressively in this area and talking about it a lot more. And so this is -- they've been successful in some areas. A lot of the areas are in the kind of the small-medium enterprise, places where we don't have as much coverage. In terms of win rates at the high end, for the big strategic customers, those are really unchanged. The things that we're doing to address that, and we've talked about a few times on this call, focusing on the channel, focusing on XenApp, focusing on the messaging that has really differentiated these products in the past. And so that's the game plan for '14 right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.","Darren R. Jue - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Darren Jue on for John. I guess just to follow up on the last question, is there anything particular in the quarter that sort of caused cash flow to sort of not track operating income? It looks like cash flow grew about 1%, but non-GAAP operating profit grew about 10%.","David James Henshall","Nothing specific. I mean, there's always some movement with the 2 biggest line items, being accounts receivable and deferred revenue. And then given it's a Q4, whatever true ups there are for some of the annualized accounts, but nothing really unique.","Darren R. Jue - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And one more, I think you mentioned that the pivot to mobile was primarily impacting the midsized market within desktop. I'm just wondering if there's something specific about the midsized market as opposed to the enterprise, why that's having an effect there?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So the midsized segment, the strength or lack thereof there is a function of coverage, as David alluded to, and that's really going to be one of our focus areas from an execution standpoint in 2014 as it relates to channel program, channel training and basically engaging the channels of the new products that we have come out because historically, XenApp has been a channel-led product and basically, as part of our reinvigoration efforts, that's our focus. It's got nothing to do with the pivoting to mobile as much as coverage and channel and focus on XenApp.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","David, within your 8% to 10% revenue guidance for the year, what product revenue growth assumptions are contained within that?","David James Henshall","Yes, we really haven't broken it out in terms of individual line items. But I'll say at least for Q1, the expectation ought to be for product license to be in the mid-single-digit range.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on NetScaler, you mentioned that it did have good balance this quarter between enterprise and cloud. Realizing that cloud-based deals are inherently lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, just wondering if you could talk about your confidence level in getting large cloud deals done over the course of a full year, whether it be a function of data center expansion, new applications or something else.","David James Henshall","Yes, there's a lot of data centers that are being built right now and a lot of capacity that's going on as new cloud services are coming online. And so when we look back at last year, I mean, it was really only -- well, over the last, let's say, 6 quarters, it was really only Q3 that, that segment of the business was on a relative basis a little bit weaker. I mean, in most quarters, what we call cloud, SP and telco will contribute about 25% to 40% of the mix. So it will be within that range would be my expectation. There's certainly opportunities in the pipeline as we look at Q1 and into the rest of 2014.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","But the 3 primary, call it, drivers if it's in the enterprise, one, as customers modernize their data centers, getting to software-defined data centers, obviously there's a significant NetScaler play there. Equally, there's been intense focus on our part to attach NetScaler with XenApp and desktop motion, and that's bearing significant fruit as well. Last but not least is the attach of NetScaler with our XenMobile product line to, as you know, to deliver scalable enterprise management, mobility management that is secure. You need very strong networking capabilities as well, and that's where NetScaler comes into play and that's a significant differentiation -- differentiator against the competition for us. So as XenMobile expects -- or expands, you should see additional progress from us on NetScaler as well.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one, obviously, XenMobile closed out the year pretty strongly. You have a lot of optimism for 2014. If you could just address how your largest competitor's acquisition of AirWatch might change things competitively.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So the first thing I would say is that their acquisition validates in more than one way the strategy that we've laid out well over a year ago and have been executing various parts of it for the better part of 2 years. What we are noticing, and as you saw from our results as well, is that customers are not focusing on just deploying MDM solutions, but broader, secure productivity enhancing applications, content management and basically doing it in a very scalable fashion. And they are also expecting consistent experiences as an unified storefront for native mobile apps, as well as Windows apps rather than deploying discrete and siloed architecture. And that's really whether we have made a mark for us by not only setting the agenda from an enterprise mobility management for -- it's not just about MDM but about applications, secure, productivity enhancing applications, content management, high-end networking, all with a common, consistent experience. So we feel very good about our competitive position there. And the competition, notwithstanding the acquisition, is largely focused on MDM. And I believe they have to either acquire or integrate or otherwise invent multiple pieces of the solution to be close to the capabilities that we currently have and are delivering.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's Rick Sherlund. A couple questions. First, this mix of professional services, it looks like the growth rate accelerated quite a bit in Q4. I'm curious if that's something that will continue. I think you mentioned that might be one of the factors in margins. And then just on the XenMobile side, I'm curious what it is that you think for the next year or so your focus is going to be. Is it integration so that you're able to cross-sell more effectively? What is it you think gives you real sustainable advantage in that segment of the market?","David James Henshall","Yes, Rick, let me answer the professional services question, and Sudhakar will talk about XenMobile. In terms of professional services, I mean, that does tend to be tied to large transactions. So we had a big jump in Q4. So I think next year, it will still move around from a year-over-year percentage point. But from a growth rate standpoint, think about it in -- more aligned with overall revenue guidance at this point.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","And on the XenMobile side, the way I would characterize it is we have already established and delivered on our architectural superiority and completeness of solution as it relates to application and content management. The focus in 2014 is to continue to focus on adding additional applications, integrating our solutions much more completely and effectively, as well as relentlessly focusing on end-user experiences and administrative experience. So those are the 3 main areas of focus for our team even as we expand our ecosystem and our application portfolio.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And Sudhakar, if I could just follow up on desktop virtualization, that part of the business. The ROI is getting better. It seems like it's always kind of a seductive proposition. What are the customers telling you right now? I mean, they're obviously not saying, well, it depends how you sell it and where your focus is. But are you sensing -- is this just not a high priority for them right now? What are they -- what kind of pushback do you hear from customers?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So we're hearing a few things. As you mentioned, the ROI is actually becoming more and more compelling from the standpoint of their infrastructure costs and so on and so forth. But historically, one of the points that customers have already made -- have always made is that it's complex to deploy and leverage. Therefore, adoption was largely restricted to customers that focus intensely on security compliance or otherwise had a need for hosted applications and desktops. So with the changes that we've made to the product where we have greatly simplified the product, as I mentioned, we are at least half -- we take half the step of the nearest competitor in terms of getting our product installed and usable. So we've essentially eliminated the complexity value as well, which we expect will drive greater adoption because as you know, user experiences drive adoption. But increasingly, what we're also seeing is specific verticals that are showing interest in our XenDesktop and XenApp product lines. I mentioned our HDX capabilities. We have enhanced our HDX capabilities as well as on the back-end infrastructure capabilities to participate in design and engineering verticals: verticals that care about data security; verticals that care about large files, for instance; and at the same time, significant compute capacity. These are verticals that will pay a premium for application and desktop virtualization. And through our product innovation that no other company has, we're able to address some fairly large chunks of the workstation and desktop markets. So on one hand, we are simplifying the product to have a very broad horizontal appeal. On the other hand, we are innovating to create new vertical markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Michael Turits. Dave, I don't know if you can -- I was wondering if you could talk maybe a little bit more explicitly about operating margin into next year and what that compression might be. And also, if we could maybe talk a little bit about the desktop license line and the cloud license line into next year?","David James Henshall","Yes, Michael, we're not going to provide guidance at the product line level at this point in time. We've talked about a lot of the moving parts and what areas are doing really well and what area we want to maintain a more cautious position on. So I'd rather just keep it at the aggregate revenue line at this point. In terms of overall op margins, I mean, it's basically flow to gross margin compression down through the model and adjust the tax rate. And that's basically what the primary deltas are.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And so OpEx margin should be about the same in the next year?","David James Henshall","Yes, I mean, we're optimizing spending in all the places you'd expect. We're focused on a lot of the must-win strategic markets that Sudhakar has mentioned. And we're -- areas we're investing incrementally are around the things we've discussed: market coverage, go-to-market coverage around networking, innovation R&D around mobile platforms, data sharing and areas like that. And so that's what our focus will be for next year.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, I just want to make sure I got this straight. In the quarter, I think your networking was up 13%, NetScaler was up 40%. And I don't recall if that was your license number, I think it was. But what was the offset? What was down that much that NetScaler was up 40%?","David James Henshall","Yes, the primary offset was around ByteMobile. Q4 a year ago, we had one really large transaction that it was actually be -- we're able to recognize it all in that order. This quarter, we had strong bookings, but very little of that was recognized in the period. They were all -- well, not all, but the vast majority were multiyear transactions that will come in over the next 1 to 3 years. So that's the primary delta. If you look at that business as a standalone, the recognized license revenue would have been down 50% or so due to these rev recs that we talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just got a question on free cash. A number of your investors value your shares on a free cash flow multiple. So just in light of the guidance for a non-GAAP EPS decline in '14, I just wanted to push a little bit, understanding that you're not going to give precise free cash flow guide. But would you expect free cash flow to be at least up in 2014? And any other parameters you could give us might be helpful.","David James Henshall","Sure. You're right. I mean, it's tough to give a cash flow guidance in -- at a high level. I look back into 2013 cash flow was about -- cash flow from ops was about $5 a share, growing in the low teens. As we look into '14, certainly our goal is to grow cash at a rate in excess of non-GAAP net income. So we'll talk about it more as the year progresses, but that's certainly the goal and what should be expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Ives with FB (sic) [FBR] Capital Markets.","James Moore - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","It's Jim Moore in for Dan Ives. Just with respect to your guidance, it looks like your updates are coming out at a faster clip. I'm just wondering if there's any change to typical seasonality that we might see throughout the year?","David James Henshall","No real change to seasonality. I mean, that business is more impacted by the items that I talked about a few minutes ago and the things that we're doing to address that both in terms of individual, call it, ASP or revenue per customer, as well as just growing top line. I mean, the expectation for that in the first quarter would be about roughly 10% growth year-on-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derrick Wood with Susquehanna Financial.","Rakesh Kumar - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","This is Rakesh Kumar for Derrick Wood. I wanted to ask about XenDesktop 7. How far along are you in the upgrade cycle? Or what percentage of customers have upgraded to the new release?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So I can't speak the percentage of customers that have upgraded to the new release, but we are seeing traction both with the new customers that are adopting XenDesktop 7, as well as existing customers on previous versions of XenDesktop upgrading to XenDesktop 7. Like I alluded to earlier, the feedback that we've received in terms of all of the value drivers that we came up with, which is enhanced mobility, enhanced security, simplicity of the product, those have all been validated. But frankly speaking, it's still fairly early in the cycle. We just came out with XenDesktop 7.1 in the fall, and we're going through the upgrade cycle at this point in time.","Rakesh Kumar - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask about ASPs. As you push with XenApp and project-specific sales and you'll be with the mobile strategy, how should we think about ASPs going forward?","David James Henshall","I think the actual ASP proceeds is really not changed. I mean, ASPs, in the aggregate, will have come down just due to the concentration of large transactions. As you'd imagine, larger transaction, the higher the discount. So as we spread the base out, ASPs may actually increase in the aggregate. So not expecting much change on the byproduct ASP.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two quick questions. You have a very tough compare on networking comp in Q1, and desktop is slightly decelerated -- or decelerating. What will drive the year-over-year growth in Q1? Does desktop reaccelerate? Do you expect networking to grow even faster? How should we think about it? And then another follow-up, quick follow-up.","David James Henshall","Sure, Mark. Yes, like I said earlier, I don't want to start getting into granular guidance. I mean, at this point in time, were -- we talked about overall product license being in the mid-single digits and revenue being in the 8% to 10% range. And I think it's appropriate to leave it at that. I will say that even with the tough comp in Q1, the factors that I talked about are on the networking business: the breadth of what we're doing in the enterprise just expanding the customer base, the fact that we added several hundred new customers net new to Citrix in that business just keeps reducing that dependency that people have called out on large enterprise and Internet-centric accounts over time. So good pipeline, strong growth and we're continuing to increase market footprint and go-to-market coverage. So those are the things to keep in mind around that business specifically.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up specifically on pipeline, how should we think about NetScaler in terms of your visibility into pipeline as compared to the other sides of the business, especially as that grows and as you have Cisco involved in channel, et cetera? Do you still have the same sense of comfort in the detail into the pipeline in the longer-term numbers?","David James Henshall","Yes, in fact, I think we have better visibility into closure around NetScaler pipeline because those transactions tend to be very specific and based on capacity requirements to customers and\/or security projects or things that are, I hate to call them must-dos, but ones that are certainly more visible. When you get into larger transformational desktop virtualization or that type of pipeline, those tend to be harder to specifically measure and time as to when those are going to close because transformation is one of those areas that customers do have some flexibility on, moving in from quarter-to-quarter. That's certainly been a problem over the last couple of quarters to nail down specific transactions. So the cycle times and the pipeline closure rates are, I'd say, shorter and more visible in the networking business than really anything else, frankly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Zeller with Needham & Company.","Robert Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Needham & Company. I wanted to ask about the performance in Europe. Can you give us an update on your confidence with the field organization over there? The results have been inconsistent, but positive this quarter. Could you just tell us your comfort level with the field organization?","David James Henshall","Yes, Europe had a tough year. I mean, there's been a fair bit of rebuilding of the team. Carlos is doing a great job of getting his new team in place and getting everybody focused on the long term. I'd say in Q4, looking at it by region, Middle East had a strong quarter, growing somewhere around 50% year-on-year. We saw good business in places like Russia. Germany, U.K., we're good. I'd say Southern Europe is the place that we've had the most volatility, and that's just more of a macro statement than anything else. That was one that becomes fairly challenging. Also, as I mentioned a couple of times today, the networking strength that we have seen is really just a result of the investments that we've laid out and talked about all year. I mean, we're seeing networking growing on that 40% to 50% range over the last couple of quarters because we just have coverage now. We have the ability to interact with customers that we didn't have before. So we're not done. We got a lot of investments to still make there in coverage and a lot more opportunity. So of all of our regions, that's one that will continue to have a little choppiness from a market standpoint -- just a macro standpoint, excuse me, and we'll deal with that in the ordinary course.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?","David James Henshall","Yes, thank you, and thanks everyone for joining us. I mean, as we've talked about today, we're helping customers embrace mobile workstyles. We're mobilizing apps, data and people. It's all powered by Citrix cloud infrastructure and services. So we're really encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in several parts of our business, and we're confident that we have the right strategies, solutions and focus going into 2014. So thanks, again, for everyone joining us on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in 3 months. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's Citrix conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5393":["Citrix Systems, Inc.

Participating on the call will be Mark Templeton, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Henshall, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Sudhakar Ramakrishna, Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Enterprise and Service Provider Division.","This call is being Webcast on Citrix Systems' Investor Relations Web site. The Webcast will be posted immediately following the call. Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations Web site.","I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.

David?","David J. Henshall","Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Throughout the first half of the year, we continued our pivot towards mobile, recognizing that customers are looking for better ways to embrace mobility and leverage the full power of cloud infrastructure.","In Q2, we hosted our annual Citrix Synergy event, bringing together our worldwide customers, sales teams, and partners, demonstrating unique innovations and the breadth of our technologies for mobile workspace infrastructure and apps.","We introduced several new products, including the Citrix workspace suite delivering apps desktops, data and services under one easy to adopt licensing structure. Improving integrations and creating new opportunities for upgrades as well as the basis for new customer conversations.","We\u2019re also taking direct actions to improve operating efficiencies and return capital to the shareholders. This includes refinements to the portfolio, real estate, delayering and others, initiatives that will continue into the second half. I\u2019m very proud of the Citrix team and our partners whose hard work has been critical as we continue to drive the transition to mobile and cloud.","So let\u2019s review the specifics for the quarter. As you can see from the release, total revenue increased 7% year-on-year to $782 million. Product license grew 2% off a difficult comp from a year-ago. We generated cash flow from operations of over $200 million and adjusted EPS was up sharply to $0.83 through a combination of improved leverage, our accelerated share repurchase, and lower tax rate.","In Q2, we closed 47 transactions greater than $1 million each, up slightly from last year. Roughly half of these came from the Mobile and Desktop business with 4 that included XenMobile as a large part of the solution. Additionally, there was one significant sale that was for the new workspace suite released just in the last couple of weeks of the quarter to an existing XenApp customer looking to adopt the complete infrastructure.","Geographically the EMEA region continues to deliver steady growth and execution, increasing total revenue 8% year-on-year and driving $9 million plus transactions. In the Americas, total revenue was up 4% year-on-year including 33 big deals and the Pacific Japan region grew 8%, including 5 large transactions.","So next, let's look at the Q2 results with our three primary businesses. First, our Mobile & Desktop business grew 4% from last year to $396 million. We've been driving a broader conversation with customers about transforming the delivery of IT services to enable mobile work-styles securely and efficiently.","The XenMobile product has proven to be a catalyst to these conversations and we continue to set the bar in the enterprise mobility market with MDM, mobile productivity apps, virtual apps and data in a unified, secure solution, a product that was again recognized last quarter in the leader squadron by industry analysts.","Similar to the last few quarters, 80% of our mobile platform customers have opted for this complete solution, demonstrating the value of our integrated offerings versus stand-alone MDM technologies. In the aggregate, I\u2019d say we're still very pleased with our revenue and pipeline momentum and while still a relatively small component of overall revenue, mobile platforms grew more than 50% year-on-year in Q2.","The release of XenMobile 9 at the end of last quarter really raises the bar for complete end-user experience in this category and we will continue to improve our competitive differentiation as well as pipeline closure rates going into the second half.","We are also working to address the issues that have impacted overall revenue growth within the desktop and apps part of this business. For the largest most demand in transformation projects, we continue to execute very well. In this segment, we\u2019re winning most every competitive opportunity due to the unmatched breadth and performance of XenDesktop.","To address the broad project specific segment of this market, we\u2019ve reemphasized app virtualization shipping XenApp 7.5 with innovation such as hybrid cloud provisioning where customers are now able to provision and deliver desktops and applications from the cloud. Increasing data center flexibility, disaster recovery, burst capacity and many other business imperatives.","This is an addition to continuing to provide the best application delivery system on the market, as XenApp has always done. We are also accelerating the tools necessary to accelerate customer adoption and migrations in the second half.","For our customer segment, that is looking to consume as a service, XenApp is the foundational technology been leveraged by the Citrix service providers to deliver apps and desktops. This subscription business, which is now serving over 400,000 users, again grew more than 50% year-on-year and now represents about 8% of our app and desktop license mix.","So we're delivering a complete enterprise mobility solution, allowing customers of all sizes to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility on premise or service based and to do with all in a people-centric experience that only Citrix can provide.","So next in our Networking & Cloud business, total revenue increased by 9% in the quarter to $179 million. The NetScaler products were again the major driver of this business, with balanced growth between both enterprise customers as well as cloud service providers.","For a little more context, let me touch on a few metrics from Q2. First, the cross-sell in attach initiatives led to over 550 virtualization orders that included NetScaler as part of the solution. We transacted with approximately 2,100 different customers in the period compared to about 1,900 last year, as we continue to expand our base.","From a mixed perspective, the NetScaler SDX platform represented 17% of NetScaler license sales, while virtual appliances were 8% of the mix growing about 28% year-on-year. And finally, the investments that we've been making and go-to-market coverage, especially in EMEA continue to bear fruit, leading to an 11% growth in that geo off a really tough comparison from a year-ago.","We\u2019re driving innovation in the data center with our unique technologies across both physical and software define networking platforms, powering some of the worlds largest clouds and giving enterprises the capabilities to combine best-in-class app networking services on a single consolidated footprint.","And finally, within our SaaS businesses, revenue was up 12% to $161 million. While overall revenue growth has slowed modestly due to secular pressures in specific markets like remote access, we\u2019re encouraged by the success of many of our new initiatives. For example, our mobile first development focus accelerating product innovation and strategic packaging decisions have all led to a significant increase in year-over-year retention rates for the key products as well as higher Net Promoter Scores. These are examples of some of the foundational improvements that we\u2019ve been focused on that are really necessary to maximize go-to-market effectiveness and accelerate future revenue growth rates.","The communications cloud, which contain services like GoToMeeting, remains the largest part of our SaaS business. This contributed over 60% of SaaS revenue and grew 14% year-on-year.","Our documents cloud, which is led by ShareFile, the data platform that enables robust sharing and sync services really meets the mobility and collaboration needs of users and the data security requirements of IT. This business continues to scale up well in Q2, up 60% from last year and represent a 9% of overall SaaS mix.","And strategically we\u2019re leveraging individual app services across the enterprise solutions to both expand reach as well as differentiation. For example, XenMobile contains an integrated data fabric powered by ShareFile to increase the value of the total solution while giving enterprises the option of leveraging both on-prem and cloud storage platforms to meet their business and security needs.","So let\u2019s turn to operations. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 85%, down a 130 basis points from year-ago as the mix of revenue reflects greater growth in networking and SaaS. Gross margins were roughly flat sequentially and as I mentioned previously we continue to expect this trend to level off as we move into 2015. Our adjusted op margin was 22% in Q2, ahead of expectations due to actions to rebalance resources directly against our most strategic imperatives, refinements to the structure as well as targeted cost actions.","Looking at the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up primarily due to cash flow from operations. And as we\u2019ve discussed previously, we\u2019ve initiated new programs to better optimize our cap structure and programmatically return capital to shareholders.","In Q2, we successfully completed the issuance of $1.4 billion in convertible securities, while simultaneously initiating a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. This allowed us to buyback an initial 21 million shares of our own stock last quarter and we still have over $400 million remaining under the current authorization. And finally deferred revenue increased over $1.4 billion in Q2, growing $19 million sequentially and up over 12% year-on-year.","So turning to our current outlook and expectations for 2014, I'd like to first provide some context around our guidance. We expect to see the strongest forward growth coming from our networking, mobile platforms, and data sharing businesses. The strength in networking, as we saw this quarter, will continue to pressure gross margins when compared to year-over-year which ultimately impacts operating margin.","But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the first half results and improving execution we\u2019re seeing across many parts of the business. We will be investing in the areas necessary to reignite license growth, but with a focus on continuing to optimize our business model and margin profile.","We\u2019re going to maintain our current year, full-year -- current full-year expectations for total revenue growth, but feel confident in raising our estimate for EPS reflect expense and capital structure initiatives. So for fiscal year \u201914, our expectations are now for a total revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10%, adjusted gross margin in the range of 84% to 85%, adjusted tax rate between 22%, 22.5%, and adjusted EPS of between $3.20 and $3.25 per share.","With respect to Q3, we expect total revenue in a range of $765 million to $775 million, adjusted gross margin between 84% and 85% and adjusted EPS between $0.70 and $0.73 a share.","So now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarter\u2019s performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m really pleased with our performance and results for Q2, and really proud to deliver operating efficiencies while driving our very strategic and significant pivot to mobility.","As we move into the second half, we will continue operational refinements while staying aggressive with our solutions for customers business mobility needs. But some of our innovations from workspace delivery infrastructure to business mobility apps is our engine for delivering customer value, competitive differentiation, and profitable growth.","In the last month, I began my 20th year on the Citrix team and I\u2019m truly excited to continue that amazing journey. My passion for our team, our partners and our mobile workspace vision is unwavering and my conviction to the Citrix belief that work is not a place is stronger than ever. And on a personal level, I\u2019m thrilled, energized and looking forward to the years ahead.","Today I\u2019d like to highlight just a few areas where we\u2019re especially focused with our mobile workspace strategy. The first is the virtual desktops and apps where we recently took a number of important steps to extend our Windows app delivery leadership and to accelerate XenApp upgrade value.","Attendees of synergy loved the new security, performance, management, and mobile experience capabilities they saw. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen excellent response to the preview of the migration toolkit that gives customers a smooth path to the new XenApp.","We are continuing to expand on virtualization use cases to include cloud-enabling of the world\u2019s most compute, graphics and storage intensive apps. This is called RaaS, Rich Apps as a Service in an area we\u2019ve been pioneering for sometime with NVIDIA, a long time partner of ours.","We are also working closely with some other partners, Intel and HP. Recently we debuted some breakthrough price performance for rich apps delivered by HP\u2019s new Moonshot platform, the new XenApp and Citrix HDX technology. So we\u2019re continuing to lead the virtual apps market with the unified scalable architecture that provides the most high fidelity user experience that delivers the broadest range of windows virtualization solutions and runs on premise in public clouds or in both. This gives customers the breadth of solutions they need, avoids the cost and pain of lock-ins and harnesses the flexibility, elasticity, and economics of local, regional and mega clouds.","Next is enterprise mobility, an emerging fast growing market where our pace of innovation has produced 7 XenMobile releases in the last six quarters. XenMobile 9 launched in May, is the first to bring the core elements of enterprise mobility together, device and app security, cross-platform app delivery and mobile productivity apps, all in a unified platform that works seamlessly with XenApp and XenDesktop.","XenMobile leverages our SaaS app products, our mobile app platform and our delivery networking infrastructure. They together, they provide a differentiated complete solution for our customers. XenMobile 9 is a fantastic release that includes beautiful Citrix mobility productivity apps, seamless XenApp and XenDesktop integration and expanding number of apps from our ecosystem partners.","Early this year we began offering XenMobile cloud edition and from here you could expect us to continue the fast pace innovation, integration, and simplification that will give us broader reach with our channel partners and deeper adoption with enterprise accounts.","The last highlight is Citrix workplace services, which we previewed at Synergy. CWS is a set of cloud services we will be delivering over the coming quarters. It\u2019s our platform for partners and customers to deliver mobile workspaces on any cloud. It\u2019s built to speed customer adoption by reducing on-premise complexity, leveraging the simplicity of cloud services and enabling the aggregation of mobile Windows and Web based workspace apps.","This announcement continues our history of setting the workplace virtualization agenda for the industry, delivering in customer centric, simpler ways and leveraging both in place and new infrastructure from premise to cloud.","Looking forward, I\u2019m very positive on the trends influencing our business. As we look to the second half and through 2016, we\u2019re focused on six priorities. First is to leverage and grow our virtualization business with a strong focus on upgrading customers, innovations for new use cases, partnering with Microsoft and cross-selling our new mobile and cloud offerings.","Second is to innovate and capture share in enterprise mobility, a growth market where we\u2019ve momentum, significant differentiation and technology leverage in mobile apps, secure data, delivery networking and endpoint security.","Third is to expand our SaaS portfolio of apps and platforms where we can leverage our SMB base, offer great value in business workflows, further address vertical markets and leverage our enterprise customer base.","Fourth is to invest in our delivery networking footprint where we can leverage significant competitive advantages and expanding partnership with Cisco and proven ROI in filling go-to-market coverage gaps.","Fifth is to accelerate our focus on service provider partners, who are already using our infrastructure to deliver over 1.5 million business ready desktops and apps as a service and will serve as a thriving route to customers in the new mobile and cloud era.","And sixth is to begin the delivery of our workspace services cloud that taps technology, talent, and integrations across all of Citrix, enabling new offerings for delivering infrastructure and workspace apps and serving as a foundation for predictable recurring revenue streams.","So this is how we will exceed expectations of investors, partners, customers, and from within. Its how we will reinforce our belief in the employee value of a great place to work, the customer value of beautifully useful products, the shareholder value of profitable growth and the deep felt pride in helping people work better and live better. I\u2019m thrilled to continue the journey.","I\u2019d like to close by reiterating our commitment to operational efficiencies and portfolio optimization and for accelerating growth and margins over the long-term. And now, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions.","David J. Henshall","Operator, okay to open-up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Justin Rowley - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hey guys, this is Justin on for Heather. Just wanted to ask a question on your MDM strategy and sort of what are the key differentiators there and what conversations are you guys having with the sales force? How are they kind of prioritizing this with other offerings that would be helpful? Thanks.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Sure. This is Sudhakar. I will take that question and David and Mark will add to my comments as they see fit. First, we look at the world as being much broader than MDM. Obviously, we believe we\u2019ve best-in-class MDM capabilities, but increasingly we believe MDM is a feature, sometimes embedded within the devices themselves by the device manufacturers and often times by vendors such as us. Our portfolio strategy on mobility spend much further than MDM. First, I want to highlight that when we talk about mobility, we talk about the mobility of windows applications as well in the context of XenApp and XenDesktop. So for us mobility is a much broader place than simply MDM. But coming to our XenMobile products specifically, we\u2019re focused intensely on what we call secure productivity applications, in other words enabling our customers to enjoy as Mark quoted beautiful experiences at the same time incredibly secure applications that enables productivity. Many of the applications are also written by our partners and we look at MDM plus application management, plus content management with a integration -- disintegration of ShareFile. And so that\u2019s where our differentiation comes about, which is the completeness of vision and our ability to bring all of our products together into integrated solutions for our customers in a secure fashion, delivering mobile experiences all throughout.","Justin Rowley - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. You guys refer to operating efficiencies trying to drive that and you talk about -- little bit about rebalancing the portfolio. I was just wondering if you could give us more color on those initiatives.","David J. Henshall","Yes, Steve. It\u2019s Dave. I mean in terms of operating efficiencies this is obviously been a topic that\u2019s been in the middle of the conversation for a long time and we\u2019ve talked about our longer term goals and where we\u2019d like to see our margins run on a continuous basis across the Company. And then on more of a short-term point of view, our guidance would imply probably a 25% to 50% increase and adjusted operating margin from where it was as of last quarter and how we\u2019re getting there is a number of different vectors. One of them is just overall let\u2019s call it cost focused and disciplined that all companies go through. Another one has been in specific delayering activities, in some cases we\u2019ve been optimizing locations and facilities to be able to bring down the overall physical in footprint, while increasing density. But probably most importantly is a general rebalancing behind the scenes to make sure that we\u2019ve got the people really focused on the most strategic initiatives across the Company. Mark mentioned the priorities in some of his prepared remarks that really focused on reaccelerating app and desktop business, growing and leveraging enterprise mobility expanding our SaaS portfolio and apps as they cut across, all of the enterprise solutions and of course continuing the success we\u2019ve seen in our application delivery network. So those are really the big, big areas. And there is no one initiative, but it\u2019s a broad focused and high priority for us as the management team.","Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Terrific. And then just a quick follow-up, the XenMobile. In the past you had talked about maybe hoping to double that business during 2014. I don't know that was a formal kind of guidance or something that was just less formal, but is that still something that\u2019s possible this year with that business?","David J. Henshall","Yes, I think so. When we talked about -- I mean that\u2019s still our goal. When we talked about the numbers, I mean that was on a product license basis. On a bookings basis, including all elements that actually grew significantly faster than that. So overall, the business is moving in the direction we\u2019d like it to. The pace of product innovation that we\u2019ve been on has been very intentional. I mean, we\u2019ve been focused on a lot of the things we\u2019ve discussed over the last few quarters to drive deep integrations and really the differentiated approach to enterprise mobility versus simple MDM that tends to exist in the rest of the marketplace. So that was Phase 1. Phase 2 was about really focusing on end-user requirements and end security I\u2019d say, to make sure that we\u2019ve the best end-user experience out there. That\u2019s been one of the things that allowed us to increase pipeline closure rates and continue the efficiencies. And then the last thing that is work-in-process right now is really on the -- what I call the backend components to make the ability to drive leverage across our broader field organization and our channel organization, much more efficiently, let\u2019s say. And those are the big three areas we had been on and all three of those have helped us yield a better pipeline closure rate and accelerate the business overall. So we\u2019re on that continuum. We are moving fast and expect us to continue to deliver a lot of innovation on this front.","Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Maguire from CLSA. You line is open.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited","Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could discuss how you at the conversations you're having with partners and customers are changing as you make the move from selling discrete products to workspaces and if your -- as this is involving much more of a business case, how does that change your go-to-market?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Ed, great question. I\u2019d say first of all, it\u2019s an extension of the strategic desktop virtualization conversation that we\u2019ve built go-to-market in high touch capability around for the last several years, because the focus of most large organizations is around the security and enablement that comes from mobility. And so our FI partners certain as like Wipro, like IBM, like Accenture and others are certainly helping us in that conversation both on the strategic and on the implementation front. And then obviously we\u2019ve invested pretty heavily and being able to have that conversation with customers ranging from our field force and training and so forth and how we\u2019re organized there, but also in the investments we\u2019ve made in briefing centers and staffing there and we will had another record half in terms of growth of strategic briefings. So and those custom -- those conversations are really about mobility as Rama referred to in the more general sense and they\u2019re less about technical solutions and more about business solutions and value that are related to facilities and redesigning physical workplaces for greater density. There conversations about globalization and taking advantage of workforces that are in different places around the world for economy or being closer to customers. There are conversations about employee retention and engagement especially with the digital generation making such an impact now in terms of the employee populations and mobility is a key aspect of engagement and retention there and recruiting. And so, I could go on, but it\u2019s those kinds of conversations that we\u2019re having with customers that are holistic around mobility. And our products now are end-to-end focused and perspective and experienced in terms of mobile going back to when the company was really about remote access really makes us the trusted, most logical partner to talk to about this. And then obviously we\u2019re extending that through partners. And then the way it will play out is that our service provider partners will become a much more important part of this motion in 2015 as we cloudify the end-to-end capabilities as well as many of our Citrix solution advisors are already service providers, and we\u2019ll do that on much more of a localized basis. So, it will shift more and more to service providers and a broader conversation.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited","Great. It\u2019s great to hear you\u2019re staying onboard market. Thank you.","Mark B. Templeton","Thank you, Ed. I appreciate it so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital","Thank you and congrats on a great quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the linearity you saw in the quarter in terms of the geographies or just maybe talk about kind of broader trends you see there, I mean, I saw Europe had the stronger growth, America was okay I guess against tough comps. Lot of people struggled in Asia, but you were okay. Just help us understand how it feels out there? Thank you.","David J. Henshall","Sure, Raimo, it\u2019s David. Let me characterize in a couple of ways. One, in terms of individual products I would say that the business around networking was actually fairly linear, it\u2019s more linear than anything else. We had large volume of orders come in early in the quarter. Some of those were through the large cloud service providers that are out there that tend to order in small frequency, but large size. I would say the large transactions for desktop and mobile, those look like they would in any quarter tend to be more backend loaded into the third month, and that\u2019s cutting across all geos. More specifically just to get down one level, I\u2019d say that overall desktop and mobile had good quarters for desktop solutions in both EMEA and APAC. Mobile platforms as I mentioned earlier drove revenue up north of 50% year-on-year. Networking and Cloud pretty good quarters everywhere especially in U.S. and EMEA. So the one thing I pointed out just briefly in my prepared comments is that we actually had a large transaction come in for the complete suite which is interesting because we had just released that in the last few days of the quarter, and that is an interesting early opportunity as we look at the installed base and customers are looking to adopt the broader solution. So, what that was, was actually a renewal of subscription advantage that instead of just doing a simple XenApp renewal, the customer decided to go a much broader deployment of multiple technologies and decided to upgrade or trade up as we call it to the full workspace suite. So, that will be a motion that we push more in the back half of the year and the impact will be obviously uplifting overall ASP to customers, driving broader set of products out there and providing overall uplift long-term to the license update and subscription volume as well.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital","Lovely. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Congrats on a great quarter. I just have a couple of questions really on just the product feature side and just roadmap here. Obviously you had the Nike and then the Artemis releases over the past six months on the XenMobile side, Artemis being XenMobile 9.0 late this quarter. What if you can talk about just sort of the impact that you believe you\u2019ve seen from these releases, and sort of just where you are in terms of just your feature inclusion versus the competition maybe versus where you were a year ago? And then I just have one follow-up beyond that.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Sure. I\u2019ll address the product aspect of XenMobile. As you mentioned XenMobile 9.0 which was code named Artemis. We just released it a few weeks ago. We included a number of extensions to existing applications like for instance, I believe we are getting to be close to best-in-class from a mail application for instance, but at the same time have expanded the portfolio of applications as well. But increasing these stepped up security capabilities. As you know with mobility, security becomes even more important especially with some of our larger customers where the boundaries of the enterprise are being increasingly blurred. So there is an intense focus on adding security capabilities while maintaining great user experiences. We don\u2019t want to stifle users just because we have security capabilities. So, that\u2019s been a key area of focus for us. The third aspect of it while expanding our user experience capability has also been around simplicity of setup and administration. So those are all factors that we have adapted to and implemented with a great amount of speed as Mark and David mentioned in the XenMobile 9.0 portfolio. The early feedback I would say has been extremely positive and encouraging. In fact one of our Fortune 100 customers who has deployed the Artemis release has given us their internal experience as exceeding any that they have had with any enterprise IT software. So while it is still very early days, we are incredibly encouraged by the differentiation, the innovation and the customer adoption to our particular product line here on XenMobile 9.0. Going forward a lot of the focus is going to be on simplifying administrative experiences, cloud enabling our XenMobile product where we are seeing much further and faster progress in terms of adoption, as well as increasingly making it a channel and partner friendly such that our penetration into all size enterprises continues to grow.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Got it. Just as a guy whose IT shop pushed out Artemis to him, it definitely does seem to be night and day versus Nike, so thanks for that. And then just a follow-up I have is on XenApp and XenDesktop 7.6. So we have XenMobile 9.0 out, XenApp and XenDesktop 7.6 you guys talked about at Synergy coming out in Q3. I just wonder if you could provide us an update on that. And then Mark maybe you could give us your thoughts on the impact of those as we go into the second half. Thanks.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Yes, we\u2019re \u2013 at this point we\u2019re not making any product launch announcements on any new versions of XenApp or XenDesktop, but it\u2019s very clear that we\u2019ve talked about where we\u2019re headed at Synergy, Phil, and where we\u2019ve got incredibly strong feedback from customers at Synergy including feedback on the preview of the migration tools. And as I said earlier, we think the next release is the tipping point release for XenApp for many customers that were looking for feature parity and then some of the new capabilities that they\u2019ve seen in XenDesktop around the backend components as well as hybrid provisioning as well as additional security, endpoint capabilities around let\u2019s say Chrome OS, Chromebooks et cetera. And it\u2019s kind of a good list of things that they\u2019re actually looking forward to. And I think this next release will have a big impact because I think there\u2019s a lot of pent up demand if you will for moving forward in a big part of the customer base and partner base with XenApp and to do that with this incredible migration toolkit that we put together as well as some of the things that we showed that will change the price performance dynamics around XenApp in particular infrastructure that we demonstrated on the HP Moonshot platform. So, I think there\u2019s goodness ahead, and it is a catalyst. I think when we\u2019ll start to actually see that in the bookings in all I would imagine we would start to see it pretty quickly after we get the product in the marketplace. So, stay tuned.","Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank AG","Thank you. This question is for David. Just wondering if you could provide a bridge for the non-GAAP EPS performance of $0.83 which is appreciably above the guide that you offered at the May Analyst Day. I know there were number of moving factors maybe, the buyback impact, taxes, perhaps the cost reduction initiatives in 2Q were little bit more than you were anticipating in May, but maybe you could just provide a bridge for us. And it looks as if the magnitude of the beat is not getting translated into a full-year non-GAAP EPS lift, so maybe you sort of front-end loaded some of those cost initiatives in 2Q, perhaps you could just comment on that? Thanks.","David J. Henshall","Sure. Just to bridge it back to your prior guidance because it was a pretty material upside. About 4 pennies of that would be attributable to tax items, and those items were not included on our guidance. So, of the delta, I\u2019d put about 4 pennies into tax. But the large majority of it was due to out-performance of the operating income line which is of course where you\u2019d like it. And that was a combination of more higher performance on revenue, so more upside on the top line. And then specific action we have been taking in some of which I touched on at a very high level around cost. I mean, it is a large focus of not so much cost, that\u2019s just making sure that investments are targeted towards the right areas; we\u2019re driving the most efficiencies out of those. That\u2019s probably the way I would characterize it. And then the work that we\u2019re doing below the line on capital structure returning more shares in the second quarter. So, as far as overall guidance, we\u2019re uplifting the EPS on the full-year largely due to the operating performance you saw on Q2. We\u2019re maintaining the top-line revenue growth, and we are going to take a conservative posture into the back half. I mean that hasn\u2019t changed from where we were the last couple of quarters. I think its appropriate given that we are still ramping several new initiatives right now, and we had a challenging second half last year. And until we have many more quarters of continued sustained performance I think maintaining the conservative bias is the place we\u2019d like to be. So that\u2019s the way to bridge the guidance from March and the out-performance you saw in the -- excuse me, the guidance in May and the out-performance you saw in the actuals.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, that makes sense. And if I could just ask a follow-up, and I think you may have just answered it. If we look at your revenue guidance for 3Q it implies about the same 7 percentage growth that you just posted in 2Q. 2Q was an awfully tough comp, so you did well this quarter. So the growth is staying the same in 3Q. Is the explanation for that despite the easier comp that you\u2019re taking this conservative posture with respect to the revenue guidance as well?","David J. Henshall","Yes, our guidance was 0.2 roughly 7 to 10 I think growth in revenue in Q3, major year-on-year. And yes, I think Q3 was the challenging quarter last quarter. It is the summer quarter, and in EMEA and other places in the world. So we want to maintain the conservative bias. That\u2019s nothing more to read into it besides that.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank AG","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Hi, thanks. So, Mark great to have you back as CEO permanently and I think nobody could envision a Synergy without you up there on stage. I guess what I wanted to kind of get a sense of is, you had some time to reflect and come back and we\u2019ve gotten to know your management style pretty well, but I\u2019m wondering how we should expect things, things may change with you having stepped back and come in as -- [ph] [reback] in here as CEO, is there any -- should we expect there to be kind of any different way that you run the business or think about decisions to make for the business?","Mark B. Templeton","Well, thanks Walter. Thanks for the kind words. I appreciate them. So, yes the perspective of the personal leave has had a number of impacts on me and how I looked at things. And mainly through the lens of how I can, the much more active and a catalyst on making sure we make tradeoffs and set priorities and speed up some of the decision making processes internally. And so, if you go back to the list of priorities the six priorities I talked about, what you\u2019ll find then behind that is much better alignment into the organization around these that lets us make decisions around investments flowing between products and go-to-market teams et cetera. And pretty deep in the organization looking at organization talent, investments we want to make that we haven\u2019t been able to make because of opportunity costs and by refocusing we\u2019re able to make them. So, a lot of that perspective coming back in, but still I\u2019m the same person, and I\u2019m still here to steward the company through I think another pivot with in the last 20 years stewarded the company through several and this is another. And I think this is the most exciting one of all, and we have the most broad portfolio that by far the most talented team we\u2019ve ever had on a relative basis. So, that\u2019s sort of what's different, but most of it is the same with the perspective of having been on leave for some months.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","And then David, just a quick one for you on the trade-up program. We saw number of years ago you ran a trade-up which was really effective in jumpstarting XenDesktop there for a while. And I think your channel knows how to work with that sales motion. Can you talk about sort of impact you saw here in Q2, might have been kind of early, but what we should expect Q3, Q4 as that trade-up gained some steam?","David J. Henshall","Sure, Walter. It was very little in the quarter because we had just released the products within the last few days of the quarter when they started shipping. I did call out one large transaction, the customer that had been XenApp customer for a long time, and they knew the products well and they use this as an opportunity to embrace a broader technology stack, most specifically mobile. So, I think the motion is going to serve a couple of purposes. One, it allows us to uplift ASP, so it drives license revenue; B, it allows us to drive a larger subscription stream over long-term because the annual ARR is not only just larger based on the size of the ASP, but its also larger because it\u2019s a complete maintenance offering versus standalone subscription advantage. And then lastly, it\u2019s a great way for customers that have thought about app or desktop virtualization strategically are ready to extend that into the context of mobile. So, I do think it will be helpful in the second half. We\u2019re not going to talk about specific expectations yet. But I think of many of the tactical activities this is an important one going into the back half.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Pacific-Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Rob Owens - Pacific-Crest Securities","Great, thank you very much. I want to focus a little bit on the desktop solutions number in the quarter. If I just look at the year-over-year growth it\u2019s been the slowest it\u2019s been in quite some years and I realize there was a tougher comp. But with you no longer given the different components and talking about the success you\u2019re seeing in XenMobile, just maybe some color from 30,000 feet. And then you\u2019ve got a competitor in that space obviously that\u2019s making a lot of noise. So, maybe help us out in terms of the competitive environment, what you\u2019re seeing at this point where customers are? Thanks.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","I\u2019ll take the crack at it. In terms of the competitive environment, I presume you\u2019re referring to some of the more recent releases that is Horizon 6 from the competition. I would say that, while we see VMware in a lot of circumstance and situations. As we do our win loss analysis, we are really not getting displaced or won against by VMware. And as it relates to Horizon 6 specifically its early days, we haven\u2019t really seen a lot of it in action. But what little we have seen, I don\u2019t believe we have really lost to them in any major deal or getting displaced. Our focus has been on doing certain fundamental things that be in some cases have not done a very good job or for instance in the past we have highlighted that we are reinvigorating XenApp and bringing that back into focus. So we came out with our XenApp 7.5 release earlier this year and we continue to build on it, because we made our mark with application virtualization and also built a significant strength in desktop virtualization. What we are observing now is increasingly we have to expand the market in certain segments as well as be much more focused in the use cases that we deliver. For instance security continues to be a significant use case that we deliver with these solutions and that has been an area of focus for us. The next big use case is in the broader context of mobility. If you think about our receiver portfolio, we have significantly expanded the receiver portfolio both organically and working with partners such as Google, and that has opened up additional applications for us specifically in the retail sector. Mark made the reference to RaaS which admittedly was not something that we could have supported in the past years technology limitation, but those have all been overcome now and we\u2019re much more focused on verticalizing XenApp and XenDesktop and attacking some of the vertical markets that are opening up opportunities. So, together with product improvements that I just outlined, as well as new markets and segments that we are penetrating to expand the overall opportunity base, and integrating XenApp and XenDesktop with the broader portfolio of XenMobile and our Cloud networking portfolio and delivering more integrated solutions. We believe we can recover growth and have meaningful growth in the second.","Rob Owens - Pacific-Crest Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you. Let me rattle of a few questions very quickly, and feel free to prioritize them the way you would like -- you would see it fit. One is, Mark and team are you content with your current growth rate and if not, and if the company were to hypothetically accelerate its growth rate next year, what you think would be the driving factors for that acceleration? And secondly, with respect to the DaaS business I think you mentioned 400,000 desktops that\u2019s up incrementally sequentially from 360,000 desktops. That alone in my rough estimation probably drained away 5 to 6 points of license growth, maybe 4 to 6 points of license growth. Can you talk a little bit more about the transformation that\u2019s happening there and how if you believe we should not be looking at your reported revenue growth rate because they maybe misstating the true impact of that, the subscription transformation? And finally your thoughts on the VMware Safe Passage program for Citrix customers. Thank you very much.","Mark B. Templeton","Sure, Kash. Let me take the DaaS question and then ask Mark and Rama to talk about Safe Passage and just the overall growth rate. So, specific to, well I guess, DaaS which is not the term we really use, but we talk about apps being delivered -- apps and desktops being delivered by our CSP partners. We have couple of 1000 partners that are engaged now with over 400,000 end users. And probably the best way for us to think about that is, not so much of replacement of an existing XenApp, but really a market expansion play. We don\u2019t have perfect information to say that it would have been or would not have been a perpetual base sale. But I think the motion that is being addressed right now is that for a large segment of the population abstracting away the complexity of on-prem infrastructure and being able to consume what we refer to as finished goods, whether that\u2019s is a complete desktop with a set of thin verticalized apps tends to be what we see in many cases. Now that allows customers to simply consumer what they need. So, lots of SMB, lots of prosumers that type of customer. That\u2019s definitely a growth focus of ours going forward. I mentioned that it\u2019s approaching 10% of the license mix, its still high single-digits but growing substantially. Over time I would expect more and more of that revenue to continue to migrate more towards recurring sources. I think not so much in 2014 but as we go into the next couple of years and work space services become another way to again abstract away complexity from customers, easing adoption, easing expansion and the things they don\u2019t really hold back technologies like this from going broad base. So stay tuned on that front, but really an important segment of the market but hard for us to say whether it is cannibalizing others or not. I think it\u2019s more of a market expansion. Rama, if you want to talk about Safe Passage ","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Sure. Let me provide some context Kash on that. First as customers deploy XenApp and XenDesktop they are focusing on some, I would say business critical imperatives that they have. For instance security, productivity of their uses, delivering great experience\u2019s in fixed and mobile use cases and so on. While cost is important, I wouldn\u2019t place that at the top of the list as it relates to considerations when they deploy app and desktop virtualization. So, when the competition talked about Safe Passage, I would humbly submit I\u2019m not so sure it is safe for customers. Because many times when they talk about migration there\u2019s really no real migration tools that are being offered. It\u2019s the cap and grow or rip and replace in many cases. That really causes more harm to the customers installed base and the experiences and productivity of their uses then getting some near-term financial benefit for an expense that they have already incurred for the most part. So it\u2019s unclear to me from a business value standpoint if there\u2019s anything material for customers through programs such as this, and I\u2019d look at it as another form of discounting and nothing more. Our focus is truly to continue to drive innovation in XenApp and XenDesktop and focus on the security, the mobility as well as the productivity dimensions that customers care about and give them options both on-premise and off-premise and give them flexibility of both cost and deployment model [ph] [that way] as opposed to I\u2019d say marketing ploys like this.","David J. Henshall","Kash, your last question about growth rate. So no, we\u2019re not satisfied with our growth rate. We are committed to accelerating, reaccelerating our growth rate. And where that could come from next year and sort of in your theoretical -- somewhat theoretical question, I would say it would be in where there is leverage that\u2019s natural in the business. So first is, the first leverage is in channels. So, to the degree that our CSA partners and the CSP partners actually are able to be more effective and more efficient in going to market with our SPLA licensing around XenApp, and the new XenApp and XenDesktop to the degree that they are -- they get some early traction with CWS and to the degree that they, that we \u2013 they take onboard the XenMobile product line in a deeper, broader way which are all clearly our strategies and game plan, those things are designed to give us leverage which gives us growth and it gives us margin. The other natural leverage is in the customer base, and that\u2019s the customer base in a general sense. The customer base on the enterprise side and the customer base on the SMB side of the business. And to the degree that we are offering valuable enhancements that either increase retention, increase NPF, encourage customers to do their migrations to Window Server 2012 and build on some of the newest converge infrastructure for example that will see a lot of next year. I think those are some good catalysts for improving our growth rate. And where a number of these business priorities that I outlined are focused actually.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Great. Look forward to it. Thank you.","David J. Henshall","Thanks, Kash.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Thank you for fitting me in guys. Obviously, a lot of focus or a lot more focus from you guys both at the analyst day and in the most recent quarter on the margin side of this story. And Dave, you\u2019ve given us some sort of high level targets where you think margin should go. But there\u2019s still little lack of clarity in terms of exactly how we get there. So I was wondering, is there's any chance that you\u2019ll give us sort of targets in terms of the pace of improvement that we could expect in operating margins over the next couple of years, or is there anything programmatic that you expect to go on maybe a formal restructuring or reorganization to sort of better focus the organization on the key growth areas, that could give us some sort of guidance into how sort of efficiencies come into the model over time?","Mark B. Templeton","Sure Keith. I mean, as far as specifics, we\u2019ll give a little bit more directional guidance coming out of this quarters earnings call when we talk about how we\u2019re thinking about the business model for 2015 and beyond. I think that\u2019s the appropriate time to do it. In the short-term we\u2019ll focus on tactical things that we\u2019ve talked about as well as structural things it will be important longer term. Just to highlight something that we\u2019ve all talked about many times is the impact of kind of gross margins on the overall margin structure. That\u2019s been about a 500 basis point decline over the last few years as we\u2019ve been ramping up networking in SaaS and in some of these other areas very aggressively. I do continue to believe that that will plateau out as we go into the back half of this year and into next year. And so that stops becoming a headwind to all the activities that we\u2019ve been driving to just improve efficiencies, let\u2019s say. If you take a step back on a micro level and look at operating expenses as a percent of revenue for example. They declined about 130 basis points year-over-year in Q2. And the biggest change coming from sales and marketing which went from 41% of revenue down to almost exactly 39% I believe, so about 200 basis points there. And a lot of the actions we\u2019re taking show up there. I would also say that, as we look at ramping some of the newer businesses things that have been highly dilutive to both our go-to-market costs as well as our focus, I mean, those continue to get more and more scale as time goes by, for example mobility. And so, it\u2019s really tough to look at the individual pieces, but when you look and analyze the overall motion, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on this front. And as the new businesses grow, we\u2019ll be able to grow into some of that expense that already exists and overlay teams and things like that that are fairly unique investments can be absorbed into a broader motion, they can be leveraged more effectively. So, fairly long answer, but I mean there\u2019s a number of different factor\u2019s that we\u2019re pushing on right now and we\u2019ll be prepared to give more specifics as we go into next year and subsequent periods.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent. And if I could sneak in one follow up. Gross margins obviously have been definitely a headwind over the past couple of years for the overall operating margin profile. I would say that one of the other ones is a pretty steady pace of acquisitions that you guys do to expand into new technologies and bring new technologies onboard. Does the renewed focus on or tighter focus on operating margins, is that going to change at all your M&A strategy or make may be the bar for when you actually go out there and do M&A a little bit higher than it's been in the past?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, I would say our M&A over the last 12 to 18 months has really been focused on smaller tactical acquisitions. Things really to either bring unique capabilities to market which is more of a build buy conversation or just accelerate something that we have to drive for competitive or differentiation purposes, and I think that's been our bias, and that will continue to be our bias in the short-term. We are still ramping new businesses in a couple of areas. We\u2019re happy with the progress we\u2019re making, but we have to continue to maintain that maniacal focus on driving those to where we really like them to be. So, not a lot of change in the short-term, but pretty similar to where we've been I would say looking backwards over the last several quarters.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund from Nomura. Your line is open.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities","Yes, thanks and congratulation on your plan to get more leverage out of the business. I'm just curious to follow-up on that issue of leverage. If we look at XenMobile for example, can you give us a sense of how much of that is being leveraged and pulled along with other products? And maybe just some sense for the dynamics there as well in terms of, to what degree are you starting to see more traction in terms of larger deployments, larger deals sizes, maybe how much of this is being sold into the installed bases with key business versus new, any metrics you can offer us on the front. Thanks.","David J. Henshall","Sure, Rick. Let me throw out a couple of metrics. At a high-level, about half the customers are new in Q2, and it's been a roughly what has been running at for the past couple of quarters. As far as leveraging into others, I mean we\u2019re still in an early nascent phase in this business, we\u2019re ramping pretty aggressively. And I think the place that I\u2019d say installed base customers will have the opportunity to participate more aggressively is around probably the workspace suite as a good first pass. And then of course we\u2019ve got a huge installed base of folks that have already thought about mobility and virtualization and security in a different way. And so that will be obviously one of the primary target areas for our teams to go after as well. As far as large transactions, we had about four last quarter that were in that $1 million plus range that included XenMobile as the primary component of that transaction. So, we\u2019re starting to deploy at a larger and larger scale. And like with any new product those ramp, and so I would expect to see that trajectory continue and potentially accelerate especially XenMobile 9.0 which addresses many of the security concerns or other issues that a large complex organization is going to have as a checklist item. Once those things are now checked off, I think we also have the opportunity to really accelerate on those big scale deployments as well. So, we\u2019re optimistic about the second half of the year in that regard.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities","Just to follow-up on that. I would seem that the market is just kind of slightly penetrated if you look beyond MDM to the broader app and content management space. Do you think the market is going to ripen looking for broader solutions and I\u2019m curious why we haven\u2019t seen broader deployments to date?","David J. Henshall","Well, I\u2019d say a couple of things. One, yes I agree with the market is moving beyond simple MDM and the ability to just control a device is interesting, but not strategic. And to enable more productivity in use cases, controlling broader end of the stack is important. And content data is a really, really important element of that and I think we\u2019ve got a huge differentiation with the level of integrations we can drive with our ShareFile platform. In fact I think we\u2019re the only vendor in the world that shows up in the leaders quadrant in both enterprise think and share as well as enterprise mobility and we\u2019re leveraging that in important ways right now. So we\u2019re on a pretty fast ramp, but I think those will continue to be the strategic level of conversations the customers want to have going forward.","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Rick the thing that I\u2019d add on sort of the ripening dimension is that I think first off, we\u2019re focused on business mobility versus the consumer side of things and what will ripen business mobility around will be the a greater velocity of business built apps, that are either coming out of the mobile enterprise app platform space, coming out of some of the service providers that are specializing on that. And so to the degree that there is an acceleration there, I think that will cause the EMM space to ripen at a much faster pace. And we\u2019re obviously trying to get ourselves in a great position with an integrated solution that takes advantage of about -- everything we know about security at rest and in transit on the network, everything we know about aggregating services of dissimilar types whether they\u2019re Windows, Web, or Mobile, everything that we know about mobile apps themselves, obviously things like GoToMeeting and ShareFile have underlying platforms that we\u2019re monetizing with the Works Suite. So this is getting us critical mass in terms of the core mobile apps we think enterprises especially those that are in highly either regulatory areas or have very dispersed workforces in geographies that are believed to be dangerous in terms of -- from the security perspective. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re preparing for and then the apps once they flow, I think it will ripen the space at much more rapidly.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.","Yes, thanks. Mark, just following up on one of the earlier questions, how should we think about the impact of retirement of Windows Server 2003? How is it going to impact your XenApp business? Kind of what percent of your XenApp customers are currently on Windows 2003 and will the coming release be sufficient to get them over to the next release?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, great question. First of all, it will be a catalyst for pushing customers forward. And especially next year when I think some of the new convergent infrastructure platforms that will be introduced will give our customers an incentive for sort of the hardware end of that conversation. So between those two phenomenon\u2019s I think it will be -- obviously they will have to move and with reinvention of the XenApp sort of product line, especially with the migration tools etcetera. I think it will be definitely one of the catalyst for growth in XenApp. And then I think the same thing goes for Windows Server 2008, unless applications are hardcoded to it in some compatibility way. But Windows Server 2012 is the gold standard at this point and that\u2019s where we see most customers wanting to go and wanting us to help them get there as quickly and efficiently as possible.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.","Thanks. And David if you can just talk about how do some of the acquisitions like ScaleXtreme and Framehawk fit into the product portfolio, and if there was any kind of noticeable impact this quarter from some of those acquisitions? Thank you.","David J. Henshall","Sure, Abhey. As far as those acquisitions, those are technology acquisitions, not revenue generating. So there is no actual revenue that\u2019s coming with either one of those. And we will be talking more specifically about those in the future as they\u2019re really unique and really cool technologies are delivered in product form. So we will -- I will hold off on that for now, but no revenue contribution from those in Q2.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We are taking no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to management.","David J. Henshall","Okay. Thanks everyone. I mean we\u2019re clearly encouraged by the momentum that\u2019s building in several parts of our business and we\u2019re confident that we have the right strategy solutions and focus for the rest of 2014.

Drew?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Dawn. And welcome to everyone joining us today.","Our transition to the cloud continues to gain momentum, driving our Q3 revenue growth rate, which about doubled over last year. Financial highlights include revenue grew 6% year-over-year, led by subscription revenue growth of 37% year-on-year. Our adjusted operating margin was 32%. Adjusted EPS was $1.40 per share, up 16% versus last year. And cash flow from operations was $301 million, a Q3 record, growing 18% over last year.","Q3 was the typical back-end loaded quarter due to summertime seasonality around the world. This impacted the timing of revenue from cloud and subscription transactions, the bulk of which closed in late September. The result was a deceleration in the subscription revenue growth rate from our second quarter. We expect subscription revenue to reaccelerate in Q4, as we'll see a full quarter of revenue from our September transactions, plus the benefit of a typically more linear bookings quarter.","Our Q3 enterprise business was solid, as we closed 55 $1 million-plus transactions, with concentration in healthcare, technology, and government sectors. We saw strength in our cloud and subscription offerings across our portfolio, particularly in Workspace Services as customers embrace our future of work vision, driving higher productivity and employee engagement. All of our geographies grew at a consistent rate, with the transition of enterprises to our subscription offerings strong across all regions.","Citrix cloud simplified hybrid cloud adoption, providing the same infrastructure on-premise or in the cloud. Customers are realizing the value of reduced infrastructure complexity, better overall user experience, increased security, faster access to innovation, and flexibility to align with their business initiative.","Next, let's take a closer look at Q3 results within our primary businesses. Workspace Services maintained its momentum, growing 7% year-over-year to $462 million. This was driven by a continuation of recent trends towards our unified workspace and TFP (04:29) offerings. Within Workspace Services subscriptions were roughly half of the total Workspace product bookings mix in Q3. We also saw stable results in the Networking business. Networking revenue increased 5% year-on-year to $195 million in Q3, with subscription revenue increasing 95% over the last year. This reflects strength of our hybrid cloud offerings, providing the flexibility, performance and visibility as enterprises anticipate and execute their cloud strategies.","Finally, our Content Collaboration revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $47 million in the quarter. As we discussed over the past year, ShareFile is becoming more of an integrated file sync and sharing solution for our enterprise Workspace customers, moving away from its prior focus on just the standalone F&B space. As such, the reporting of the Content Collaboration results will be integrated within our Workspace business during 2019. We'll provide more details on our Q4 2018 earnings call.","Let's now turn to operations. Our adjusted operating margin was 32% in Q3. We'll continue to balance expanding our profitability with the investments needed to support growing pipeline and sales capacity as we transition the business model. As mentioned, cash flow from operations was $301 million, up 18%, bringing our trailing 12-month cash flow to $1.1 billion. Deferred and unbilled revenue combined grew $187 million, or 11% over last year. Unbilled subscription revenue grew nearly 330% or $140 million versus Q3 of last year. Deferred revenue was $1.68 billion in Q3 of 2018. Please note that the adoption of the new Revenue Accounting Standard, ASC 606, creates about a 300 basis point headwind that you will need to adjust for when comparing deferred and unbilled revenue for Q3 2018 to Q3 2017.","At the end of Q3, we had approximately $2.5 billion in cash and investments, and repurchased approximately 1 million shares in the period. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $750 million for share repurchases. This brings our total current authorization for repurchases to approximately $1.1 billion. Since we announced our $2 billion share repurchase program in November of 2017, we've repurchased approximately $1.6 billion at an average price of approximately $91 per share. We expect to complete the remaining $370 million in share repurchases during our Q4. As you can see from our announcement, Citrix's Board of Directors also declared a dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid this quarter. Additional details can be found in today's release.","Now, turning to guidance for Q4 2018 and the full year. In line with our multi-year strategy, we expect to see continued momentum in the adoption of our cloud services and subscription-based offerings. As such, we are increasing our full year guidance for 2018 to include revenue between $2.95 billion and $2.97 billion, adjusted operating margin of 30.5% to 31.5%, and adjusted EPS of $5.55 to $5.60 per share.","We'd also like to provide an initial view into our expectations for FY 2019. Please note that while we are still working through our planning cycle, which is typical at this point in our fourth quarter, in 2019, we plan to continue investing in go-to-market capacity, demand generation, innovation in the infrastructure areas necessary to scale our cloud services. At a high level, as of now, we are currently looking at FY 2019 revenue growth to be about 4%, and adjusted EPS of about $6. Very important to note that behind these numbers, we are assuming that the mix of subscription as a percent of product bookings increases from 40% this year to between 50% and 55% next year. This incremental mix shift will create a 1% to 2% point headwind to the revenue growth rate for next year.","For quarterization, I would encourage you to look back at the historical seasonality of our results for the ramp of margins and EPS throughout the year. 2018 results were skewed due to our 2017 restructuring and the adoption of ASC 606. 2019 operating margin expansion and EPS growth will be skewed towards the second half due to normal seasonality, our continued shift to subscription revenue, and our recent investments in building sales capacity. We'll provide more detail on our next earnings call in January.","I'd now like to turn the call over to David to give further color on the quarter and our areas of focus moving forward. David?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.","As Drew noted, Q3 was just another good quarter of upside to financial expectations while we continue to execute on the transformation across the company. More importantly though, customers and partners are embracing our strategy, really driving the multi-year plan. Despite the headwind from the ongoing mix shift, reported numbers are once again really solid, largely due to the strength of new product bookings for the Citrix Workspace. As you heard, our reported revenue growth doubled over last year, while at the same time the contribution from subscriptions increased from 12% to 15% of total revenue. Regardless of cost discipline, and we delivered a lot of upside against both margin and EPS goals, it's good performance for Q3 which, as Drew pointed out, historically has some seasonality to it due to the summer holidays around the globe.","In the quarter, our Workspace business continued to lead our execution. What's happening here is that the vision we laid out last year for delivering a general purpose Digital Workspace is resonating. Customers are seeing that Citrix adds a lot of value in their long-term initiatives in terms of simplifying hybrid cloud environments, improving security, and accelerating the adoption of new innovation. Additionally, due to the support of all major cloud platform providers, we give customers the flexibility to migrate workloads to and among the clouds of their choice. In total, Citrix Cloud now includes more than a dozen services, with options for staff and hybrid models, as well as services for those customers with only on-premises implementations, to help them manage and monitor their infrastructure much more effectively.","As we talked about last quarter, customer momentum, it really stepped up after our Synergy Sales Conference in May. We got great feedback regarding the alignment and clarity of our strategy, as well as a record volume of new innovations and announcements that we made with great partners like Microsoft, Google, ServiceNow, and Samsung. Our message has been focused on the future of work and how we help lower IT infrastructure costs while delivering higher employee productivity and engagement. The current cloud mobile era of technology has created really unprecedented flexibility in compute and in workstyle opportunities. However, most of the customers we see need to employ a variety of discrete point product solutions to help manage this, an approach that, frankly, is just really complex and very expensive. Our focus has been to help them abstract away as much of the complexity associated with these niche products as possible, and highlight the benefits of our complete integrated solutions.","As we promised, all of the new innovations that we unveiled at Synergy were released for general availability during Q3. And over the next few quarters, we'll be working with customers on the adoption of the Workspace app, providing access to all of their applications and content needed to be productive across all users in the enterprise. This includes differentiated capabilities such as federated identity, unified experience, out-of-the-box integration with leading SaaS apps, a broad approach to universal endpoint management, and, if required, access to Citrix virtual apps and desktops from an easy-to-use, all-in-one interface.","Most importantly, we're now delivering a Digital Workspace for general purpose use, which is ensuring that every employee has access to everything they need to be productive, all in one package. Every employee, every app, on any network. This translates into greater value and productivity for customers, and expanded market opportunity for Citrix.","And in September, at Microsoft Ignite, we announced the development and planned release of a new cloud-based desktop as a service offering, positioning us to gain share in the fastest-growing segment of virtualization market. The Citrix DaaS offering, developed on top of Windows Virtual Desktop and hosted on with Microsoft Azure, enables businesses to deliver services in a turnkey end-to-end solution built with our market-leading HDX technology to provide maximum performance. So stay tuned for further announcements on the future launch dates. Lots of exciting innovation across the board.","So, turning back to Q3. Let me talk about a couple of large transactions that highlight the discussions that we're driving with both new and with our existing customers. The first is a 150-year-old banking organization operating in the western U.S. They have been a longtime XenApp and XenDesktop customers, delivering virtualized applications in media. They started evaluating Citrix Cloud earlier this year as part of their corporate hybrid cloud strategy, but after Synergy, they started looking at the new Workspace app as a potential way to unify existing branch office applications and widely used SaaS-based applications into a single access and user experience. As our evaluations progress, they also embraced Citrix Content Collaboration as a way to deliver secure content to branches, and Citrix Analytics to provide an enhanced visibility and security to their application usage.","This evaluation concluded with a roughly $1 million subscription transaction for our cloud service, using the current customer transition program we put in place a couple quarters ago. Ultimately, we're not only modernizing the management of their virtual apps and desktops, but we're expanding to new users with improved experience in security in additional use cases in SaaS, Web, and mobile apps.","Second example I want to highlight is a global food and beverage company. This company was hit hard by a malware outage last year. It impacted a large number of employees for over two weeks. They asked Citrix to propose a solution that supported existing BPO projects using Azure cloud while at the same time addressing new use cases like BYOB and Mobility all from a single platform. And, of course, security was of paramount concern. Final solution we landed on was a three-year agreement for the Citrix Cloud app service, providing high availability to applications with an Evergreen infrastructure that's continuously managed and updated.","Additionally, secure global access and two-factor authentication will be enabled with our virtual networking, allowing them to also retire their current VPN solution for simplification and cost reduction. Here's just a couple of examples on how our focus on delivering experience, security and choice are proving to be so valuable for both new and existing customers, and why we're winning these types of opportunities. These examples also demonstrate how our customers are committing to us for multiple years, fully validating the direction as part of our current and future roadmap.","So let's talk about Networking for a minute, as revenue in this area was stable in Q3. However, on a bookings basis, the hyperscale SSP segment was actually relatively weak, down about 20% year-on-year, with the enterprise segment growing in double digits. In total, the mix for SSP was 21%, compared to 27% of the mix a year ago. As we've been discussing over many quarters now, the SSP business is highly concentrated, and therefore can be pretty volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Our strategy has been to invest in the larger enterprise market, addressing traditional ADC use cases, hybrid multi-cloud, and DevOps, as data center architectures are gradually shifting more towards microservices. Our software-based approach here to Networking gives us strong flexibility to help customers migrate through this evolution.","Another good example of this in the third quarter was a European mobile network operator and a current ADC customer. Historically, their use of ADC has been fairly simple and pretty straightforward. However, as they looked forward, they requested a proposed solution that was not just NFV-ready, but really more future-proof from an architectural standpoint. The final solution that we delivered and closed as a $2 million contract will include both physical and virtual networking products, integrated with full capacity licensing to enhance their mobile network and provide additional capabilities like TCP optimization, content filtering, and others. This exemplifies how our shift to software-based networking and more flexible and scalable licensing is a step in the right direction in helping grow preferences in this market.","Finally, there are several new SD-WAN wins in a variety of areas, including cross-sell to existing Workspace customers to improve the performance of remote sites, optimize HDX traffic, and other capabilities. While still a relatively small part of the overall business, SD-WAN is growing pretty rapidly right now, and we've launched a number of product and go-to-market initiatives to help support managed service providers, Microsoft Virtual WAN and Office 365, as well as deeper integrations in our Workspace Service.","So as we exit this year, I feel really good about our momentum and purpose. We're more aligned and more focused on the customer success than ever before. Clearly, the financial results are well ahead of our multi-year targets, and we're proving that we can drive a cloud transition and accelerate both revenue and margins. It's a really powerful combination. It's clear that our customers are looking to operate in a multi-cloud, hybrid-cloud world, and Citrix is clearly positioned to provide simple, secure, and unified solutions to help them address these challenges and simplify their roadmaps. We're excited about the future, and I'm confident in the progress we've made so far in 2018.","Thank you very much. And as always, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator, if you can let us know if there's anybody on the line.","Operator","Yes, we have a question from Philip Winslow.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. And congrats on another great quarter here.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Philip.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","The question to the team just on Workspace Services, because obviously you saw another quarter of mix shift towards subscription. I think you said 57% versus 34% in the year ago quarter, and then 50% last quarter, because, obviously, we're seeing that shift there. But if I look at just the revenue numbers that you're putting up as well, continued strength there, even just with the shift towards more ratable numbers that showed up on the balance sheet, unbilled. So, I guess, the question is, if you look at the past few quarters here, what sort of, I guess, is driving that overall strength and reacceleration in the Workspace Services business? Is it going back to some of these big customers you have engaged with a while? Like the example you gave, and sort of, I guess, catching up on demand there, just any sort of color on what's driving that reacceleration would be great.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Phil. It's David. So, couple things. Overall Workspace bookings on an ACD basis are up double digits this year. So we've seen the underlying business dynamics really, really move up. And what's driving that is a combination of a couple of things. For those customers that are focused on virtualization and VDI, that side of the house, we just continue to develop against our underlying strengths, the best performance, the best security, the best manageability. So all that is continuing to move forward. Citrix Cloud is the real driver though. I mean, and that just allows for even traditional on-premises customers to have a number of services that help optimize the underlying infrastructure, provide health checks, just give them much more flexibility, much more simplification, and then the ability to stay current and adopt our new innovation.","The bigger strategic direction though is, as we talk about the future of work and we talk about the Workspace, and everything that that's going to be able to address, we're unlocking non-virtualization use cases. You'll hear me talk a lot about general purpose. And what that means is really the idea of creating more of a general purpose Workspace platform that is now applicable to every user in every enterprise, regardless of whether you need virtualization or not, because of new capabilities to deliver security to SaaS, or security to mobile apps and really provide an integrated experience across any device. So it's that broader \u2013 the overall broader strategy and articulation that's really helping uptick the market overall.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And then just one follow-up to that. I mean, obviously, in Q2 you had substantial big wins, but just million dollar, and the mega-sized wins. This quarter seemed to be a bit broader in terms of where the strength came from. Just wondering if you could give us some color on sort of what you're seeing on sort of the big deal front, particularly in terms of pipeline, as well as just the sort of the breadth, I guess, the strength that seems to be coming back as well. Thanks.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Big deals in general were good. They're down a little bit sequentially from Q2 to Q3. It's always our seasonally weakest quarter and our most back-end loaded quarter, so that's nothing unexpected there. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a record number of large deals coming out of Q4, really across all geos and all enterprises. You saw in the reported numbers, we've got good balance across the three geos right now. So it's not really concentrated. It's just general strength.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Turits. Excuse me, Michael, your line is open.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Sorry, I was on mute there. Question for you, David. I just wanted to get a better sense on net scale in the SD-WAN space and kind of what the traction has been like, and then in particular who you're going up against. Is it Cisco and VMWare mainly?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I talked a little bit about Networking overall in my prepared comments. SD-WAN, it's a pretty crowded market space right now. It's fairly nascent, so it's not moving the needle too much. And therefore, the growth rates are large, but it's off a small base. What we're focused on there is a couple things: Optimizing the Workspace, where we can just continue to help with delivery to branches, optimizing the HDX traffic. And more things that we're doing fairly recently though haven't really impacted the numbers yet. With Microsoft or on the Virtual WAN, optimizing O 365, providing solutions for MSPs, a number of those are really future investments. So I'd say stay tuned on the SD-WAN piece. It's a little bit more of a future at this point.","Going back to the big business on the rest of Networking, it's really a tale of two segments, more than anything else. The SSP segment, as everyone knows, is highly concentrated and therefore is always really volatile quarter-to-quarter. Q3 was one of those quarters that was \u2013 it was down pretty sharply. It was actually down about 20% year-on-year, when I looked at underlying bookings, represented just 21% of the overall mix versus the enterprise which was up about low double digits in terms of demand. So that's been a function of our strategy though as well. We knew that the SSPs have been concentrated for a long time. So we've been investing much more broadly around expanding capacity in the enterprise, making sure that we have a really strong story around hybrid, multi-cloud; the ability to really be flexible with licensing across physical and virtual environments; a number of those initiatives that we've talked about many times.","So, I would say competitively, the landscape hasn't changed too much. It's a lot of F5 in the traditional ADC category. And then a number of vendors, when you talk about emerging markets, like SD-WAN.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And then one other thing that I want to touch upon, just as you increase that mix shift to subscription, just any update you can provide on the channel and the go-to-market strategy there would be great.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, the overall strategy doesn't change that much. I mean, we've obviously been going through a lot of work with our channel to really help them understand where we want the channel focused in a, let's call it, the cloud-first world, as you look forward to a number of years. So I'd say channels in transition, in a lot of ways. Those partners that have made the transition towards being CSPs and really embracing subscription and Citrix Cloud are doing extremely well. They have \u2013 I've heard reported growth rates that are \u2013 they're much, much stronger than even our overall business. Those partners, however, that are more historically focused and oriented towards renewing maintenance agreements, that's more of a challenging transition. We've certainly put the incentives behind the strategic direction of the company, and we're going to keep pushing there over the next couple of years. We are doing more direct touch, as you'd imagine, as we sell more cloud services. And we have been continuing to build out our direct go-to-market now for a few years. And so you'll see us continue to do that as well.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow.","David Rainville - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, this is actually David, on for Raimo. First, thanks for clarifying the subscription revenue bookings (27:23) just quoted us. That makes sense. Maybe more of a high-level question first for David. Since the Microsoft announcement about entering the Desktop-as-a-Service market, I'm curious to see what you heard from customers so far. And maybe longer term, how do you see that relationship with Microsoft evolving?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. The relationship with Microsoft, overall, continues to be great. Yeah. I mean, we do so many things across Azure, across Citrix Cloud, across interoperability, whether it's on the Networking side, on the Mobility side, and then obviously on the Workspace side. So, as Microsoft continues to evolve their platforms, it used to be called RDS, now it's Azure Remote Desktop. We'll continue to build on top of those platforms and just extend the service for customers.","The thing that we announced, however, just at Microsoft Ignite, was two important points. One was, we'll effectively become a Microsoft CSP in some dimensions. And really what that means is that we can now provide more turnkey complete solutions, bundling in Microsoft capabilities along with Citrix native data service built on top of Azure. We haven't announced exactly when that product is going to be GA, so stay tuned for that as well. But it's just a continuation of the relationship we've had for a couple of decades now. Feedback from customers has been, love to see it, anxious to get our hands on it. And that's pretty much where we are. We'll, of course, be doing that on a white glove basis over the next quarter or so, and then talk much more about GA as we go forward.","David Rainville - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes sense. And maybe, if I may, a quick follow-up on the transition. In the previous calls, you mentioned that the first half of 2018 would be focused more on net new customers or net new white space for Citrix Cloud and subscription, and that TTU motions would kick in in the second half of the year. Just curious what you're trending here, and what kind of the split between net new customers versus existing base you've seen this quarter?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. TTU continues to be a small minority overall number, and that's by design. And so, if you step back and think about it strategically, we wanted to make sure that we're generating a lot of momentum in net new accounts and net new use cases. It may be an existing customer, but just outside of what I would consider their traditional virtualization of one. So that's how you should think about where we've had the focus.","Now, as we go forward though, I mean, TTU is Trading-Up and Transition, is what the acronym stands for. Combination of helping those customers today that have a virtual deployment operate it much more efficiently, and give them the ease to adopt hybrid cloud in their own environment, but also start to expand into much more of these general purpose capabilities that I talked about before. So that'll be a bit more gradual motion. And we'll start to ramp that in Q4, and then, of course, into next year.","David Rainville - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from Nikolay Beliov.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. David, you spent some time talking to customers. What are you hearing, in terms of the microenvironment, emerging economies, Brexit, Italy, all the moving pieces globally going on? What's the customer sentiment?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Nikolay, I'd say, overall, the general environment's pretty good still. I mean, there's a little bit of noise out there. We've seen a bit of volatility in the last couple of weeks. But in general, the underlying demand drivers for most people remain strong. And so therefore that translates into pretty good spending environment. Of course, there's discussions going on about midterm elections, interest rates, Brexit, and all the normal things, but I think people are taking them in stride. And we haven't seen a material change in the demand environment.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And Drew, just wanted to get a sense for, did you say the unbilled\/DR for 3Q was $140 million or $240 million?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Unbilled for Q3 was $243 million.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","$243 million. What was it last year, same quarter?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","$216 million, roughly.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","No, that was last quarter.","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Oh, I'm sorry, yeah, I'm off. It's 50 \u2013 yeah, looking through our call here, $57 million.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. You provide in the supplemental numbers last quarter different numbers, so I guess we can go from this offline. But going forward, how do you expect \u2013 talk to us about the seasonality of unbilled\/DR. Is Q4 going to be the highest and then it tapers down in Q1 and starts building up in 2019? I think that's important for us to help us model subscription revenues using the waterfall.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Nikolay, let me jump in there, because I don't think we have talked about the duration of unbilled revenue yet. We'll start \u2013 we'll provide \u2013 cause that's the one piece you just need to really triangulate what you're getting at. So, unbilled, just to remind everybody, our typical cloud contract is three years TCV with annual billings. So we'll bill that first one upfront and the other two go into unbilled. And, as Drew said, unbilled is nearly $250 million right now, versus $50 million a year ago. So, I mean, we've had a huge increase in unbilled as we've been driving this transition. So you really should look at that in concert with the actual deferred revenue numbers as well.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes.","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","As the mix increases, it continues to increase. That's how to think about it. It follows the mix. The mix (33:04)...","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. And going back to my question about the seasonality, is Q4 going to be the big in unbilled\/DR and then is going to taper down in Q1 and build out throughout the rest of 2019?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Nikolay, we're not in a position where we're going to give a lot of forward guidance on unbilled at this point in time. So we'll talk about it coming out of Q4, and much more seasonality. We've got four quarters of actuals right now, and they've all been pretty strong growth. The strongest of the year, of course, was Q2 this year. We just had a blowout quarter last quarter, and so we wanted to get a little bit more history under our belt before we start forecasting some of these off balance sheet items.","Nikolay Beliov - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, Thank you, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Heather Bellini.","Mark Grant - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Mark Grant, on for Heather. Just a couple of quick ones for me. Drew, given the revenue and the earnings forecast for next year, and I know we're going to get a lot more detail on this on 4Q, but can you give us a sense of how you're feeling about free cash flow next year, and then any potential updates on churn metrics given the subscription transition?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure. Well, it's still \u2013 we're still in the middle of \u2013 we're early in Q4. So we're still early in the planning process. And \u2013 so the first \u2013 in terms of operating cash flow, you can see that it's clearly going \u2013 yeah, it's clearly following the revenue, right? As we continue to build the mix up, as the revenue goes up, it's going to follow that; and obviously the other dimension is, as we expand margin, then that just falls to the bottom line. So I think you can get a sense for how we guide in terms of the 4% revenue growth, and about $6 a share in EPS should give you some level of guidance, and that should pop some number out of the bottom.","Right now, operating cash flow for the quarter was up 18% year-on-year, that's operating cash flow. And then, again, we've seen a nice uptick kind of following this trend of the revenue being up along with the margin expansion, where we're now, roughly, I think, through Q3, trailing 12 months, about little more than $7.50 per share on a free cash flow per share basis. And so we can \u2013 we obviously expect that that should continue to go up as we move towards our 2020 targets \u2013 progress against those targets.","Mark Grant - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then, any update on the churn metrics?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","No. Nothing new there.","Mark Grant - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Keith Weiss.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. Thank you for taking the question, and congrats on the strong results this quarter. I was \u2013 (36:00) I wanted to do a little bit of a status check relative to some of the initial milestones you laid out last year, in terms of your 2020 targets. You talked about hitting, I think you said, 50% to 55% of subscription bookings mix in 2019. Does that sort of put on you on track in terms of your overall 2020 goals, when it comes to subscription ratable mix, as well as top line growth? Would you say that you guys are sort of tracking to plan or ahead of plan relative to the framework you introduced last year?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","No, we're well ahead of plan versus the plan that we laid out. In fact, if we were to look at it on a revenue basis, we'll exit this year, based on current guidance, better part of $100 million ahead of plan. Cash flow, as Drew just pointed out, cash flow from ops per share is already at $7.60 or so, trailing 12 months. So I'd say we're executing very well. We are going to exit this year at about 40% mix, up from mid-twenties last year, mix of subscription versus perpetual bookings. And we'll continue to drive that next year. If we can get up north of 55% while it's still a couple of hundred basis point headwind to revenue growth, that's well on the way to our overall goals. I think it's fair that after we exit this year, we'll come back, and going into 2019, update our multi-year goals just once we close out the full year. I think it's a good time to do it.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That makes sense. And then, just one quick follow-up. The perpetual license business has been stronger than certainly we have expected the last couple of quarters. Any sort of comments that you have on what's driving that strength for the license business, given that you've seen some weakness from the cloud service providers in NetScaler. So, are we seeing more sort of on-prem Workspace deployments than maybe you guys have initially expected? Any sort of color there would be helpful.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say it's two things, not just cloud service providers, but we had strength in NetScaler Enterprise, and so that part of the business is largely perpetual license, and that's the primary driver there. Workspace, it's \u2013 it was well over half subscription these days. But since the overall business is growing so nicely, that means perpetual is growing at the same time. So I'd say it's basically just moving from strength to strength.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Walter Pritchard.","Drew Foster - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. This is Drew Foster, on for Walter. Thanks for taking the question. You've seen some good progress in terms of large Citrix Cloud deals booked so far this year. And I'm curious to what extent those wins are serving as references to other customers in your pipeline. Thanks.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, as you'd imagine, big cloud customers always want to talk to other ones. So we'll \u2013 on the public references, we'll talk about publicly, but most of them are private. So we'll connect CIO to CIO. The top 10 deals for cloud in Q3 were all over $1 million each.","Drew Foster - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then, just trying to get a better idea of the CSP business in terms of scale. How does that compare in scale relative to the larger Citrix Cloud business?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I'm sorry, did you say the SSP business?","Drew Foster - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","CSP. Yeah, CSP, sorry.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","CSP business. Yeah, CSP is a minority now. I think CSP business runs $120 million a year, roughly. Is that right, Drew?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","That's right.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, versus the overall number.","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","So call it maybe a quarter of the subscription business.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah.","Drew Foster - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kirk Materne.","Peter Levine - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Peter Levine, in for Kirk. Thanks again for taking my questions. I just have one here. Your initial guide for 2019, you talked about capacity and infrastructure investments in 2019. Can you kind of provide a little more color on what those investments will look like? And then, the second part to that is, in the second half of 2018 versus the first half of 2018, I think your capacity, your head count was somewhat flat. Can you talk about new heads you're bringing on and how do you plan on deploying? Is it geography product-based? And how that would look in 2019 as well. Thanks.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. As Drew pointed out, we're investing in capacity and the infrastructure needed to ramp our cloud services. So you can think about that in three big buckets. Capacity, quarter carry, and customer-facing people, that will be across the globe. As we see opportunity, we'll continue to invest there. Second area would be around customer success. Those folks will be more responsible for picking up a customer after the initial sale, making sure that they're doing the correct level of enablement, ramping new services, et cetera. Just really making sure they're successful. That will ramp up. And then, the third is around just cloud operations, the difficult things to manage the cloud. These are already big teams, but I'm sure we'll continue to invest behind that. The one area that we didn't really talk or you didn't ask about is around innovation. That's been a combination of both remixing the types of skills that we've had. We've had a lot of that going on over the course of the last year, but also we're continuing to invest in innovation capacity as you see R&D start to tick up a little bit as well. So, those types of things, we'll continue to do into 2019.","Operator, any further questions?","Operator","There are no more questions in cue.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We'll talk to you again in three months.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Fleites, you may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites","Thank you, Jared. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's first quarter 2013 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be Mark Templeton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Henshall, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast from Citrix Systems' Investor Relations website. The webcast will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product grouping to our Investor Relations website.","I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.

A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I'd like to turn it over to David Henshall, our Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Financial Officer. David?","David James Henshall","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As you can see from the release, Q1 results included $673 million in total revenue, up 14%; 25% year-on-year growth in deferred revenue; $249 million in flow from ops; and adjusted EPS of $0.62 a share.","In Q1, we closed 41 transactions greater than $1 million each with relative strength coming from businesses in the technology, healthcare and financial services sectors. Strategically important to us is the fact that more than 25% of these orders included multiple products, continuing to demonstrate the value that customers see in the integrated solutions that we can deliver.","Geographically, Q1 demand patterns were uneven across all of our markets with business in the Americas geo generally solid throughout the quarter, leading to revenue growth of 17% from last year. However, internationally, performance at the regional level was impacted by a number of different market forces resulted in delays in closing identified opportunities. In total, EMEA posted a revenue increase of 9%, while Pacific and Japan region was up 15% from a year ago.","So now let's look at the Q1 results within our 3 primary businesses. First, our Desktop & Mobile business grew 5% from last year to $358 million. Included in this number was a 13% decline in new license revenue, albeit off a strong quarter a year ago. In Q1, we began expanding the focus of this business to give CIOs the solutions to enable mobile work styles, mobilizing apps, data, desktops and people. The addition of our new XenMobile product line will help customers embrace mobility, drive through business value and leverage our base as they bridge the worlds between Windows and mobility. Since XenMobile was just launched, the financial impact was immaterial for the period. But given the early results and rapid growth in pipeline, we're on track to achieve our full year goals.","For context on the overall Mobile & Desktop business, there are a few metrics I think really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we continue to see from customers. In Q1, there were $22 million-plus transactions for the Mobile & Desktop products, representing customers in technology, healthcare, financial services, education and other verticals. In total, more than 2,800 unique customers purchased XenDesktop, including more than 100 transactions for more than 1,000 seats each, 25 orders greater than 5,000 seats and 14 that were over 10,000 seats. And finally, over $20 million of the sequential increase in deferred revenue was related to XenDesktop and XenMobile.","Examples of how customers are utilizing these technologies as a way to accelerate their business imperatives included a public school system initiating a multimillion dollar BYO project that leverages XenDesktop and NetScaler products alongside those technologies from our partners, Microsoft and Cisco, to build an overall best-in-class solution. Or a retail chain, expanding the XenDesktop deployment for in-store use, while initiating XenMobile and NetScaler to also deliver secure mobile access to their line of business apps, mail and Internet, or a global pharmaceuticals company leveraging XenApp, XenMobile and ShareFile in a project that included moving 2,000 field sales reps off of laptops and onto iPads as their primary device with a goal of cost savings and greater mobility.","We're increasingly talking to customers about business enablement, reducing the cost of their app and desktop infrastructure and increasing productivity by enabling enterprise mobility options.","Next, in our networking and cloud business, total revenue increased by 47% in the quarter to $147 million with product license revenue increasing 50% from last year. The NetScaler family was again the major driver of growth in the quarter, and we continue to execute against the strategies to leverage NetScaler as part of delivering integrated solutions to customers, as well as broadening go-to-market coverage.","For example, in our enterprise accounts, the cross-sell and attach motions drove over 480 desktop orders during Q1 that included NetScaler as part of the solution. Our NetScaler VPX appliances were up 63% year-on-year, contributing about 5% of NetScaler license revenue. And the NetScaler SDX platform, designed to enable full multi-tenancy and consolidation within the virtual data center, continues to gain momentum with both service providers and large enterprise, growing up over 70% from last year and representing nearly 20% of NetScaler license.","SDX, which runs over 40 independent NetScaler instances on a single appliance, is also open for third-party vendors, giving customers the flexibility to bring together best-in-class networking services in a single consolidated footprint. And finally, in this business, Bytemobile solutions contributed just a few million dollars of product revenue in Q1. We remain confident in the outlook for the full year, but as we've discussed previously a few times, the timing of closing large engagements, as well as the specific contract terms of those deals will cause a recognition of revenue to be uneven throughout the year.","So next, within our Collaboration & Sharing business, SaaS revenue was up 14% to $138 million and the GoToMeeting family continues to be the primary driver here, earning 22% in Q1. And ShareFile, our data sharing service and platform, is also ramping nicely, up more than 75% from the first quarter last year.","So turning to operations. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 87%, down about 1.5 from a year ago, and the driver behind this is simply the mix of revenue, as we've been very successful growing our networking and SaaS businesses. We expect this trend to continue over the next few quarters, leading to adjusted gross margin for the full year of between 86% and 87%.","During Q1, we added 258 new people to Citrix, including roughly 160 that joined the company through the acquisition of Zenprise. The other additions were focused on expanding go-to-market reach and customer direct touch, primarily around networking, where we're still capacity-constrained in a number of different markets, as well as just overall growth in our data sharing dream.","So finally, the adjusted tax rate, 14.2% in the quarter, down from 22% last year, reflecting the anticipated impact of reinstating the 2012 federal R&D tax credit.","Looking at the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter, with a decrease from Q4 coming from the funding of the Zenprise acquisition and the repurchase of 1.2 million shares of stock, offset by nearly $250 million in cash flow from operations. Also, deferred revenue, as I mentioned earlier, increased to over $1.2 billion in Q1, growing $33 million sequentially and up over 25% from a year ago. Importantly in there is long-term deferred balance, which increased 53%, reflecting the continued evolution in customer engagements to a more strategic level, which more often include multiyear commitments that are going to be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.","So turning to our current outlook and expectations for 2013. Overall, we executed well in Q1 within the context of an uneven environment for technology spending. And though it's reasonable to expect the demand levels to remain mixed across geographic regions, our pipeline growth, new POCs and customer activity metrics have remained very strong. We're very confident in our core business strategies and in the investments we're making in the enterprise mobility, data sharing and networking. We'll continue to focus on delivering financial results while investing to expand our long-term capacity and differentiation across these areas.","So for the full year 2013, we're maintaining our expectations for total revenue, while slightly adjusting EPS due to the expected mix of revenue and lower interest and other income. So total expectations are now total revenue in the range of $2.95 billion to $2.98 billion. Adjusted gross margin between 86% and 87%, other income of approximately $4 million and adjusted tax rate between 21% and 22% and adjusted EPS between $3.08 and $3.11 a share. For the second quarter 2013, we currently expect total revenue in the range of $705 million to $715 million, other income of approximately $1 million, adjusted tax rate of 22% to 23% and adjusted EPS of $0.62 to $0.63 per share.","Before I turn it over to Mark to discuss our ongoing businesses, I'd like to invite all of you to attend our financial analyst meeting being held on the 22nd of May during our Annual Synergy Conference. Please reach out to our Investor Relations team for information on how to register for this event. Mark?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. We executed well in Q1 despite uncertainties in the overall IT market. While macro headwinds pushed some larger desktop deals out of the quarter, we're entering Q2 with great enthusiasm about our market position and growth prospects. The performance of our new mobile platforms business was especially encouraging, growing the demand pipeline faster than expected. And I was extremely pleased to see another solid quarter of overperformance in cloud networking, where we continue to take share in both enterprise and provider markets. We also saw a continued growth in our Web collaboration and data sharing services, key cloud-based businesses that will play an increasingly important role in our mobile work style strategy.","Looking forward, we really like the macro trends fueling our business. Work is no longer a place. Meetings are mobile. And desktops, once considered devices, are increasingly delivered as services from the cloud, giving employees easy secure access to apps and data from any laptop, smartphone or tablet.","The dynamics of IT are also changing. Simplicity is disrupting complexity. The focus on building and operating computing systems is rapidly shifting to aggregating and delivering services from a wide range of sources. And no matter where those services are coming from, they require a new generation of networking that delivers far more intelligent app layer security, visibility and performance. These forces are driving demand across our 3 major businesses and growing our estimated total available market to $16 billion by 2015.","Next, I'd like to address each of these market opportunities, beginning with Mobile & Desktop. Our Mobile & Desktop business had a strong finish last year. In Q1, we quickly integrated the Zenprise team and launched an exciting new product, Citrix XenMobile with an overall strategy to lead  enterprise mobility with completeness of vision, technology and product offerings. We're offering the 6 core components for delivering enterprise mobility: first, mobile device configuration and security; second, secure mobile email and Internet; third, native mobile app delivery and control; fourth, mobile content delivery and sharing with ShareFile; fifth, secured mobile collaboration with GoToMeeting; and of course, sixth, the mobilization of Windows apps and desktops through XenDesktop and XenApp.","Beginning in Q1, major Citrix partners, including HP, CSC, Atos and Fujitsu began rolling out new solutions based on Citrix XenMobile, increasing our market reach in the fast-emerging enterprise mobility space. Customers around the world are going mobile. As they do, they have a clear choice, deploy a myriad of point products for multiple vendors or standardize on a consolidated solution from Citrix. By definition, this drives multiproduct deals, significant competitive advantage and we think, growth. A key aspect of winning these mobility deals is our integration with XenDesktop and XenApp, leveraging the inherent mobility value proposition of desktop virtualization. The mobile here is shifting the lens through which customers see desktop virtualization of basic cost savings to part of a broader enterprise mobility strategy. The business case happens to be quite compelling. Virtual apps and desktops are mobile by definition. They're the fastest path to mobile ROI because making your existing Windows available on any device with XenApp and XenDesktop gets you there. Virtual apps are secure by design, giving end users the freedom to use any mix of devices while keeping sensitive company information secure at all times. Virtual apps are economical by extending the life of end points, reducing the cost of administration and speeding the provisioning of apps to new users and devices.","While hard to quantify, we're casting desktop virtualization in this broader context, the context of enterprise mobility contributed to the delay of some Q1 desktop deals. Some customers and partners thought to consider the combined value of XenDesktop and XenMobile. While this created some downward pressure on Q1, we believe the overall strategic impact for Citrix will be a clear net positive. The combination is a differentiator for both product lines. And the total value proposition will only get stronger as we deliver more native mobile and cloud technology with Project Avalon. We'll have a lot more to say about that next month at Synergy. So stay tuned. So we like our position in mobile and desktops to deliver a complete enterprise mobility solution across devices, apps and data to leverage our base as they bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility. And to do it all with a beautiful consumer-like experience that sets Citrix apart.","Next, I'd like to talk about our collaboration and data sharing business. Our focus on mobile collaboration has been a clear success with the percentage of mobile attendees in GoToMeeting increasing 2x over the past year. We're also continuing to drive innovation across the product family, including the addition of HD video in GoToWebinar and HD video in GoToTraining. In addition, we just launched a brand new webcast product announced last week. So from small group meetings and classrooms to auditorium-filled seminars, we're extending our reach and competitive position in collaboration.","Our mobile work style strategy is also driving growth in our ShareFile business, enabling secure data sharing across people and devices as a key component for BYO and mobility initiatives. In Q1, Gartner gave ShareFile their highest possible rating, highlighting our strong track record with regulated and security-conscious customer segments. Enterprise was the fastest-growing ShareFile segment in Q1 as customers embrace additional IT policy struggles[ph] and security enhancements to our mobile tools, as well as the recent release of our StorageZones technology. ShareFile with StorageZones let the enterprise customers choose where to store data based on their security, compliance and performance requirements. The nature of work is changing, becoming less about location and more about how effectively you work, making collaboration and data sharing increasingly important to all customer segments.","Finally, I'd like to turn to our networking and cloud business. As David noted, the strongest performance of the quarter came from NetScaler. 3 drivers are fueling growth: first, the build out of public and private clouds; second, growing demand for mobile workforce security; and third, the rise of next-generation services like video, rich media and big data. These powerful market forces require an entirely new approach to networking that goes well beyond the capabilities of traditional solutions and plays perfectly to our competitive advantages.","Customers who choose NetScaler in head-to-head competition increasingly cite our superior architecture, better price performance and innovative technologies like Pay-Grow that let them buy only the capacity they need and scale up seamlessly as their demand increases. Q1 also saw the debut of the NetScaler integration with XenMobile, giving us the only enterprise mobility solution with built-in controls for network security and performance. A highlight of the quarter was the higher tax rate of NetScaler as part of the XenMobile solution. This combination gives XenMobile a significant advantage over stand-alone MDM players, and the growth of XenMobile will further accelerate our NetScaler business.","Mobile is also driving networking revenue on the telco side through our new Bytemobile product line. The combination of NetScaler and Bytemobile gives mobile operators a powerful consolidated solution for optimizing video traffic on their 3G and LTE networks. So once again, product integrations are differentiating our solution, giving customers greater value. And we're seeing promising traction from the networking partnership we announced with Cisco in Q4 of last year. This relationship, building on our strong existing partnership in desktop virtualization, is driving new opportunities as Cisco recommends NetScaler for customers who need more advanced app delivery network services.","I'm really pleased with our execution in cloud networking through product integrations, go-to-market investment and fundamental technical innovation. Consumer innovation is driving the shift from the PC as the singular platform for work to a vast array of devices, apps and data. More than ever, IT decision-making is being shaped by the forces of BYO, personal cloud services and a millennial generation with new ideas about where, when and how work is done. We're feeling confident in our strategy to provide powerful cloud infrastructure that enables mobile work styles helping our customers embrace rapid change in the workforce, in the workplace and in how services are delivered. The macroeconomic environment hasn't changed our view of the market opportunity. We're going into Q2 in the second half of the year with confidence in our strategy, execution and competitive position.","And now I'd like to open it up for questions. Jared?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted some more color on your commentary about some pushouts on some desktop deals from Q1 and just kind of how you expect to see these come back online over the course of the year, and if there are any particular sort of drivers with that? And then also, I wonder if you could also just give a little more color on how you think actually the acquisition of Zenprise in putting XenMobile MDM together with CloudGateway as -- just sort of affected clients in their sort of perception of your mobile offerings.","David James Henshall","Sure, Phil. It's David. Let me take the first part of that and then ask Mark to contribute. Overall, as we talked about, and then -- I'd say there was a fairly uneven environment in a lot of markets around the globe. And obviously, the desktop virtualization business tends to be the most volatile for a couple of reasons. One of those is the fact that it is still a very powerful set of technologies, which lends itself to a level of complexity. So the businesses are driving strong ROI and the business value out of the deployments tend to be larger more mature organizations. So a lot of the focus from a product development standpoint this year is in the set of Avalon technologies we've talked about a couple of times over the last few quarters really focused on bringing down some of those barriers to adoption, making it easier for customers to acquire scale and manage virtualization on a broad basis, and those we'll be rolling out later in the year. As far as the individual transactions, yes, I would agree there is definitely some level of, let's call it, distraction that came out from rolling out of the XenMobile business as customers do tend to think about enterprise mobility as everything from the individual device all the way up through being able to mobilize their line of business applications, core Windows, et cetera. And so bringing that together has caused a tremendous amount of interest from customers and the teams are driving lots of proof of concepts, lots of conversations around where we're going with that. So as Mark described, we're very excited about the overall level of pipeline built in this area. Some individual transactions, they are just being influenced by the macro. There are certain transactions that closed this quarter already, for example, that came out of Q1. I think I described the overall environment as one where it felt like CIOs were absorbing Q4 purchases, kind of laying out budgets and plans for the year. So overall, vibrancy was not really strong. But overall, we feel very good about the level of total pipeline. And as we look into Q2, expect to see the Mobile & Desktop business actually up in the, let's call it, double -- low-double digits from a new license standpoint.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then on the mobile side?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Phil, the response and reaction from partners and customers has been -- actually exceeded our expectations in terms of the value they see in integrating the Zenprise technology and the CloudGateway technology. Obviously, we're going to have some more announcements at Synergy next month. But if you think about it, we closed the deal on January 2. In 45 days, we released XenMobile MDM addition. We trained our field teams and partners and began to fire up a lot of POCs that included both XenMobile MDM as well as CloudGateway and built the pipeline, doubled the expectation that we had in the quarter. Our partners and field team's very, very excited and see this as an opportunity to actually sell a more strategic deal to a customer and to reinforce the value of desktop virtualization around mobility, around security and economics. And they're seeing this as a major, major inflection point, I think, and really having a conversation with customers that -- about business impact as opposed to a technology solution. So that's what we saw in the quarter, and we're being very aggressive about it as you can tell. And by the way, in the quarter, we also had HP, CSC, Atos and other partners step up and either commit to or actually release solutions based on XenMobile and MDM addition as well as CloudGateway technologies. So great quarter for this motion we have toward bringing mobile and desktop together in a marketplace that we think is emerging really quickly and that we have an incredible set of assets and that leverages our base and what we've stood for, as a company, since the beginning and all the great opportunities ahead.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to focus on the online services group here, the SaaS group, which seem to have a step-down in growth rate there. If I look at it even sequentially and I back out maybe ShareFile, it feels like it was flattish to down, sort of just any color on what's going on there and is it sort of a competitive thing because that business has been a pretty steady Eddie grower for you, and it seems to have ticked down quite a bit and obviously, impacting margins.","David James Henshall","Sure, Bhavan. It's David again. The overall SaaS business for just everyone, it's made up of 4 major pieces. The major strategic focus areas are collaboration and data sharing, both of which that I talked about earlier. Collaboration is up north of 20%. Data sharing, albeit off a small base, is up north of 75%. So both of those are growing very, very rapidly. The other line items in there are IT services and remote access. Remote access is the business. It's actually declining year-on-year. It's just a very mature highly fragmented market. The product there is GoToMyPC. Still a very important part of our business, but one that just the market has  matured. So I'd say there is also some level of impact from the environment that we did see in Q1. We saw that a little bit on new sales into the enterprise and also in renewal rates in the enterprise as well. So there's some changes going on internally that we're working through whether it's program and process, items in the sales organization. So expect a few of those things to bounce back in Q2. And for the full year, our SaaS businesses ought to grow in -- our guidance would point to a range up 1 or 2 percentage points from what we saw in Q1.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then when you look at ShareFile and StorageZones, just help us understand, there's a part of it that's SaaS, but do you charge for a portion of that as license, and where does that fit in, in the segment structure?","David James Henshall","Sure. The vast majority of revenue related to ShareFile will be in SaaS -- will be in the SaaS line. There will occasionally be some that is on prem may show up in product license but that would be a small minority.","Operator","And your next question comes from Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","I heard on Phil's question, I think you hinted about some shift in sale cycles due to the combination of mobility and desktops. How are they shifting and when do you think they would normalize? And Mark, if you could talk a little bit about the mobile applications in terms of is the product ready for the market and where are we in terms of getting the channel and sales force ready to ramp it up?","Mark B. Templeton","I think the sales cycle point would be more one of having a longer cycle with customers that wanted -- that are looking at desktop virtualization and the value proposition of XenApp and XenDesktop more as part of a mobility solution. We don't see any change in sales cycles in the customers that are looking at XenApp and XenDesktop for desktop replacement or for deployment of apps like ERP, CRM, medical record apps, imaging apps. We don't see any changes in those sales cycle coming. But more in the largest strategic sale cycles, we'll see a little bit of lengthening certainly as we get people trained in our own field, as well as our partners and certainly, as we make some additional announcements and enhancements to the products that actually integrate them better, so they're actually simpler to implement and even more powerful in how they're integrated. That will be a key topic at Synergy. In terms of the mobile apps, I'm not sure what your question is about. Maybe you should reframe that for me.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Yes. I just want to know is the product fully there where it needs to be for customer adoption? And when do you think you'll have the whole channel and sales force fully ramped up to sell that product?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, we'll have a lot to say about that at Synergy. I'd say that right now the way the product is packaged is, their XenMobile MDM addition, it's ready for market, customers are buying and implementing it. We have over 1 million devices under management through the XenMobile MDM. So it's ready. CloudGateway has a base of customers. It's ready as well. And in Q1, we actually created something called a mobile solutions bundle that made it easy for customers to buy both of them together. And one of the big things that we'll do is make that bundle and how these products interoperate and are integrated much smoother and more powerful so that we'll gain momentum there with, not only with the customer base, with the partner base. So this will be a several step sort of process through the year that will have milestones around product releases and announcements that we don't want to preannounce here. But we feel really good about the roadmap, the strategy and how we're executing on it from the inside pointing out toward the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Clarify that David's to Phil's first question that you're looking for license revenue in the desktop solution and mobile to be up double digit -- low double digits in the second quarter. And then just can you confirm that? And then number two, you had originally, David, said, for the full year, you had hoped that license in that division might be up mid-single digits. Is there any update to that earlier comment?","David James Henshall","Yes, Steve. What I said about Q2 is correct. I do expect that year-on-year growth in product license for the mobile and desktop business will be up low-double digits in Q2, and that's a function of what we've talked about already on the call about specific transactions that they may have split by pipeline, pipeline coverage, as well as starting to get contribution from the XenMobile business. So that's what's driving Q2. I think given the performance in Q1, the full year right now probably goes from mid-single digits to low-single digits would be the expectation embedded in our guidance. And that's just a function of what we saw in Q1 right now. No change in the overall optimism of the business or the outlook, just a simple math exercise. Offsetting that, of course, is just the outstanding performance that's coming out of our cloud and networking business. And we talked about that a lot with that going up 50% year-on-year. So expect that to contribute about, let's call it, high 20s to as much as 30% growth year-on-year in product license. And so our total product for the full fiscal year '13 should be up in the","[Audio Gap]","low-double digits between 12%, 13% roughly in line with where we had laid out last quarter but just a slight change in the overall mix of revenue.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Very helpful. And then on the data center and networking business, you mentioned that Bytemobile revenue was just a few million dollars. I wonder if we could maybe  get a better quantification of what exactly that might have been. And I think what we're all just trying to dig for is what the organic license growth would have been in that networking business, and if you have a comment on that?","David James Henshall","Yes. Sure, Steve. Yes, it actually was just a few million dollars of product license, and that's a business that for the last couple of quarters we've talked about being very uneven simply due to the timing of large deals, and they tend to be large -- low volume of large transactions. And therefore, the timing of those specific ones could hit one quarter versus the other. And then on a contract-by-contract basis, there tends to be some unique terms such as the case in Q1 where orders were actually booked but are going to be recognized later in the year as we meet certain deliverables. So still on track from a Byte business to contribute the $50 million guidance number that we had put out there in 2013, still feel very good about that. But the expectation should be that it will be a bit lumpy. In terms of the other line items inside of our networking and cloud business, the NetScaler family was the big standout. NetScaler stand-alone product license was up north of 60% year-on-year and really being driven by a lot of the factors that we talked about, are doing very, very well on cross-sell and attach motions. As we drive more into the enterprise, we continue to do very, very well with the build-out of Internet-centric and cloud service providers. We are expanding the breadth of the product solution with the virtual appliances to allow people that level of flexibility on both from a fabric point of view, cloud and other applications. And then on the SDX side, just the economic benefits of consolidation, married with the power and flexibility of being able to consolidate multiple different network services onto a single platform is just resonating very well with customers. So you put all those together with the fact that we're still capacity-constrained in a number of markets, and we're optimistic about that business. I wouldn't expect this level of growth to continue, of course, as the numbers get larger, but it is one of our primary investments as we look into the balance of the year, to be able to add capacity so that we can actually service customers and all the GOs that are underrepresented right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Looks like the networking business is doing really superb, so I don't have any question there. And pardon my stream of consciousness, with respect to the XenDesktop deals, the market, is it fair to characterize these deals as being just put in a bit of a suspension or have they been frozen or the customers have canceled projects? And can you just give us a little bit more color as to what confidence level you have on the deals that have slipped? And also, if you could talk to how the linearity of the quarter progressed? I mean, did you see a pause just ahead of sequester and things. Did that things bounced back a little bit in March but maybe not quick enough to offset the weakness you probably saw at the beginning part of the quarter. And last -- sorry again, if you don't have the time, that's okay. We don't need to answer this question. Any current thoughts on where do we stand with the ROI of desktop virtualization?","Mark B. Templeton","Kash, thanks for the question. So first, there were no competitive changes in Q1 vis-\u00e0-vis desktop virtualization. Basically, the forces that move things outward to. First, our sequester, and we have lots of external forces of sequester, what was happening in Europe and as David mentioned, most of the impact was on the international front. And then the second piece was some pause with some more strategic customers, which would be larger engagements to consider the value proposition of XenMobile with XenDesktop. So that's why we're feeling great about the pipeline. We're feeling great about the POCs and all of those metrics continue to be strong and good. And so we just consider this a pause, one caused by the introduction of an exciting new product and greater value for us to offer and the other caused by the external forces that I think impacted a lot of our colleagues in the industry. There's also one more thing that I think is in the day-to-day conversation with a more strategic customer and that is considering Avalon and the feature set that we're bringing to the market with that product. And again, it's impossible to quantify the impact of each of these things, but you get those, the confluence of those 3 things going together with one of them being outside of our control, and that's what we saw in the quarter. But no impact on pipeline and our outlook in terms of the value proposition and desktop virtualization. If anything, the relevance and value is going up as customers rethink how they want to deliver Windows apps and desktops in a world gone mobile, the world gone heterogeneous in terms of devices and network types of connections, which is creating lots of adjacent opportunity in cross-sell as you could tell from the report in our networking business. So that's how we frame out what happened in the desktop business and the outlook. Then on the ROI front, the fact is virtual apps and the ROI on virtual apps and hosted desktops are -- have classically and always been very strong. In fact, paybacks within 6 months oftentimes on the deployment and delivery of a hosted virtual desktop or a hosted Windows app. The ROI conversation is really a conversation focused around hosted virtual VDI types of desktops, where there are huge amounts of storage and issues around storage performance, all of which, by the way, are receiving a tremendous amount of invention and innovation from us, from Microsoft and from a number of our other Citrix-ready ecosystem partners. So that will actually continue to get better and better across the year as these storage solutions actually change the ROI economics on VDI. But the overall ROI on desktop virtualization as a whole and specifically on virtual Windows apps and virtual hosted desktops continues to be very strong and one of the value propositions that goes back to the very, very beginning.","Operator","We have a question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wonder if you can talk about, it seems like in desktop and mobile space, the market has really come to you in terms like BYO and mobility, but it sounds like at the same time, your performance in this area has been worse than it was back when I think all of us questioned whether or not there was real demand for these products and you were doing things like trade-up and things like that to kind of jumpstart demand. And I'm wondering if part of what's going on here maybe that you presold capacity, or gave away a lot of the value in the prior sales during the trade-up period, and I'm wondering is that an issue here or you can tell me what customers that are in the midst of deployment that have already bought and therefore not coming back to buy more?","David James Henshall","Walter, it's David. It's -- I don't think that's the case. I mean, when customers were trading up from virtual apps to kind of a superset of virtual desktops, it was more just broadening the capability of the solution and giving them the opportunity to really use it on a more strategic basis, moving from tactical use cases, projects, et cetera, to something about more infrastructure-like. But we've always sold on really on a per user or maybe in some cases, per concurrent user basis and had penetration that is roughly in that 10% to 15% range. So I don't think that's not the case at all. I think what's going on right now is just making sure that we've got the complete solution that is packaged and interoperable in a way that really solves all these problems for customers in a simple, elegant, powerful way. One of the things that we've talked about around desktop virtualization for several quarters now is just the flip side of being a broad powerful solution is that it is inherently complex. And the things that we can do as a vendor to really bring down that level of complexity or, frankly, abstract it away for customers so that they can go faster. So that they can adopt, scale and manage these technologies without a broad level of skill set or outside assistance. And that's really what I think is probably the primary barrier to a much broader scale and adoption. And that's what we've been really talking about in the context of Avalon for quite some time now. As those releases hit the market later this year, that's a primary focal point. And then in the back half of the year, as we start to bring together some of our clouds assets with desktop virtualization, just further making it easier for customers to turn virtual desktops into a delivery service whether that's something that they acquire externally through a service provider or really put up in their own data centers for just easier management. We need to be -- we need to keep providing those tools. So I think that's probably a much bigger deal than anything that has to do with the prior sales in the business.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then, David, just on the guidance, I think Q1 you obviously had some things change in the quarter, environment got worse, but it is probably the first quarter I can remember where you were on the low-end of your guidance range. And I'm wondering if you could just talk about the Q2 guidance in that context and are you being more conservative than you were in Q1, or any color on the assumption sort of that you're applying versus what you've done in the past.","David James Henshall","Sure, Walter. I mean, it's tough for us to measure things on the spectrum of aggressive versus conservative but I will say that guidance is always influenced by the period that you're just exiting. And so there is a level of hesitation that comes starting from the field organization up through sales management and as we think about guidance and wanting to make sure we're being appropriately prudent and conservative there. And you offset that with the level of pipeline coverage, the certainty around any identified transactions that might have slipped out of a prior period and whatnot. And so yes, we've got a number of those factors in play that are certainly influencing our guidance for Q2 and the balance of the year. I will say that versus maybe a Q4 time frame, the environment hasn't been as certainly vibrant or robust as it was at that point in time. But, frankly, all of our field teams are feeling modestly better about Q2. And, of course, that's backed up by the pipeline. But as I said earlier, this period felt like CIOs really absorbing Q4 purchases, laying down budgets for the balance of the year, really planning out the new projects that they're willing to initiate, and I think that our solutions are playing really well into that outlook.","Operator","You have a question from Israel Hernandez with MKM Partners.","Israel Hernandez - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","For Dave, on the Q2 EPS guidance, which was materially below where the consensus was, can you just kind of talk about what were some of the drivers impacting Q2 and EPS guidance because it seems pretty off. I think it's one of the reasons why the stock is getting smoked in the aftermarket besides the fact that desktop business tailed off. But also, can you also comment on the -- in relationship with Cisco and the progress being made there, as well as any impact from sequestration in the federal vertical?","David James Henshall","Let me start with the federal and kind of work my way through those questions. Some impact, of course. I think in the U.S. fed -- actually, the Americas geo, to start there, actually had a very good quarter and a pretty linear quarter. And so the teams delivered strong across all product areas. Now U.S. fed, as you would expect, low growth year-on-year with most of the impact coming from the desktop products. Flip side of that is we saw professional services up about 30% year-on-year and U.S. fed is they're working through implementations, proof of concepts on new solutions and we saw NetScaler up sharply, albeit off a small base, but we're starting to get traction across the U.S. fed and agencies there. I think the priorities in fed are going to be around data center consolidation, cyber security and mobility. Those are probably the big 3, so a lot of our projects will be focused on those areas going forward. I would expect that continue to be issues around individual budgets for project for the next couple of quarters certainly as we get through Q3.","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, I'll take the Cisco question. So Israel,  the relationship there I mentioned it in the prepared comments. And so first step is recommendation of NetScaler to customers who need more advanced app delivery services beyond Ace. And we saw some good pipeline build, some good deals in traction. A handful, about a dozen, really good deals in the quarter, and we expect that to continue forward as we continue to build those relationships in the field and with specific customers. The second area of focus that's going quite well is the technical integrations that we're doing between NetScaler and Cisco, various pieces of the Cisco platform. So we recently demonstrated NetScaler VPX running on Nexus, and received with great enthusiasm by the Cisco field. So that gives us more momentum and more mind share with them and helps build the relationship. And then the next big milestone will be the much deeper integrations that we're doing where-- we haven't announced anything on those yet and how it will go to market together. But obviously, the purpose of doing them on both the Cisco and the Citrix side is to deliver a beautifully integrated application delivery network solution on top of Cisco's smart, intelligent network platform. So that's to come and think of that more as a second half phenomenon.","David James Henshall","And the last question is really just specifically about EPS guidance. I would point out that this is the first time we have provided guidance for Q2 so that we haven't said anything about that previously, so we're not necessarily changing guidance. However, the shape of the year is different than the way most people have modeled it. Our full year guidance, we are confirming the top line on a total revenue basis, albeit with some mix across the individual product areas. And on the bottom line, we tweaked that a little bit but really just to align other interest income where most people had modeled that far in excess of what's available in the market right now. So the year is going to be shaped more back-ended, but that's not what you would expect as we're starting to ramp 2 new businesses around XenMobile and Bytemobile. So really nothing beyond to consider.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of quick questions. One, David, I wanted to know if you're still expecting $30 million for -- from Zenprise for the year. And just if you could give us a sense of how much of that is licensed just so we can think back with the comments you made before. And then can you also share with us how you see NetScaler helping to pull along Bytemobile sales and how often are these being pitched together and the opportunity to do that going forward? And then, I guess, the last thing I would ask would just be to if you could characterize the competitive environment with F5?","David James Henshall","Heather, on the first question around Zenprise, yes, still expect $30 million on revenue contribution this year. And probably, 2\/3 of that being in product license and the balance being in subscriptions, SaaS or technical services. In terms of Bytemobile pulling -- or NetScaler pulling through Bytemobile, in fact, it's usually the other way around. And so what we've seen early on is that for a large Bytemobile deployment, there's generally some functionality that's provided by a NetScaler, whether it's load-balancing or other activities, that while it's early days, the ratio is about 15% or 10% to 15%. So for every $1 of Bytemobile sale, there is an opportunity to pull through about $0.10 to $0.15 of NetScaler. And that's what we've seen so far, and that's certainly in line with really the strategic rationale behind this opportunity really opening up the broader telco segment for us, which we haven't participated in the past. And as far as competition, specific competition with F5, I'd say it's unchanged. They continue to be highly competitive in a number of cases, and our growth is not necessarily all head-to-head with them. It's simply we're participating in a broader segment of opportunities than we had historically. We talked about a lot of those. And on a pure feature function, product-to-product level, I think versus the rest of the industry, we just have a great breadth of solutions right now, providing good price performance mix for customers, but ultimately just great flexibility as they think about this evolution from what used to be load balancing through application delivery through managing the virtual data center going forward. I hope that answers your questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment in the desktop mobility solutions. It seems to me that within desktop, you guys -- or virtual desktop, in particular, you guys have a pretty well defined set of competitors there. When we move into a broader mobility solutions, mobility means a lot of things to a lot of different people and it seems there is a lot of players in that space. Is there any aspect of maybe confusion in the marketplace or maybe people trying to seek some kind of a better idea of what types of solutions they want, who are the competitors in that space that you guys have to work through as you kind of shift the value proposition or shift the positioning of that overall business?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Keith, I'll take that on the front-end. So the way to think about this is kind of from the top down, all right? There's an overall space that we call enterprise mobility management. These are comprised of a number of segments around the delivery of mobile apps, mobile data, mobile mail, mobile Intranet and the security and device management required to support all of that. So that's a big \u00fcber market with our strategy around XenMobile and XenDesktop together. We think we have an unbeatable combination to answer that because we have best-of-breed in all those categories and we add the ability to virtualize every Windows app and desktop in the world as part of that. So that's the \u00fcber EMM. And when you talk to a CIO, you talk to the senior most IT leadership, you talk to line of business leaders, that's the kind of solution they are looking for. There is really no confusion there. And by the way, in Q1, a number of the big wins in desktop and mobile were all about EMM and really this sort of complete solution. The next level and actually at the end other end of the spectrum, as part of EMM is MDM, the mobile device management. In that marketplace, recently fragmented, a lot of players, we have an upper quartile Gartner Magic Quadrant solution in the form of a product that we -- the Zenprise that we acquired and the XenMobile MDM addition that we released. We regularly are beating those competitors like MobileIron and AirWatch are standout sort of segment-specific competitors and it is quite fragmented. I don't think there's any confusion there because the buyers are typically the buyer that's been running the BlackBerry infrastructure and specifically responsible for mobile security. In between those is a space that we've been focused on for a little over 1 year now and through our CloudGateway product and that's the mobile app management space. This is a space that is going to be a battleground where in this space, it's about delivering native mobile apps, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, et cetera, combined with all the policy controls and security you need to do that in the context of BYO and even corporate-owned devices. So in that space, what we're seeing is more and more of those kinds of decisions are being pushed up the stack to the decision-makers that are responsible for  desktops, app infrastructure, networking infrastructure and they're becoming more and more of a strategic conversation, and that's the clear trend line. There, the competition is -- it's not a clear market yet. We're actually working hard to define that market through the work that we've done with CloudGateway and what we'll be announcing next month. And so I don't think there's confusion there. In fact, we see ourselves as being the leader in that segment and have the ability to actually steer this marketplace from that segment on up.","Israel Hernandez - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Excellent. That was very helpful. And maybe if I could sneak in one tactical modeling question, professional services was up pretty sharply sequentially from a 4Q and then pretty low growth there. I'm assuming that's probably a function of some of the desktop products coming in weaker than expected. Should we expect that to bounce back in a big way as we look into 2Q and we expect growth to resume in the back half of the year?","David James Henshall","Yes. I think it's a function of what the teams are working on, utilization, and our ability to actually recognize contracts. So from a year-on-year basis, I would expect that growth to bounce in Q2 back up closer to 20% or more.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International.","James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","As you get your pipeline and expectations and improved activity in Q2 on desktop, I'd be curious what your assumptions are in terms of where the demand levels are coming back. Is it a function of some of the thawed deals in the U.S. maybe hitting in Q2, are you seeing some better stability in Europe and maybe if financial service is looking better, maybe some color on vertical and geographic perspectives. And then the second question is on CloudStack. There's been a lot of discussion on OpenStack. CloudStack doesn't get the same amount of buzz in the press, but certainly it does in the industry. So I'd just be curious how you guys may benefit from success on the CloudStack side?","David James Henshall","Yes. Let me take the first part of that question and I'll turn it over to Mark. In terms of the overall demand environment for Q2, like we said a few times, I mean mostly it's just based specifically on identified transactions, identified opportunities and pipeline coverage, which is much stronger in Q2 than it was in Q1. So from an environment standpoint, all of our teams are feeling -- and this is true throughout the world, all of our teams are feeling much more optimistic about Q2 than they were in Q1 and that's a function of those things, not necessarily the environment getting materially better, just a matter of specific pipeline and opportunity. So that's how we think about it. And I wouldn't say it's really a vertical issue, but it is true across all geos.","Mark B. Templeton","Derrick, on your question on CloudStack, so it's still a PO versus PR battle. OpenStack is definitely winning the PR battle, continues to win. And CloudStack continues to win the PO battle in terms of real implementations driving real revenue. In the last few months, we've seen a couple of things. First of all, the community size has grown enormously. And as everyone knows, CloudStack is an open-source project. And about a month ago, Apache Software Foundation promoted CloudStack to first level project within the foundation and is now the largest project within the Apache Software Foundation. We are also seeing that a number of ecosystem and community members in OpenStack have also begun to join the CloudStack community as well. And so in some ways, when it comes to some of the underlying and additional value adds around the open-source community, some of the lines are getting blurred between OpenStack and CloudStack when it comes to the open-source community. Of course, our strategy is pretty simple that we are contributing in an aggressive way to CloudStack and making it part of our CloudPlatform commercial product that also includes XenCenter technology and interfaces and integrations with NetScaler. And those couple of other factors are the reason we think that we're winning the PO battle, including some of the things that we've done above the stack, above CloudPlatform with our Cloud Poodle product that, again, runs at an even higher layer to orchestrate services across clouds, and we continue to see opportunity to monetize both CloudPlatform and CloudPortal into the future.","I think that's our last question. And I'd like to, in closing, thank everyone for joining today and invite all of you to Synergy, which is in Los Angeles from May 22 to 24. We've got a really exciting conference planned. It will be another sellout. We really hope you'll join us. As we look forward, anticipating what customers want and need, we see a really rapidly evolving world where we can be a key player in enabling mobile work styles powered by Citrix cloud infrastructure and services. So thanks again for joining, and we'll see you soon again.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's Citrix conference call.

David?","David James Henshall","Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Entering 2014, we continued our pivot towards mobile, recognizing that customers are looking for better ways to embrace mobility, the cloud, IT, consumerization and BYOD. We kicked off the year in January hosting our Citrix Summit events in Orlando, Santa Barbara and Singapore, bringing together our worldwide sales teams and a record number of partners for intense product and solutions training, all focused on driving customer success. As a leading provider of infrastructure and cloud services, we helped these customers to deliver a secure, managed mobile workspace by mobilizing apps, data and people. In parallel, we continue to drive innovation in the data center with our unique technologies across physical and virtual networking platforms, powering some of the world's largest clouds and giving enterprises the capabilities to combine best-in-class app networking services on a single consolidated footprint. I'm extremely proud of the Citrix team and our partners, whose hard work has been critical as we continue to drive this transition to mobile and cloud.","So let's review the specifics of the quarter. As you can see from the release, total revenue increased 12% year-on-year to $751 million. Product license revenue grew 7% year-on-year. Our total SaaS business was $157 million, up 14%. Adjusted EPS was $0.64, and we generated record cash flow from operations of $288 million. In Q1, we closed 43 transactions greater than $1 million each as compared to 41 a year ago. Importantly, 22 of these transactions came from the Desktop & Mobile business, including 2 that were exclusively for XenMobile solutions. Additionally, the average value of these large orders was up more than 20% year-on-year.","Geographically, the EMEA region continues to deliver steady growth, increasing total revenue 15% and driving $12-million plus transactions. In the Americas region, total revenue was up 9%, including 28 large transactions, and the Pacific and Japan region grew 8% year-on-year.","So next, let's look at the Q1 results with our 3 primary businesses. First, our Mobile & Desktop business grew 7% from last year to $381 million. We've been driving a broader conversation with customers about transforming their enterprise to enable mobile work-style. The XenMobile products are really proving to be the catalyst to these conversations as we continue to set the bar in enterprise mobility with MDM, mobile apps, virtual apps and desktops and data all in a unified, secure solution. In fact, over 85% of our mobile platforms customers opted for this complete solution, demonstrating the value of the integrated offering versus stand-alone MDM technologies. In the aggregate, we're really pleased with our revenue and pipeline momentum here. And while still a small component of overall revenue, mobile platforms grew well over 100% year-on-year in Q1.","We're also rapidly addressing the issues that have impacted overall growth within the desktop and app part of this business. In Q1, we delivered unique innovations, including hybrid cloud provisioning, where customers are now able to provision and deliver desktops and applications from the Citrix CloudPlatform, Amazon Web Services, and soon, Microsoft Azure. This increases data center flexibility, disaster recovery, burst capacity and many other business imperatives. We've also integrated our AppDNA capabilities to reduce the cost and complexity of migrating from physical to virtual.","In March, we relaunched XenApp, the market standard for Windows app virtualization. Building on more than 20 years of customer-driven features and requirements, the new 7.5 addition now leverages the FlexCast Management Architecture that dramatically reduces the cost and complexity of virtualizing 5 generations of Windows apps and delivering them to users on any mobile, desktop or Thin Client device. XenApp is also the foundational technology that's been leveraged by Citrix service providers to deliver apps and desktops as a service. This subscription business, now servicing over 360,000 users, is one of our fastest expanding market segments, growing more than 50% year-on-year and now representing nearly 10% of our app and desktop license mix.","So we're delivering a complete enterprise mobility solution, allowing customers to bridge the worlds of Windows and mobility. And to do so, all with a people-centric experience that only Citrix can provide.","Next, in the Networking & Cloud business, total revenue increased by 13% in the quarter to $167 million. NetScaler products were again the major driver of this business, with balanced growth between both enterprise customers and Internet and cloud providers.","For a little bit more context, let me touch on a few metrics from Q1. First, the cross-sell in desktop attach initiatives led to over 500 virtualization and mobile orders that included NetScaler as part of the solution. This is up about 9% from a year ago. We transacted with over 2,100 different customers in the period compared with about 1,900 a year ago, so we continue to expand the base. From a mixed perspective, the NetScaler SDX platform represented 12% of NetScaler sales and increased about 40% year-on-year. And finally, the investments that we've been making in go-to-market coverage in EMEA continue to bear fruit, leading to 25% growth year-on-year in that geo.","Finally, within our SaaS businesses, revenue, as I mentioned, was up 14% to $157 million. The communications cloud, which contain services like GoToMeeting, remains the largest part of our SaaS business, contributing over 60% of total SaaS revenue and growing in the mid-teens year-on-year.","Our documents cloud, which is based on ShareFile, the data sharing platform that enables IT to deliver robust sharing and sync services that meet the mobility and collaboration needs of its users and the data security requirements demanded by the enterprise, this business is scaling up nicely. It's up about 65% from the last year and now represents more than 8% of our total mix of SaaS. That's compared to between 5% and 6% a year ago.","By integrating data into our emerging mobile platforms, we're also expanding the reach of these solutions in the enterprise accounts, giving them the option of leveraging the ShareFile connectors into their own data centers or to cloud storage providers -- platforms like Microsoft Azure.","So turning to operations, adjusted op margin was 21% in Q1. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 85%. This is down about 128 basis points from a year ago as the mix of revenue reflects the higher growth of both networking and SaaS. We expect this trend to continue through 2014 but level off as we move into 2015.","During Q1, we added 95 net new people to Citrix to expand go-to-market reach and customer direct touch, primarily around the networking business. Additionally, we've been investing to expand our documents, cloud and mobile platforms team. And overall, we expect fairly modest growth in headcount throughout the remainder of 2014.","As part of rebalancing resources really directly against our strategic imperatives, we incurred a $10 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, and we expect a smaller but related charge to also be included in Q2 GAAP results.","Looking at the balance sheet, cash and investments at the end of March were over $1.8 billion, up primarily due to record cash flow from operations, as I mentioned earlier. For the trailing 12 months, cash flow from ops has been approximately $950 million or about $5 per share. With respect to our capital allocation strategy and our continued commitment to generate value for shareholders, we announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in our share repurchase program of $1.5 billion, and this is in addition to the $429 million still remaining under the prior authorization.","We're focused on a sound capital allocation strategy that balances investments in the long-term growth of our business and returning capital to shareholders. We anticipate that our share repurchase for the full year of 2014 will be significantly above 2013 levels, and we plan to purchase shares through both structured programs on the -- as well as on the open market, depending upon market conditions and other relevant factors.","We'll discuss this strategy in more detail during our financial analyst event at Citrix Synergy in Anaheim, California on May 6. These presentations will be webcast live and available on the Investors section of the Citrix website. At the main Synergy conference, which runs from May 6 through May 8, we'll be joined by Cisco, Microsoft, IBM, HP, Dell and over 50 other technology partners, showcasing mobile workspace solutions for health care, financial services, education and many other industries. We also have many new and exciting announcements that will continue to further our market and technology leadership. I hope you're planning on joining us and the many thousands of other attendees from around the world.","So turning to our current outlook and expectations for 2014, I'd like to first provide some context around our guidance. We expect to see the strongest forward growth coming from our networking, mobile platforms and data sharing businesses. The strength in networking, as we described in Q1, will likely compress gross margins by 1.5 to 2 percentage points from last year, ultimately impacting our overall operating margin.","So overall, we're very happy with the solid Q1 results and the good start to 2014. However, given that we're still very early in the year, we're going to maintain our conservative posture towards forward guidance, but feel confident in raising the low end of our current full year estimates for both revenue and EPS.","So for our fiscal year '14, our current expectations are now for total revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10%, adjusted gross margin in a range of 84% to 85%, adjusted tax rate of 24% and adjusted EPS between $2.90 and $2.95 per share. With respect to Q2, we expect total revenue of $765 million to $775 million, adjusted gross margin in the range of 84% to 85% and adjusted EPS between $0.57 and $0.59 a share.","As we open up the call for questions, I want to remind you that I'm joined today by Mark Templeton and Sudhakar Ramakrishna, who are both available to answer your questions.","So operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Chaitanya Yaramada for Steve Ashley. I just wanted to drill into the second quarter guidance a little bit. You mentioned conservatism. Given we are early in the year, I was just wondering if there was any deal pull forward or anything like that, that you're taking into account when giving the second quarter guidance. Or is it just basically conservatism, as you mentioned?","David James Henshall","Sure. This is David. This is -- as you know, this is the first time we've provided the second quarter guidance. I mean, we -- last quarter, we just talked about the first period and the full year, and that's our normal pattern. So I'd say it's normal conservatism, like we have always at this point in the year. Nothing specific. We did have a very strong quarter in Q1 against networking business. As we've talked about many times, that tends to be a little bit more volatile than the other line items. And while we're likely to have another good quarter in Q2 around networking, it's more challenging to forecast. I'd say that's the only unique thing quarter-to-quarter. The rest is just very straightforward.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then quickly, I might have missed the desktop license growth that you normally give. If you can provide that, please?","David James Henshall","Now if everyone recalls, like we talked about each quarter last year, starting this year, we are moving up the granularity that we're reporting the business to more align with the way customers are thinking about it. I mean, we're -- as you know, we're selling more and more solution-type sales that are including different line items of the business, more multi-year transactions, more subscription. And so we're only going to be reporting the businesses at a total revenue level and license revenue in the aggregate.","Operator","And your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to dig into the product license line on the Mobile & Desktop side. It seemed like you had a solid bounce back there in terms of license growth. Wondering if you could provide us with more detail as far as, really, what's driving that? I mean, did you start to see the impact from the release of 7.5 of XenApp? Or was this a kind rebound on the XenDesktop side? Or is sort of XenMobile finally hitting the point of contributing to overall growth?","David James Henshall","Sure, Philip. It's David. Like I said, we're not going to drill into the individual components with granularity, but let me give you some directional indications of what's going on in the business. So of the 3 main sections -- I mean, we have seen very strong growth in XenMobile and mobile platforms overall. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, up about 100%, more than 100% year-on-year. We continue to see growth in standalone desktop virtualization, and that's offset by a decline in standalone app virtualization. And so that's the way to think about it, and we're addressing each one of those through different parts of the business. The other thing I'd mention that I forgot to on the last question about Q2 is that if you recall last year, we had a very, very strong second quarter. So the comp for Q3 -- or excuse me, for Q2, is very high. I think we were up 21% license growth last year and 20% total revenue growth. So that may be the answer that I forgot for the second question.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And then maybe if you guys could just drill down on the XenApp side, I know you mentioned that, that was one of the area's weakness in 2013. Obviously, 7.5 just came out very early in Q1. Have you started to see an impact from that? And if not, when do you think you'll really see sort of channel and customers re-acceptance or better understanding of the forward roadmap there?","David James Henshall","Yes. Phil. As you know, XenApp is one of those products that we deemphasized over the course of last year, and it certainly impacted both our go-to-market and our customers around more tactical project-based applications. That's where XenApp has historically been strong. That's where it's been a market-dominant product for the better part of 20 years. And so reengaging with that, we believe, is an important element for both go-to-market and of course for that segment of customer that has been weaker over the course of the last several quarters. So 7.5 hit the market at the very end of the quarter. We're on a very rapid release cycle right now. And I talked about a couple of those elements again in my prepared remarks, but we're excited about where that's going, and we've got a lot of confidence in that. So probably more to talk about in the quarter than we have right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","David, I just wanted to drill a little bit on what we discussed on your Q4 call. Any more considerations that the company has given to how you could realign the business model to add more of a subscription wrinkle, given that desktop as a service is now up 50%. And it alone, by my rough calculations, added about 10 points of growth for your Desktop business. How do see the future of the Citrix business model? Do you envision this becoming more of a subscription-type model? And also, secondarily, if you could comment on the expense reductions and how this new restructuring will contribute to your operating margin profile despite the fact that you have adverse mix with more NetScaler?","David James Henshall","Sure, Kash. Let me take the second part of that question first. With respect to costs and margins -- I mean, some of the restructuring that I talked about earlier was really more tactical and aligning, making sure we're aligning resource against the most strategic imperatives of the business. And that is a tough process that we're always going through, and this is really focused on efficiency, delayering and just making sure we're up leveling the team across the board. So that's really the way to think about that. In terms of the broader question around subscription -- I mean, it's a valid question for really any enterprise software provider right now. I mean, customers are more and more looking at consuming things on a utility basis or a service basis, and that's for 2 reasons: one is it matches up the business model pretty cleanly; and secondly, services allow vendors like Citrix to abstract away a lot of the complexity that it takes to manage and scale infrastructure. And so we are driving a number of initiatives on that front. Nothing that I'm willing to talk about broadly on a call like this, but I say some of the early elements of that are our SaaS business, which is more than 20% of the company. Our service providers that are delivering apps and desktops as a service, mobile that is now being delivered in both cloud and on-premise options and a number of other areas. So stay tuned. Come to Citrix Synergy, we'll talk more about product direction and futures at that point in time. When it becomes much more material for the financial model, obviously, we'll be talking about that in advance of any material shift in the business model.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could ask a question of Mark, Mark, any update on the CEO search? And also, how do you think about the share dynamics in desktop virtualization? Obviously, VMware has been putting up some good numbers. How do we think about the Citrix growth profile in that market as you look out? Obviously, something is happening. The growth rates are starting to pick up, at least for your major competitor. I just wanted to get your thoughts on it.","Mark B. Templeton","Sure, Kash. There's no data to share on CEO search. As I think everyone knows, these things need to be held closely and managed by the board, and so that process is ongoing. Secondly, I feel really good about our competitive position not only when it comes to VMware, but generally in the marketplace when it comes to serving the mobility needs of individuals and enterprises, especially when you take into consideration the full range of media types that need to be delivered successfully across the range of devices. So we've long stood for device and location independence. We've long stood for the ability to deliver Windows desktops and apps in a general-purpose way, and we've added core capabilities to deliver SaaS and native mobile apps and data as well. And so I think no one is in a better position to bring all these assets together and provide the kind of platform that's needed for the -- what we consider to be sort of the modern workplace, which is a mobile workspace that is device and location independent, as well as application independent, supported by a very strong data platform that's secure, and that can be shared amongst all of these -- all the apps and desktops at the front end. So I feel really good about where we are. We're going to have some exciting things to talk about at Synergy. And a more competitive world is what everyone in the industry is facing. And we have an incredible customer base, an impressible IT portfolio and an incredible application and infrastructure portfolio. And we'll bring a lot more clarity to all that for not only enterprise customers, our service providers, our SMB customers and then a couple of surprises as well. So we're pretty excited about the conference and the outlook going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","With Windows XP support ending, are you noticing any behavioral changes in the customer base or the conversations you're currently having with regard to the desktop portfolio?","David James Henshall","Good, Rob. This is David. I'd say nothing specific. It is one of the things that are generating conversations with customers, but probably no more so than the last quarter or 2.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then, David, sorry if I missed it but on the buyback front, it looked like you were a lot less aggressive here in the first quarter than you were in the fourth quarter. I know the board authorizing a lot more repurchase activity moving forward, but why the change sequentially? It looks like a pretty meaningful change.","David James Henshall","Well, the only thing is we're looking at capital structure and repurchase more holistically. And I can point you to the other releases that we put out today. And I'm not really at liberty to talk about that as an active security offering. However, we will be talking much more granularly about how we're thinking about capital structure, return of capital, et cetera, at our May 6 financial analyst meeting.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And what was the amount of the buyback during Q1?","David James Henshall","De minimis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was wondering if we could get an update on the CEO search, perhaps in terms of sort of how far along you guys feel you are. And maybe some color into kind of what are some of the key attributes you guys are looking at for Mark's successor?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes. I think this is probably a topic that we not -- we prefer not to discuss openly on the call, and it's being managed by the board and the search committee. We have seen candidates, and the search is very active. And I think, obviously, we're looking for things that we value most in people and leaders. And the first is culture, cultural fit. How we do business matters to us as much as how much business we do, and it's been a foundation for the company for a long, long time and one of the long-term strength of the company as you face business cycles over the long time. I think the second area that we are very much looking for is someone who's a strong product leader and product-oriented visionary. I think these -- the landscape, how it's changing, is affecting how we're thinking about candidates and their ability to steer the company and lead the company through any rapidly evolving landscape. And I'd say the third is what I like to refer to as leader of leaders, and that is a great team builder and to really come in and be part of a fantastic team that we have here. And those would be the leading characteristics at a high level. But I think a lot more discussion about the search, we'd rather defer and leave that in the hands of the search committee.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fair enough. If I could squeeze in one more, in terms of the mobile business and the competitive environment there, obviously, a big change in competitive environment with VMware buying AirWatch. I also see Microsoft come out with sort of a refresh of their product portfolio and a suite solution. Can you talk to us a little bit about how that competitive environment is evolving, if you see any change in terms of sort of how customers are thinking about those solutions or who you're going up against in terms of these deals?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Sure, this is Sudhakar, I'll take that question. Specific to VMware and the acquisition of AirWatch, at some level, that was really not a surprise to us, as we commented last time as well. As you know, their focus has predominantly been in the mobile device management arena, whereas we have focused on application and content management in addition to device management. I consider ourselves to have best-in-class mobile device management capabilities, and additionally, we are focused on apps and content management. And what we are seeing from customers is an increasing focus on application and content management capabilities and not just device management capabilities. And as you know, competitors such as AirWatch have entered the app management arena only recently. As it relates to Microsoft, a lot of their focus continues to be in the context of their in-tune service, which again is, broadly speaking, a mobile device management solution. Just to give you some perspective to build and deliver secure productivity applications at scale, a company needs a platform for building applications, first and foremost; an ecosystem that can leverage this platform and rapidly create applications, some horizontal applications and some vertical application; a scalable application delivery infrastructure platform that provides things like security, user-level analytics, acceleration and so on and so forth, that our best-in-class NetScaler product line provides; and the assets and the ability to integrate and deliver great experiences across a wide range of applications. Those could be native mobile application, Windows applications and SaaS applications. We are the only company that has all of these assets and the delivery capabilities to integrate and deliver superior experiences to our customers, and this is the reason why I feel extremely confident in our leadership position and our ability to continue to extend that leadership position with our stellar roadmaps.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask a little bit about your near term -- or medium-term and long-term operating margin target. I mean, just given the fact that the networking business continues to kind of drive the growth of the company, I'm just wondering if you could kind of give us a refresher on when -- what type of target should we be thinking about? And how do you -- how long do you think it takes you to get there as we look out over the course of the next few years?","David James Henshall","Yes, Heather, it's David. I mean, without giving specific guidance beyond what we've done publicly already, I'd say directionally, we haven't changed our belief that the company should be operating in the mid- to upper-20s in terms of adjusted op margin. We're certainly below that right now for a number of investments, new businesses we're ramping, and obviously this shift in gross margin that's been providing a bunch of headwind. So we're focused on addressing this in a couple of different dimensions. One is obviously growing through the new business dilution as we ramp, in particular, businesses like data sharing, like mobile platforms, et cetera. Second, in terms of overall gross margin, we do -- and I talked about this the last couple of quarters -- we do see that flattening out here in the kind of 2015 time frame. So next year, that'll cease to be a headwind. So efficiencies that we drive both on the top line and internally will accrete to higher leverage. And then, of course, we are very focused on looking at the overall portfolio and efficiencies in the business to see in what areas we can drive higher productivity. So it's a combination of all 3 of those things. But directionally, certainly are still targeting that mid- to upper-20s range, and want to be moving in that direction currently.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess, David, could you just -- David, could you talk a little bit about the growth in EMEA? Sorry if someone asked this already. But I guess how much of that is due to the economic environment potentially getting a little bit better? How much of it is sort of your guys' execution and\/or I guess just better sales coverage? Because I know you guys have been adding resources over there over the past year or so.","David James Henshall","I think the short answer is all of the above. We've got a strong team that has been led by Carlos Satorios. They're doing a great job driving growth across all the businesses. I called out networking in particular because that is one of those areas that, about a year ago, we said we were going to be investing in aggressively. We had capacity constraints, and so we've been driving across that. We've seen great results there, and it's certainly a model -- we have the capacity to replicate it in other places. At the same time, the markets are, I'd say, maybe modestly improving in some areas and at least stabilizing in others. So we're kind of getting rid of that headwind of economic pressures to the extent that it was last year. I wouldn't call it robust environment. I think people are still very focused on capital allocation, on costs, et cetera, but it's more normalized than it has been for a few quarters. So across the board, yes to all 3 of those points you raised.","Operator","And your next question comes from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess just sort of a follow-up and not just for Europe, David. Could you talk a little bit about how you're doing with your go-to-market coverage? There was some -- there was an issue the last couple of quarters for weak desktop and mobile sales. It appears things might be getting better there, but can you just update us on that?","David James Henshall","Yes. John, it's kind of a multifaceted question, I'd say. In terms of go-to-market coverage -- I mean, there's certainly some places where we don't have the breadth of coverage we'd like to, to be able to meet customer demand. That's probably a statement both pre and post sales. And a lot of that is also really focused on networking, which tends to be a more specialized discipline than core virtualization would be. So I highlight EMEA because it's one of those areas we made the largest investments and have seen great returns so far. But we are still capacity-constrained in a lot of markets, where we just don't have enough coverage. And one of the investments we've been making, of course, one of the reasons why you've seen such outsized growth in our Networking business over the last couple of years. In terms of the other business -- I mean, we're in early stages of ramping what I'd call more traditional channel partners against mobile platforms. A lot of training and certifications, et cetera, were taking place in the first quarter, but that's going to be an ongoing process for a while. That's still early days, and we need to get that -- get that in the hands of all the partners and get them ramping. In terms of what I think the last question is around more traditional CSA channel partners, the one area that we are focused on right now is reinvigorating XenApp, because that typical project-based sale was often handled very directly by channel partners. With the deemphasis of that product over the past couple of years, it has impacted engagement to some levels. And so as we bring that back out, we help them with the appropriate migrations, assistance, et cetera. That's one of the things that we're doing to reengage that element of the channel. So, John, a pretty long answer, but I think there's a number of different factors that are really underlying the overall go-to-market motion.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that's actually very helpful, David. But it sounds like a lot of the stuff you have in place, and you've had in place -- and it's starting to work. But it sounds like there are some things you're still going to be doing. Does that conflict at all with what you talked about with your goals for operating margins? Or is that something that's figured into that?","David James Henshall","I think it's all figured into it effectively. I mean, it's not specifically called out. At the end of the day, the more we can work with partners, the higher leverage we're going to have as a company. I mean, we have partnering as part of our DNA. That's how we were founded, and that's really where we see a lot of opportunity in the future. So we're very focused on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Ken Wong for Walter. Building a bit on Rob's question earlier, you guys used to talk a little bit about how hardware refreshes presented good opportunity to approach customers about XenDesktop. I mean, did you guys see any uplift with the recent -- kind of the recent strength in corporate refresh? And any concern we should have that it might become a headwind in the back half now that the XP end-of-life is kind of over and done with?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","We don't have any particular concerns. And with regards to additional traction, I'd say, XP end-of-life is still a very recent event. So I wouldn't say we have enough data points to call out a trend at this point in time. We see a variety of customer needs. And as David was mentioning earlier with regards to the larger enterprise customer, DV continues to be strategic for a variety of reasons. And with the migration to 2012, Windows Server 2012 is when we see some additional uptick happening within this business.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Great. And then you guys saw pretty good strength in technical services this quarter. What was the driver of that?","David James Henshall","I'd say it's largely implementation of large transactions from the end of last year.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Should we expect that to continue heading into the back half of the year?","David James Henshall","Well, I'd say, as you know, that number does tend to move around just depending upon utilization. I mean, the growth rates last year ranged anywhere from 2%, to -- I think it was 28% or 29%. So it'll bounce around a bit year-on-year, but real high utilization in Q1 and good progress. I mean, we're -- as I mentioned earlier, one of the areas that we continue to do very well in is in large transactions. I said it pretty quickly in my prepared remarks, but an interesting element of the large transactions is that the average size actually is up more than 20% year-on-year, from where we were in Q1. So we're selling larger, more complex, more multi-product elements that are requiring a higher level of architectural assistance, guidance around our consulting organization and really just helping customers scale and be successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So, David, I just wanted to drill down on that last comment a little bit. It seemed that there's a strong need here for tighter integration across all of these products, and the differentiation might very well be the breadth of the offering that you're able to bring to market. I think you've been working on more and more product integration. Can you give us a sense of where you stand in achieving the level of product integration that you'd like to? And you've mentioned there's more big deals. I'd be kind of curious about the pipeline looking forward. Should we continue to expect, as you work more on integrating the product portfolio, that the deals continue to increase in size?","David James Henshall","Yes, Rick. I think in terms of quarter-to-quarter, I think the average size will move around a bit. But directionally, we're moving kind of up and to the right, and I think it's just a representation of being more strategic with customers as you mentioned, as we're integrating more and more components. In terms of where we are on that roadmap of integrations -- I mean, we've got a lot of great proof points of places where we're leveraging products across each other. Simple example is tight integrations with the collaboration and data platforms into more enterprise mobility, creating unique competitive differentiation and really just usefulness for our end customers. In terms of the enterprise products -- I mean, that's a continuum that I don't think we'll ever get off of. And maybe ask Sudhakar to provide a little bit more granularity in terms of kind of where the focal points are and how we're thinking about that over the balance of '14.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Absolutely. So this is going to be an ongoing effort on our side to integrate our products more effectively, as well as continue to inter-operate with our ecosystem on a broader basis. So we have developed a series of plans, I would say, across the book. One is to just look at it from the standpoint of automating a lot of our deployments, integrating our product in that sense such that on-boarding a customer becomes incredibly easy. So we -- that's been a lot of focus for our XenApp, XenDesktop product lines, as well as our mobile platforms groups. We are also doing a lot of cross product integration, some of which David alluded to. But increasingly, we see NetScaler being integrated across mobile deployments, as well as across XenApp and XenDesktop on deployments. Our goal is to continue to focus on this to provide better experiences, both from an administrator perspective, as well as from an end-user perspective. So a lot of the comments that I made earlier about integrating Windows apps, SaaS apps and mobile apps and delivering consistent experiences, that is one level of integration that we are undertaking at this point in time. Another level of integration is from an administrator standpoint to provide them better ways of configuring our products, creating visibility into how our products are performing, giving them user-level insights and analytics. So like David mentioned, this is a journey that we embarked on. We have already covered some portion of the journey, and we continue to build on our roadmaps as we move forward.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And, David, just one more question for you. On the -- I think you said there was a $10 million restructuring charge in the quarter and you expected there to be more, I think you said in Q2. But I thought you said something about GAAP. G&A was up quite a bit in the quarter. Was that $10 million in the non-GAAP numbers? And should we expect that again this next quarter?","David James Henshall","No. The $10 million is only in the GAAP numbers. And in the Q2 time frame, that should be a similar but smaller charge.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","What was in the Q1 number? It looked abnormally high.","David James Henshall","Well, a number of things, implementation of capital projects that had been delayed last year, things that start hitting the overall books. I mean, that's the biggest one. We're building out capital and data centers in various places, but nothing extraordinary on that front. The increase in legal fees, things like that, but nothing I would call out as material to the business.","Operator","And your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Quick one. So AWS with their desktop on demand is out now for a bit. Can you talk a little bit of what you see in terms of impact on competition? And I guess, VMware has something out as well. Just kind of how is that shaping up for you?","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So AWS has launched its desktop as a service. From an impact and a competition standpoint with our existing customers, frankly, we haven't seen a whole lot of it. If I were to segment our customers as enterprise and SMB customers, for instance, many of our enterprise customers are looking at the cloud and DaaS as an extension of their premise-based deployment. They're asking us for capabilities such as how do I burst into the cloud? How do I deliver business continuity while preserving the exact same capabilities and experiences that they get on-premise? This is what we call hybrid cloud provisioning, and this is a capability that was delivered with our XenApp and XenDesktop releases in Q1. And so we are already in engagement with the customers to be able to provide those capabilities. Now as it relates to our small and medium customers, and you heard David talk about how our Citrix service provider channel is gaining -- increasing traction in delivering desktop-as-a-service what, they're looking for is not just plain, vanilla desktops that you get out of a AWS-type service, but taking those desktops as a starting point and adding critical capabilities, both horizontal and vertical, and doing it in a manner that is specific to our end customer, which is what many of our CSP partners are doing. And that's what's driving value into the SMB channel. So we feel we have a very strong play for both segments. The enterprise on one hand is our hybrid cloud provisioning capabilities, as well as the SMB through our CSP channels. And that will continue to be a motion going forward for us.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Perfect. And one quick question. I know you don't bring out NetScaler now, any more standalone, but if I'll think about the 13% growth in cloud when you obviously had like some massive comp numbers that you had to go against here, how do you feel about competition? I think F5 just came out with like 22% product growth. Is that kind of show I think in the second half and comps are getting easier that we kind of see a clearer number there? Or is there anything that we should kind of be aware of?","David James Henshall","No, Raimo, I'd say nothing specifically. I mean, I haven't seen any detail on their business. But I mean, we've obviously been really focused on the broader, will call the NetScaler business for all the dimensions that I talked about in the last few quarters, that's everything from just expanding our coverage so that we can service more accounts, traditional ADC-type opportunities, selling into some of the largest clouds and Internet service providers, which has always been a strength of ours, as well as just driving deeper integrations. And Sudhakar talked about it a minute ago, where this isn't just an attach or a cross-sale opportunity per se. But really, the accretive value of the system is where a lot of strategic differentiation comes from. And so that's where the 1 plus 1 equals something broader than that. And we can do things by being able to manage both layer 4 7 networking, as well as the higher layers of applications and, in some cases, mobile to really optimize a complete solution. And so that -- it's really all of the above that we're pushing on right now. And then, of course, just continued strong relationship with Cisco, including joint go-to-market opportunities, lots of Cisco-validated designs, I think we have 10 of them now, and some pretty interesting and unique new things we're doing with the RISE infrastructure. So multifaceted.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I have a question for Mark. It's good to hear you on the call. As you look forward to -- toward the role of the new CEO, I was curious as to what your priorities are going to be until your successor is named?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks, Ed. Good to hear your voice, too, and that really applies to everyone. I've got to say, it's really great to be back. I did in fact start back on February 3 as promised, and the first upside surprise is that my badge still worked when I got to the office. But I've really been inspired by being back. And as I think about my priorities, it'd sort of be just a few things. First, it's staying all in until we do name a successor. And this is my 19th year with Citrix. And I have love and dedication to this company that's beyond a job. And I'm here hands-on, seeing customers, seeing partners, working with the team and propagating our ideas on not only what we do but how we do it. The second big priority that I've been focused on is helping to align our products and go-to-market machinery better so that we get more efficient and more competitive. Obviously, we're taking a number of direct shots from competitors, and part of the reason is we're in hot markets and our vision around mobile and cloud has now become the vision of others. So I'm trying to make sure that we're aligning products and go-to-market where we have a sensible advantage so that we can continue to drive growth and profitability and leverage in the way we have for so many years. And the third big area that's a priority for me, and has been since the day I got back, was to refine our vision. The fact of the matter is, the landscape is moving more rapidly and evolving more quickly than ever. And the trick in having a vision is to articulate how you had increasing relevance in the landscape that you see. So this really gets back to some of the things that -- some of the questions that have come up regarding our portfolio; where we invest more; where we invest less; integrations, both at the tactical and the strategic level; and how to use the whole notion of product design as a differentiator for the company so that -- because that's more and more where the battle line will be drawn, I believe, in the future. So those are a few things that I'm heavily focused on, hands-on, and enjoying working with this great team. And I think you'll see some of this more specifically at Synergy when we roll out some exciting new things.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Great. And just a quick follow-up for Sudhakar. Following the ByteMobile acquisition, you've been focused on building out the carrier vertical. And if you could just provide a -- just a pulse check on how those efforts have been proceeding.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So we continue to make progress obviously. ByteMobile was used as, call it, entr\u00e9e into the service provider space. But I want to highlight that our portfolio for a service provider is much broader than just ByteMobile. For instance, we have been increasingly adding capabilities into the NetScaler product line to get into the service provider segment. Our CloudPlatform forms the basis of infrastructure as a service delivery for a large number of service providers and many Tier 1 service providers worldwide. So we've been continuing to build on our capabilities. Our long-term play there is to not only extend these capabilities and gain traction, but also to support the communication service providers as they evolve into delivering more network function virtualization, which is one of the key trends, as you know, in the service provider space. And we believe we have all of the assets, starting from hypervisors all the way up to actual workloads that get delivered from these service providers. So our strategy continues to evolve with a growing set of products and solutions and go-to-market motions for the service providers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry if by chance this was asked before, but can you talk a little bit about the channel go-to-market strategy? It seems as if you've been increasing the focus in investment on channel. And how is that balancing with what had been the move towards integrators and larger resellers a few years ago?","David James Henshall","Yes, Michael, it's David. I think we're addressing both. I don't think we've ever backed away from anyone in particular. SIs are an important channel partner because that's really who a lot of our large customers turn to when they're looking at the broader infrastructure. So we've had a big focus on building up that skill set over the last many years. We're doing really well there. I mean, the SI business is up year-on-year. We've got a lot of good traction from the same folks that we have in the past, IBM, HP, Fujitsu and others, to really just driving value and not only against our solutions but against a broader transformation that the customer is trying to engage in. In terms of our traditional go-to-market engine, I mean, we're very focused on that and have been for some time. And the things that I referenced earlier is needing to ramp the capabilities around networking, that's a work in process; ramp the new capabilities around mobile, and that's just simply because it's new; and then of course reengaging partners with app virtualization and continuing to extend desktop virtualization. So multifaceted relationship with those partners, but we are certainly looking to invest in all aspects of it.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And forgive me again if it was covered, but did you comment on how the go-to-market with Cisco was doing?","David James Henshall","No, we didn't specifically. I mean, it's going well. It has been going well. We're driving lots of joint business, both in terms of desktop virtualization. In total, I think we now have 10, maybe 12, Sudhakar, Cisco-validated designs? So we're working across both go-to-market. Lots of work on the product side to drive deeper integration, and we talked about some of those earlier. From a pipeline standpoint, we continue to manage well north of $100 million in joint pipeline with Cisco, so it's good. It's a very, very good partner and we enjoy working with them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So at about the same time that you launched the XenApp 7.5, VMware came out with their new product in this space. And while I realize this call is certainly not a forum for a rival product comparison as we all look to evaluate the trajectory of VMware in this XenApp-like space, I'm wondering if you could just leave us with the 2 or 3 things that you would highlight as the key XenApp differentiators from VMware's new product.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","Sure. Happy to do that. This is Sudhakar, by the way. First of all, I just want to highlight that Horizon 6, which VMware announced, is not yet shipping. So we really don't have the true capabilities, only advertised capabilities at this point in time. That being said, as you know, we've been innovating in and improving the times of application delivery for the better part of 25 years. And there are many aspects to delivering applications securely and scalably, but I'm just going to give you a few quick nuggets on some of the key things that are necessary to deliver broad capabilities. For instance, delivering universal printing capability at the end user level is extremely important to deliver essentially native experiences in a hosted end-market. Likewise, application migration and remediation is an extremely critical capability as well, because part of why customers deploy applications such as XenApp is because of the breadth and the diversity of applications. So capabilities such as the ones that we deliver with what we call the AppDNA product, which is integral to our XenApp product, is extremely important. Another aspect is having deep and broad relationships with ISPs who are focused on key verticals, working alongside them in building applications, optimizing them and so on and so forth. And last but not least is delivering experiences across desktops and mobile, optimizing for voice and video-rich capabilities such us what we bring to HDX. So it's not just about a release with app delivery capabilities but optimizing across all of these dimensions. That is what customers look for, and that's what we have to offer. So that's why I continue to believe we have a significant differentiation and a runway in the XenApp space.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","David, I know you're fairly excited about XenApp 7.5, and many of your customers were clamoring for a product refresh there. But could 7.5 potentially cause some near-term migration issues along the lines of you saw last year with XenDesktop v7?","David James Henshall","I'm going to let Sudhakar talk about the migration and the roadmap for XenApp.","Sudhakar Ramakrishna","So the first areas that we focused on as it relates to the XenApp release was initiatives providing cloud support through hybrid capabilities, extending our capabilities on delivering better mobile experiences and also video delivery experiences. So there's a class of customers that have been asking for those capabilities that we are able to serve with what we already delivered. But a key area of focus for us going forward into 2014 is to provide migration tools that seamlessly and effortlessly allow our customers to migrate to the new versions of XenApp 7.5, thereby not incurring long upgrade cycles but yet enjoying the benefits of the new features that we've added. Another key highlight that I want to highlight or accentuate there is the architecture for XenApp 7.5 is identical to XenDesktop 7.5. Therefore, it allows our customers to essentially use the same infrastructure or better yet, optimize their deployments much more effectively and do desktop virtualization on one hand or app virtualization on the other hand and have a lot more elasticity, so to speak, in terms of how they leverage their assets.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on the share repurchase authorization. And I realize you're restricted from providing specificity, but given what is a fairly depressed stock price, can you say at a high level whether the ASR will be a material component of that plan?","David James Henshall","I can't yet. I can't give a lot of details on that, but we will be talking about that in great detail at the May 6 financial analyst meeting.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Many of them have been answered already, so let me drill on a couple of quick items. Can you give us a sense of the response you're getting to the relaunch of XenApp from both the clients and the partners? Obviously, it wasn't much of an effect this quarter on revenue. But given the initial results, conversations, et cetera, how should we think about the pickup from both sides?","David James Henshall","Yes. This is David. Let me take that. I think it's very early. There was certainly some confusion around XenApp as a product line and the direction of that last year, whether that product was being deemphasized or discontinued, many other rumors about that. Some driven by Citrix, frankly, and some driven by competitors. And so where we are right now is just reasserting our leadership across app virtualization, which is an increasingly important component to delivering mobile work-styles to mobile devices, I'd say. And so we're doing that with the launch of 7.5, as well as a really rapid product development roadmap. And so we'll be talking more about that at Synergy. Keeping expectations very, very light right now until we get a couple of quarters of actuals under our belt. That's probably the way I'd say to think about it in the short term.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And second, on NetScaler, you've given a little color in the past on this. Was this stronger on the enterprise side or the cloud or equal? How is that trade-off that occurs? It shouldn't be a trade-off, but that relationship that occurs?","David James Henshall","Sure, Mark. I mean, it's always stronger on the enterprise side. I mean, that's generally the larger segment. What we call kind of cloud or telco segment is anywhere from 35% down to probably 20% to 25% of the mix. It wasn't closer to the higher end of that, that range this period, but we saw growth across both segments.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","No huge, large deployments in the cloud side that we should be cognizant of?","David James Henshall","Well, it depends on your definition. I mean, there are always multimillion dollar deals that are going into cloud service providers. In some quarters, there are many of them. Like this quarter, there were several as well. So that is to a handful of names. It's the same dozen or so big, big data center build-outs. And fortunately, we're selling into those in just about every quarter these days.","Operator","Your next question comes from Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","David, you talked a little bit about the Cisco relationship. Maybe can you give us a little more color on -- should we expect that contribution to accelerate from here as we go into the next few quarters? And what type of ramp up should we see there? And secondly, you call for stabilization of gross margin in 2015. Should we expect the product mix to stabilize and thus, the gross margin to stabilize? Or product mix should continue to kind of favor networking group, but it's the individual business segments' margin improvement should help us see that stabilization?","David James Henshall","Sure. Let me take the second part of that first. In terms of gross margins, really a couple of things. One is the re-acceleration of our software businesses. And as everyone knows, those carry gross margins that are approaching 100%. And on the other side, we are slowly reaching the gross level of our networking business which tends to run in the mid- to high 70s. And obviously, on the virtual component, that has margins that look much more like software. So the -- regardless of the mix, we're kind of coming down towards that level where the decline is slowing pretty materially. Obviously, if we're able to accelerate growth in the traditional software-based businesses, we can impact that much more directly. But as it stands right now, looking at 2015 is a time where it starts to plateau better. In terms of Cisco, we didn't provide a lot of specific commentary around that. Continues to be a very good, positive relationship across both product development and go-to-market. I think we're happy with where we are. We're driving lots of business on the go-to-market side. I think that you're seeing an increasing volume of announcements around product level integrations. Those are important because both companies are focused on customers, and making it really easy for customers to adopt infrastructure in a way that removes as much complexity as possible. So that's where I'd say we're focused, and we'll be talking about it each and every quarter, both in terms of product announcements and go-to-market. But gradually, higher and higher contribution, but I wouldn't expect any material change just on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Your comments on the CSP or Desktop-as-a-Service business were positive. Are you making -- is that an area of focus? Are you making incremental investments there? And I guess specifically, are there any external factors that you think could change such as Microsoft changing SPLA licensing rules? Or anything else that you anticipate could change the dynamics in that market over the next 12 to 18 months?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, this is Mark. I think we are making a number of incremental investments to help service providers onboard customers more quickly and build out systems that can handle rich apps and a wider diversity of applications and desktops and to generally grow that business not only in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 service providers but much, much more focus on Tier 1. So that would be the first area of investment and -- from our part. Secondly, Microsoft obviously is hugely behind building their platform around Azure on a global basis. And workloads like data, such as our ShareFile service, as well as desktop and app delivery are huge potentials for consumption of the Azure platform. And I think that as Microsoft sees these kinds of workloads as a great opportunity, I think there's great opportunity for them to optimize their licensing more and more and more to make it easier and easier for customers to leverage the Azure platform. Obviously, as a long, long time Microsoft partner, we're working pretty closely with them on that front so that Azure can be a spectacular platform for desktop-as-a-service and for delivering rich apps as a service as well. So that's how we're thinking about it, and we think that Microsoft will more and more enable this as a way of building the consumption of Azure capacity.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's really helpful, Mark. And maybe just one quick follow-up, David. Just curious, in Q1, obviously your share buyback was low, although that's going to change here. Was there any specific reason why it was low in Q1? Any technical reasons? Anything to do with the convert? Anything specific?","David James Henshall","Yes. Specifically, we were evaluating overall capital strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets.","James Moore - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is Jim Moore in for Dan Ives. Just on the large deal front, you guys had a pretty good quarter there and had a couple on the mobile side. So just kind of curious as to where you see these large deals going on the mobile side? And you've talked about the sales force and the work you're doing there. I guess how are they going to be able to handle larger deals like these?","David James Henshall","Yes, Jim. March transactions, they came across all product lines. I mean, we had a number from networking, a bunch from app and desktop virtualization, and then I called out a couple that were mobile-only. It's probably worth pointing out that in some of those other transactions, there were components of mobile that were included in that, but I just referenced the greater than $1 million mobile-only one. So -- I mean, these are capabilities that we talked about earlier that we're building out internally to make sure that we've got professional services that can help customers through the most appropriate architecture, building out whatever data center infrastructure they need and then, of course, managing and scaling. Fortunately, most of those technologies or skill sets, let's say, already exist in our traditional channel partner. The most complex part of that, of course, is related to the virtualization, if they're layering that in this part of the solution and in how they're configuring and managing the network infrastructure at the same time. So the overall solution is where we tend to be more hands-on as a company with our own resource, as well as from SI. If it's pure standalone mobile, I think those are capabilities that a lot of our partners are already in a position where they can execute on.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions-and-answers. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","David James Henshall","All right. Thank you. So we're helping customers embrace mobile work-styles. We're mobilizing apps, data and people, all powered by Citrix cloud infrastructure and services. And as I said earlier, we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in several parts of the overall business, and we're very confident we have the right strategies, solutions and focus for 2014.","So thanks again to everyone for joining the call and look forward to speaking with everyone at our upcoming financial analyst meeting on May 6.

David?","David Henshall","Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. I want to spend most of the time on today's call talking about our business transformation and multiyear financial goals. As you know our transition to a subscription model is starting to accelerate and were seeing the early impacts on our financial results. Today we want to walk you through how we plan to drive this move over the next several years. The financial outcomes and the metrics to measure our progress along this journey.","Before we dig into that however let me take a few minutes to provide some brief color on our Q3 results and expectations for Q4. Our standard and deck including quantitative metrics has been posted to our investor relations. Mark Coyle, our Interim CFO is also here with me for the Q&A session.","Overall, I'm pleased with our results for the third quarter. Our team has shown great focus executing despite all the changes we are driving within the company to set us off for the next few years. I've settled my view on Q3 simply as total revenue in line with expectations, accelerating and subscription revenue as the new model to begins impact the P&L and expenses that are back on track driving higher profitability.","All in total revenue was up 3% year-on-year, this included subscription revenue which as I mentioned continued to accelerate growing 30% to 81 million in the quarter. The mix of annual subscriptions bookings to total product bookings was 19% in the quarter, up from 12% a year ago. And as we've discussed last quarter the growth in the underlying business has been several percentage points higher than the reported revenue this year due to this increased in the subscription mix.","Just couple of things worth noting within product revenue. First, work space services decided to accelerate. Overall revenue in this business was up 5% with perpetual license increasing 3% however the real drivers coming from SaaS as the contribution of Citrix Cloud bookings are beginning to be material without this increase the overall growth rates. However, networking continues to be a mix bag. Then a hyper-scale cloud segment of our business, which we refer to you as SSP remains pretty volatile quarter-to-quarter. In Q3, product bookings for SSPs decline more than 40% from last year. Well our non-SSP business the one that we refer to as the enterprise segment saw product bookings increase by over 10% in Q3. This is due to increased go to market coverage and competitive takeouts.","Operationally Q3 was strong, adjusted op margin rose to 32% an increase of nearly 550 basis points sequentially and tax flow from operation was up 7% from Q3 last year.","We\u2019ve started the process of rebalancing resources and freeing up capital to invest in those areas necessary to accelerate our business transformation and our multi-year financial plan.","And finally, in Q3 we introduced Mark Ferrer is our new Chief Revenue Officer, joining us from SAP where he spent the last six years helping drive their transition towards subscriptions in cloud services.","Looking at Q4, we feel good about the outlook and the opportunity pipeline and consistent with the last couple of quarters, we expect that customers will continue adopting subscription services for Citrix Cloud, both in hybrid and SaaS models. With this and the strength of Q3 we are increasing our full year guidance to include revenue between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.79 to $4.81 per share.","Now let\u2019s talk about our business transformation and our multiyear financial plan. Citrix is transitioning to a new model because it makes business sense for the company its being driven by our customers and we\u2019ll create a stronger operating model. It's important to understand the complete context for this move, so today I\u2019d like to provide you with an overview of our strategic opportunity, the benefits to Citrix and our customers, improved financial reporting to really help you understand our business and our financial targets as we exit 2020.","In addition to the materials we\u2019ll walk you today on this call, a more detailed slide deck will be posted to our Investor Relations website.","So, to understand the context behind our strategy, you need to step back and look at the infrastructure from a customer's point of view. They are adopting cloud services and SaaS applications on a broad basis. Many of our customers are juggling multiple cloud providers and dozens of new SaaS apps, yet over 90% of organizations expect that they will still have the majority of workloads running on prem for five years.","When you combine this increased complexity with mobility and the new work styles it\u2019s a fragmented user experience provides an increase in security risks and most IT teams are just struggling to keep up. For these reasons the customers have been driving our evolution, they are looking to operate a multi cloud hybrid cloud world. These challenges require a new approach and create this opportunity for Citrix to provide simple, secure and unified solutions, helping our customers address these challenges and simplify the roadmap.","Keeping this in mind, we see three strategy motions, driving our opportunity for revenue growth. First, we\u2019re building cloud services across our entire portfolio to address the fastest growing part of our \u2013 accelerating that delivery of our own innovation and simplifying customers adoption.","Next, unifying our point product technologies into a secure digital work space both on premise and in the cloud for an integrated end user experience and simplified tool for IT. And third, we are unpacking many of our networking capabilities into a secure digital parameter, to be delivered as a cloud service, for reliable and secure app delivery across an extended surface area.","With this strategy, we expect to expand our total addressable market by more than 35% overtime. We feel confident in our strategy for several reasons, most importantly of which is that this was what we are hearing from our customers. In fact, a recent ESG study of nearly 1,000 Citrix customers found that two thirds of the U.S. are a cornerstone of their security initiatives providing secure access and control.","We also have an added advantage over point product providers because of our install base of hundreds of thousands of customers 100 million end point clients our layer 437 networking and nearly 2 billion documents shared per year. All in this puts us in the direct path of user device networking and content traffic to help optimize, secure detect and correct tissues before they become a problem in customer environments.","And the Citrix Cloud mix the delivery of these benefits much, much easier. What we are doing is providing an integrated approach for administration, identity, authentication, provision and management. Citrix is hosting the management layer while the customers gets the choice where to run the workload from any clouds or from any on premise datacenter. We integrate the administration and control across all of these environments allowing them to embrace the hybrid-cloud architecture, while reducing their need for specialized IT skills. Inevitably this leads the faster innovation, greater control in a lower cost of ownership.","So now let's look at the economics of the subscriptions and why this ultimately drives customer value. Moving to a subscription model provides significant economic benefits for Citrix. The model increases customer lifetime value while the new cloud services expand our use case opportunity. Expanding these to Citrix to secure and deliver a broader range of applications including SaaS and web apps. This should increase the number of fees and usage of our products overtime.","In addition to that as an integrated suite the Citrix workspace service automatically attaches to our networking and content collaboration products. For customers the goal is to reduce PTO is the access and new innovation and simplify their infrastructure while increasing security and off course the flexibility and confidence to pursue hybrid multi cloud strategies. If you step back and look at the impact of this model on our financial statements the shift should really only have moderate financial headwinds. Currently our business is about 70% coming from recurring sources. Our non-ratable revenue to remain in 30% is made up of perpetual licenses of workspace services and networking. We expect that most of the non-ratable revenue will move to recurring over time as licenses are sold under the new model.","Financially, subscription transition provides an opportunity for us to increase revenue from both new and installed base sources. The financial opportunity is pretty straight forward, when you look at it from a unit economics point of view of a new cloud customer as well as occur installed base customers adopting Citrix Cloud subscriptions. In each case the customer can consume Citrix Cloud s either SaaS or a hybrid cloud offering the ladder of giving them the choice between the two.","First, for new licenses current pricing shows an average 2.5-year breakeven point as compared to the cost of purchasing perpetual license and maintenance creating an increase in life time value by year of three of beyond.","Next you can see an example of the shift for existing installed base customers moving from maintenance to cloud. While still only small sample size, we've seen an average 42% price uplift as customers have converted so far for the purpose of our planning reduce a more conservative assumption our modeling and assume only a 33% price increase overtime on conversions from our CSS offering. Understand the customers are moving to cloud really at their own pace and the transition allows for hybrid rights which affords optionality to migrate to this Citrix Cloud platform over the term of the contract.","We are hearing good feedback from early adopters, for example from customers that have been running older versions of our product, the move to Citrix Cloud has provided the opportunity to benefit from all the new versions and updates, without the cost and complexity of a normal upgrade cycle.","Additionally, we have customers reporting consecutive quarters of reduced operating cost, post transition. Specifically looking at our large install base, there is really two opportunities in process that should increase recurring revenue. In addition to the Citrix Cloud move that\u2013 we just discussed, were also still migrating existing workspace services maintenance customers to our upgraded support offerings customer success services, or as we refer to it as CSS. This would be completed during fiscal year 2019.","CSS is really important as it provides a significant increase in customer value including proactive monitoring, analytics, expert guidance, cloud migration tools, unlimited support and access to product updates. As a reminder for everyone, CSS is priced at 25% of original product license costs for annual subscription, versus just 15% to 18% for our older license update programs.","As we previewed at our Analyst meeting, we will be introducing adjustments to our revenue reporting as well as new metrics, so you can better understand the businesses as we move through this shift, including a subscription revenue ARR, annualize subscription mix as a percent of product bookings and deferred and unbilled revenue. We have already posted historical financials in this format to our Investor Relations website, so you can build the bridge.","While we are introducing these new metrics, the transition of our workspace service and networking business is actually going to cross us for several quarters. We are now starting to see the impact in the P&L with subscription revenue accelerating since Q1. In fact, subscription ARR in Q3 was north of $320 million up 30% from the prior year. Driving this as is the increased mix of annualized subscription bookings in the workspace service and networking business as percent of total product, steadily climbing to almost 20% last quarter.","As we look forward, we are approaching the transition holistically, and have identified four business initiatives that we expect to drive customer and shareholder value and we have set goals for each one, to better understand how we are thinking about the shape of the business in a few years.","First is the move to a subscription model driving value through more predictable recurring revenue while increasing customer lifetime value. We are targeting to exit 2020 with at least 40% of total revenue coming from subscription.","Next is the delivery of Citrix Cloud, not only does this increase our addressable market opportunity and accelerate the pace of our innovation delivery but these services drive real customer value, by reducing complexity, TCO and providing a platform to ease the adoption of new Citrix services. We are targeting more than 60% of new bookings coming from Citrix Cloud subscription in three years.","Third item is our commitment to a balance an efficient financial model. It's in 2020, we are targeting revenue growth of greater than 4% trending upwards while adjusted operating margins at the least 33%.","And finally, as we move through the transition, we plan to continue to return significant capital to our shareholders, our current plan is to return 2 billion of capital between now and the end of the 2018. So, let\u2019s take a closer look for a moment at the pace of our transition and how it will impact revenue growth rate.","As I mentioned we are targeting an overall growth rate of more than 4% exiting 2020. And as expected as we move to a subscription model and we recognize more revenue on our ratable basis, we'll see a temporary decline in revenue growth rate and profitability as we have this year. However, as revenue growth should reaccelerate in 2019 and beyond due to the compounding of prior ratable bookings, growth of new customers and the CSS maintenance price increase. Ultimately the ultimate pace of adoption will drive how quickly we reach these levels.","As the model changes you are going to see a rapid growth in subscription revenue where our estimate shows a compounded growth rate of more than 50% during this time frame. Partially offsetting this though will be the decline in this traditional license and maintenance model. On the operational side we maintain spending discipline while investing in innovation, customers success and the go-to-market capacity needed for long-term growth. As I've said as our revenue growth rate slows a little next year we'll expect the temporary impact and adjusted operating margin. As mentioned we are targeting to exit fiscal year '20 with adjusted op margin of at least 33%.","Finally, let's address free cash flow. In the 2020 exit rate for free cash flow will be influenced by two factors. The pace of subscription adoption and the billing terms of this contracts. In order to provide further visibility into the impact of the billing terms will be again disclosing the change in unbilled revenue staring in Q1 earnings. Through the transition in the capital return programs we're driving the business to deliver more than $7 a share of free cash flow. We expect to achieve this in the 2020 and 2021-time frame dependent upon the rate and pace of subscription bookings the final billing terms in the capital return programs.","The mix of free cash flow and unbilled revenue will depend on the average length of this customer contracts and off course the frequency of billing cycles. Transitions like ours typically take four to five years until the model normalizes and after that point you would expect to see an acceleration in free cash flow growth.","So, when we bring it all together looking at where we expect to finish 2017 and the impact on the P&L from accelerating this move to subscriptions, our preliminary view on 2018 will include revenue growth in the range of 1% to 2% over this year and adjusted operating margin of 29% to 30%. Ultimately the pace of transition is really important. It is slower than expected results could be higher than this outlook conversely if the pace is faster than we expect than revenue growth and operational profitability could be a little lower in 2018.","So really to sum it up, were happy with this plan and really happy with our result come together in the last three months. Our goal is to drive customers success and long-term value for shareholders, partners and employees. The new business model will provide visibility and drive leverage over the next several years and our innovation around Citrix Cloud will be at customers in the past that they need to a secure flexible multi cloud hybrid cloud environment that they've been asking for. We feel good about our direction in the future of Citrix we've set solid goals for 2020 and with the clear path to execute. It is an exciting time for the company and while any transition is challenging I'm confident that we're position for long-term success well under the future.","Thank you. And as always, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil Winslow ","Thanks guys for taking my question and then also very thanks for all the new metrics you gave us for modeling out this transition. Question for you David, you mentioned obviously rate and pace attractive so it's going to be important here about just next year but over the next several years, how you are thinking about going to market with this and just how that rate and pace plays out, considering that sort of up to the customer, how you are kind of thinking 2018 and beyond and what sort of incentives that you have in place well it be for the customer for the sales force et cetera than just one quick follow up to that.","David Henshall","Sure, I mean overall as you would imagine, we are working pretty quickly to make sure that we\u2019ve got a holistic approach to the transition not just on the go-to-market side, but everything inside the organization as well, so we are 100% lined up against what this [Audio Gap] nearly 20% of the mix that I talked about before and if we look to accelerate that transition some of it is just taking our foot off the break and some of it is \u2013 as normalize in that from the sales standpoint, so we will do both.","Phil Winslow ","Got it and then just a follow-up on CSS obviously, last quarter you gave us some metrics of uptick on that obviously the terms of CSS have change now, just so curious if you guys update in terms of what you saw this quarter with CSS whether it be anything from clients, any sort of change in churn versus expectations et cetera?","David Henshall","No CSS continues to move frequently, as you know we had a lot of success in Q2 we pulled in obviously some business at Q3 as well, just renewals business, we have migrated I say roughly half of the base so far, but remember of that some of these customers are multiyear step up from an ASP standpoint, so the financial impact will flow in overtime. Expect to be done with complete migration by fiscal year 2019.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Abhey Lamba","Yeah, thank you. David thanks for the additional color it was really helpful. At the Analyst Day, you had also talked about $500 million for incremental revenue from cloud migration, are we still on track to that or do you think that we should expect more given that the [executed] base as an option there?","David Henshall","It\u2019s a good question Abhey. I would encourage everybody go back and look at the chart if you haven\u2019t seen them it is part of the webcast that we posted on the websites. We have provided a lot more detail into this transition. But looking specifically at install base, my prepared remarks talked a little bit about the double half between migrating customers to CSS which is still in flight and then what we have seen so far is actually got 42% uplift of CSS for customers that are migrating Citrix Cloud subscriptions and just remind that just gives install base customers the optionality to adopt the Citrix Cloud platform or work play and the capabilities that come along with that.","So, our model that we have laid out has a lower step up, we want to be conservative on that and model about a third. So, I think the opportunity is absolutely there, we will be migrating those customers at a little bit slower pace probably than net new, net new is where we will be more aggressive but we have a plan that we are putting in place right now to give them good incentives but it is a financial step up.","Abhey Lamba","Got it thanks and the $2 million of capital return that you have laid out at the end of next year. Is it going to be primarily buybacks and are you thinking of ASR or some sort of program type of anything [indiscernible]?","David Henshall","We can't give a lot of detail at this point, but I would say that it's fair to assume it will be largely buyback.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, this is Tom now dialing in for Kirk. David, I realize this is a preliminary guide but does the ASC 606 change or does that have any impact on operating margins next year and just given expenses were kind of higher than expected in the first half of this year were a bit surprised you wouldn\u2019t see a bit more leverage next year. Would you mind just walking us through some of the pieces as it relates to operating margins going forward?","David Henshall","Sure. The simplest way to think about op margins in '18 and beyond is that we're just being conservative looking at accelerating this transition as everyone noticed when we push hard and we started driving a much greater incremental amount towards subscriptions there is a little bit of a depth into P&L as we spread out that revenue over an extended period of time before the base catches up and we get that acceleration. And so that's the way we are approaching it. We've taken the last 2.5 to 3 years to get to 20% of the mix and if we can double that in a year I think that would be probably as fast as we could go but that incremental piece is what impacts the top line and then conversely impacts the operating margin.","We step back when we look at where we are want to make sure that we've got plenty capital invested in increased sales capacity, cloud offs customers success those things are going to really drive success over the next three or four, five years. So that's probably the best way to think about it right now.","Unidentified Analyst ","Got it, and just a quick follow-up. I know you talked about the CSS offering, what kind of revenue uplift should we expect to see in your customer base and to what extent is that already embedded in your guidance?","David Henshall","Well, I think it depends how you are thinking about the install base because there is really two things just on a pure ASP uplift now it's back to buyers question and that's hundreds and millions of dollars of annualized recurring revenue that is an uplift from where we are today. I think more importantly that was when you think about what we are driving right now and the types of complexity we are trying to abstract away from a customer environment the secondary impact should really drive a broader set of used cases should allow us to increase seats under management and really expand our overall served addressable market. The latter statement though, none of that is included in our current outlook. We are being very conservative on that piece.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hey guys this is [Michael Sato] on for Rob Owens. Given the broader hacking activity we've seen over the past few months how have you seen changes in the way customers engage with you? Is security resonating more with them. And has any of that attraction coming from new logos or replacements?","David Henshall","Yes, it's a fairly broad question I would say that securities actually resonate obviously with all of our customer base it\u2019s a huge strategic priority. One other things that I mentioned in prepared remarks was a recent study that we did with the thousands Citrix customers and the vast majority of those highlighted Citrix as a critical part of their overall security framework and so that is in itself is obviously a real testament. We are setting more time with customers thinking about security holistically because when you think about a lot of what the workspace services products do and more broadly the whole digital works space it allows them to really, really thinks the way that they are approaching everything from endpoint security, identity, contextual access and contextual performance. So, there is definitely a big security wrap around in it.","When I look forward into really about the evolution of a lot networking capabilities as we embrace a perimeter approach to start bringing networking capabilities to the edge, that allows us to much more directly start trusting things that people will consider to be security specific activities, we have many of these services already embedded in side of [indiscernible] where do you see platform, but we can expose those and start delivering those standalone services everything from DDoS to firewalls, to secure gateways, to many others and those will be more directly related.","So, I\u2019d say the short answer is yes, absolutely security compliance are key drivers becoming more so and I think we have got a pretty exciting roadmap as I look into the future as well.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","On the sales side with Mark's new appointment to CRO, what is the initial areas of focus relative to the cloud transition effort and that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","David Henshall","You bet. It's great to have Mark on board, as I said earlier this is -- he brings to company a tremendous amount of deep experience both across through go-to-market and general management, spent the last six years really driving a lot of this type of transformation of SAP, so it's going to be awesome having him onboard, from the first things of course he is doing working customer back, making sure that we have got everything from our engagement model our channel programs or [cord setting] and our overall messaging and engagement really aligned in a way that resonates with customers. And so, as you could imagine, he hits the ground running and it will be and we are very exciting to have him on board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz","So, David as you noticed in your networking business did struggle again and it was versus a fairly easy comp, do you have any visibility into SSP spending on net scalar over the next couple of quarters or so?","David Henshall","Yeah, I mean it's interesting, I mean if you kind of look at that business it's pretty concentrated and I\u2019d say overall spending in hyper scale is pretty volatile just by nature. So, looking into Q4 I think it grows year-on-year because Q4 was not a huge quarter, more specifically the places that we\u2019re investing in that business that will drive long-term is around the enterprise. The things are most important to not only our overall strategy but how we\u2019re going to drive incremental revenue growth, and that sort of bulk of the market is. As I mentioned earlier we are seeing double-digit growth in Q3.","The reason is that it\u2019s a really good story, we\u2019ve had a software first approach, we got visibility to embrace hybrid cloud motion a lot of customers are asking about and then ultimately the delivery of cloud services. So, I think overall SSPs will be smaller and smaller part of the total overtime because the other is very much faster and them specific to them we are working on expanding the base to include what I guess you can call tier 2 clouds, MSPs and telecos and then just innovating really quickly to stay ahead of the ongoing live boxing that happens across normal hyper scale.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay, thank you. And then just as a follow-up. So, heading into today the [indiscernible] forecasting approximately 4% revenue growth and 31% and 32% margins for 2018 but that was off course prior to embedding any expectation of a cloud acceleration into the model. Is there any way to sort of tell us or give us a sense of what the estimated impact today is of that accelerated transition David on total revenue growth and margins in '18?","David Henshall","I guess we would have to normalize it but the business trends have been moving up into the right. If you think about being in Q3 I mean Q3 we just posted the highest revenue growth, EPS growth and out margin of all three quarters this year and Q4 being the exact same, not only the highest percentage next to subscriptions likely but accelerating total revenue growth as quickly as accelerating subscription growth EPS and off margin.","So, the fundamental trends of the business are actually really good. I mentioned earlier that probably the best way to normalize that is that if you step back and I look at the underlying bookings on a normalized ACV basis this shift to subscription has I guess underrepresented the overall growth rate of products by several percentage points this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","But just was wondering if you can share with us what you've seen in regards to churn rates as the year has progressed and as we've seen some of these programs put into place, just what's the feedback from customers. I saw the examples that you gave in the slide deck but overall where is there push back if you are getting any and again what's the risk that maybe the churn rates could actually accelerate? How do we think about modeling those?","David Henshall","Yes, Heather if I look at the churn rates overall for all types of subscription renewals they are unchanged in fact we anticipated there being a decline when we introduce CSS as the mandatory upgrade and that just hasn\u2019t been the case and we've seen a higher ASP uptick.","I think the reason behind that as if we've just been really successful in articulating the value because not only where we are moving up to a price point that frankly is right in line with the industry but we are just adding a lot more value as well as certain services to help customers in proactively managed environments, migrate to the cloud etcetera.","As we go into through Citrix Cloud I think the only push back that I have heard directly is around making sure it\u2019s not an either\/or that we are not forcing customers to move to SaaS and that's why we've mentioned a few times that this is really more of a subscription transition in the first phase and allowing customers to adopt more of a true SaaS version overtime because they are all going to have a different pace may not be their entire infrastructure but that level of flexibility so we are taking a hybrid cloud approach, this will give them optionality and really align with their owned I guess call it them to the cloud road maps.","Heather Bellini","And I just had one follow-up in just relation that what you just said about giving people the choice. If you are migrating with CSS right to the higher value programs is it going to be -- is it such where they decide two from now or five years from now that they want to start migrating more aggressively to the cloud, that still be able to just convert with that existing agreement.","David Henshall","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Keith Weiss","Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And thinking about sort of the 2020 target, particularly if we can think about the $7 in free cash flow per share, how should we think on OpEx growth underneath that. You guys hit some initiatives to rebalance and sort of custom head this year. How should we think about the pace of OpEx growth between now on certain 2020 that would get it to that $7 in free cash flow.","David Henshall","Yes, Keith, I say the way to think about our overall OpEx growth is we have got good discipline and focus back in the business model and you saw that show up in Q3 and Q4 guide as well. We will continue to invest in the business of course we are going to be investing in innovation, we are going to be investing in capacity but we\u2019re going to do it on a pretty methodical thoughtful basis.","The good news about the overall cost structure, if you think about the migrations that we have been talking about, our cloud service has not data or compute intensive, I mean most of our components are already fully multi-tenants, we are going to have a lot of leverage as we go into this and customers as I said are not really adopting the host conversions day one. So, you get a little bit of lag effect even on top of that. So, I am pretty confident we can maintain gross margins into the future as well, and then we will be growing revenue faster than we grow expenses over the period of the term.","Had a lot of areas that we\u2019re still looking to drive increased productivity, increased focus and alignment and we have taken some proactive steps already. We actually executed our structuring really part of this quarter, we did that to free up a lot of capital to reinvest in some of those things that we want to drive going forward. Of course, there is a profit element to it as well. but I think we are already well underway, we have been moving very quickly in the last three months.","Keith Weiss","Got it. And then in terms of -- there is a lot of functionality that you guys could add into the services going forward you are talking about sort of all the security functionality you could add. Will that come primarily from organic development or do you see more inorganic sort of technology tuck-ins coming into the equation, because you guys have been pretty quiet on the M&A front the last couple of years as you have been sort of the changing around the focus, will M&A pickup, as you kind of roll out these cloud services?","David Henshall","I think we will assume both, our pace and innovation has changed a lot over the last year or so what we have been doing behind scenes is really reorganizing our whole innovation engine, we have broken down all the silos of business units and aligned things against -- think of business cloud as a common platform and bring innovation to market on a weekly basis versus once or twice a year and I think in big releases. So, I feel really good about that, a fact lot of these capabilities that we can do ourselves, we will have to augment that of course with M&A, I think that\u2019s going to be an important part of going forward as well and just make sure that we are not just innovating for the future but also really bringing big chunks as needed and as appropriate for our portfolio.","Keith Weiss","Got it and then just last one. In terms of CSS migrated a bit thus far. Is there any sense you can give us of what sort of there is quarter revenue backwards from that CSS migration?","David Henshall","No Keith I actually I can't. Not sure if we really calculate it quite that way I will say it overall, we have got an uptick in ASPs but I tend to look at it on more of a bookings basis and since these are all in subscriptions type contracts you have to go back and see what impact it had in period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback from Stifel, please go ahead, your line is open.","Brad Reback ","Dave, I am not sure if I I missed or not but can you give us any commentary of what you are seeing cash flow from ops or free cash flow looks like into '18 and is it a step down given the model transition?","David Henshall","We didn\u2019t comment on '18 we are just thinking more about what the models is going to look like in 2020 and 2021 those were the stats that we gave and we are targeting north of $7 per share on a free cash flow basis and obviously that's dependent upon your billing terms and what not but just to help give really good visibility into that element what we are going to do is start disclosing unbilled revenue on a quarterly basis it's a new phenomenon for us we have typically billed everything upfront, we've started accumulated unbilled revenue just in the last three quarters it's already north of $50 million this year and it's been unreported so we will start disclosing that so I think it provides a much more accurate picture for everybody to understand that the true strength of the business as well as the impact of billing terms on cash flow.","Brad Reback ","Great, and then just one quick follow-up on the 2 billion dollars if we assume most of that's for repurchase you would assume that you exit '18 and sort of the 130 to 135 million share count seven times that gets you to about $900 million that's a right way to think about that?","David Henshall","We will be exiting 2020, that's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow. Please go ahead. Your line is open and it's from Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","David, quick question on the restructuring program that you announced. Can you talk a little bit about how that fits into the overall scheme because part of that if I look through the news flow, there was a lot of it seemed at least from a news flow, a lot of that happened around share file so I'm a little bit surprised can you give us a little bit more detail what you did, how you fit it and how it helps you in the overall margins story going forward? Thank you.","David Henshall","Yes, I would caution you to ever look too closely to any external news flows because we didn\u2019t provide any details around this and frankly there is a bunch of nonsense it was out there. So, I would tell you what we did do quickly. We started with looking at the overall portfolio, make sure that we have the right focus across our assets and we trimmed a couple of pieces that weren\u2019t just deemed to be critical to the overall strategy and then we realigned a couple of things to really make sure that that what we are doing is truly aligned with the go forward enterprise type motion.","So, the only thing that we have done in the share file business is just start to recast the focus more towards the enterprise versus SMB. Its historically we've been launching SMB types solution and the things that were really driving including deep integration with Citrix Cloud and some of the other more complete work space portfolio delivery pieces has been the only thing that we are doing there. So, it's full speed ahead with share file but a little of the shift in focus.","In terms of the overall as I mentioned this and I did it earlier what we are doing is making sure that we've got assets in the right places, we've got efficiency in the way we are development organization has laid out from a geographic standpoint. We've got the right skill set as we look forward.","So, part of that was really about freeing up capital to reinvest in those things that I think are really needed for the next few years. So, we will exit this whole restructuring process with more coded caring resources a greater mix of cloud for skills and that type of things as well as simplify the infrastructure in the few places. So, it wasn\u2019t simply a cost exercise, off course there is a cost element but it's much more forward-looking in terms of where we are going.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Please go ahead your line is open. Michael please go ahead your line open.","Michael Turits ","So, I was just wondering and then driven back and forth, so sorry if I missed anything but, it looks to me in your slide we should see increased revenue over the next couple of years during the transition. But cash flow looks like it did combine, so I am sure that because of one build on, I don\u2019t know if you walked through this but I want to make sure given that an importance of cash flow during the transition that, we know what the right metrics you really want us to focus on if we are going to see cash flow down for a couple of years?","David Henshall","Yeah Michael. I would encourage you to go back and look at the transcript and then look at all the underlying metrics because we did cover this, but just to be clear, I mean we should expect revenue growth each year through the transition just a very a very small dip in the overall growth rate of revenue in the 2018 before we get the compounded fact in some of the underlying drivers that you are seeing already and then it's an acceleration up into the right.","Cash flow, we have taken a conservative approach on cash flow right now, because the billing terms of contracts we\u2019re still waiting to see where that lands, if it lands on annual billings versus something that a little bit longer than that, that puts a bit of a temporary influence on cash flow, so what we would do to give you the appropriate visibility, we will also be disclosing unbilled revenue of each quarter. So, if you want to add that to your cash flow you get a little bit normalized view of the kind of what\u2019s going on inside the business.","Obviously, that\u2019s going to be overall impacted by the length of customer contracts and the frequency of billing, and so we will disclose enough details so everybody can see how that\u2019s moving but the underlying trends are really unchanged. I think we are seeing a very modest impact in the short term and then we expect to see a nice acceleration as we go into 2019, 2020 and beyond.","Michael Turits ","Great, and if I get one follow-up and if it has been covered, my apologies. But anything else you can tell us -- I know you talked a little bit on the security opportunity but I think you can add to anything what you have already said on that because in terms of how long we should see that transition taking around that\u2019s scale?","David Henshall","Well as we continue, I mean we already have a number of services that are being delivered via Citrix Cloud now, they are very early, I mean the first of which think about around our -- we used to call Net Scaler Mass, which is management analytics and its providing really a key differentiator frankly in that space and one of the reasons why we are continuing to [indiscernible] the expansion of that is a first step when it becomes more general analytics and security analytics. So, over the course for the next six months you will see all of our elements be providing data into that base where you can apply the right level of algorithms on top of it to give our customers a really unique insight all the way back to user behaviors, the device behaviors, how applications are performing, anomalies along the way, those can be acted on the security context.","I also talked briefly about the way a lot of these current networking services are going to be exposed as independent cloud services deployable across multiple instances and you start thinking about what we can do in that area across gateways and DDoS and firewalls and others. That\u2019s just a normal progression of this market as customers continue to move more and more workloads to the cloud. So, stay tuned we will talk more about it each and every quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pritchard Walter from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hey this is Tyler [indiscernible] for Walter Pritchard. Thanks for taking the question. David I was just hoping if you could walk us through your exit patients in 2018 for the maintenance uplift from the CSS program? Would you expect the maintenance revenue growth to accelerate from kind of level it is today and has the increase move towards subscription changed any of your assumptions there?","David Henshall","I would say I mean the way we are thinking about '18 is pretty high level at this point in time. And we haven't broken it down and guided to the individual line items. Overall, I would say, we feel good about the pipeline, we expect customers to continue to adopt these subscription services for hybrid and SaaS as well as this CSS uplift so it's all moving in the right direction. We will provide quarterly updates but at this point it's a little premature to start guiding into the individual line items.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay, and just in terms of the subscription impact does that change anything just given the higher uptick that you are seeing from customers?","David Henshall","Well, I think the subscription impact and I mentioned this earlier Tyler, is that we've got a little under 20% of the base that is consuming right now new licenses net new licenses as a subscription service and that's up from somewhere 10% to 15% last year so think about the incremental jump and the impact that that's had on revenue this year. Going into '18 we want to look at probably at doubling of that incremental amount from year-to-year that's what's causing the slow pause. As we get into that I mean there is a few moving just in terms of how many customers are on the installed base are going to want to migrate versus net new and so as we get each and every quarter we will get a little bit more detail there.","Unidentified Analyst ","And then on the new subscription kind of line item that you guys broke up that includes term licenses, is it your expectation once you adopt the ASC 606 that you are going to have to kind of separate the term licenses from that bucket given the potential that those get recognized when the deal is booked.","David Henshall","Yes, turns out of big part of what we do and we've been dialing to turn back for a while just in anticipation of 606 but for completing this we wanted to put all that together. So, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate it's been a very large amount. I don\u2019t think the revenue treatment does change under 606 but it's a small rounding error for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Phil Winslow ","Just had a one more follow-up. David to your question you were asked earlier about what are the 2020 free cash flow if I scroll down to the bottom of your slide obviously you've got that unbilled component there and if you can't co-relate that back to the revenue slide if you are earlier obviously you were calling for a sort of acceleration in the transition in '19 and '20 sort of way from license, so therefore a buildup of that unearned, so should we think about what I would call the underlying cash flow power not necessarily being seven, but obviously you are kind of adding back so to speak that green box there on top of let's call it the underlying cash power that we've actually start to see but kind of in the outer years as you guys talk about '21 and beyond sort of call way and getting backlog there?","David Henshall","Yes, Phil I think that's a great way to look at it and one of the reasons why we are going to be disclosing both because they can be influenced by doing terms and other things. So, it's appropriate for sure.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for question-and answers, I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","David Henshall","So want to say thanks again for everybody for joining us, this new business model is really going to improve our visibility and drive leverage over the next several years, it will help our innovation around Citrix Cloud and the security defined parameter, giving our customers a path that they really been asking for around a secure flexible hybrid cloud infrastructure, we feel very, very good about our direction and I think we\u2019ve got a clear path to execute, and these are very exciting time for the company, I look forward to giving you an update in three months.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Citrix Systems Fourth Quarter and 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Fleites, you may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites","Thank you, Shomaria. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call, where we will be discussing Citrix's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Financial Results.","Participating in the call will be Mark Templeton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Henshall, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Financial Officer.","This call is being webcast with a slide presentation on the Citrix Systems Investor Relations website, and the slide presentation associated with the webcast will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin the review of our financial results, I want to state that we have posted product classification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to the Investor Relations page of our website.","I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as the impact of the global economic climate, uncertainty in the IT spending environment, risks associated with our products, acquisitions and competition. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.","Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the company's filings with the SEC, including the risk factor disclosure contained in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is available from the SEC or the company's Investor Relations website.","Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I would like to turn it over to David Henshall, our Chief Financial Officer. David?","David James Henshall","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us here today. As you can see from the release, we finished off the year with great momentum across all of our businesses, delivering $619 million in total revenue, $126 million increase to deferred revenue, $170 million in cash flow from ops, and adjusted EPS of $0.78 a share.","For the full year 2011, we had record performance across all of our major metrics: total revenue was up 18% to $2.2 billion; product license revenue increased more than 20%; GAAP EPS was up 28% to $1.87; while adjusted EPS was $2.48 a share.","So we're continuing to drive leadership across desktop virtualization. We're delivering innovative new technologies in cloud networking. We're expanding the breadth of our SaaS products to facilitate changing work styles. These are all trends that can be clearly seen on our results.","So drilling into the numbers for Q4. Revenue from new license sales was $229 million, up 17% from last year, clearly led by the demand for the desktop solutions. License update revenue increased 9%, driven by Subscription Advantage renewals and a desktop Trade-up Program. Technical services increased 34%, again due to strong demand for consulting, and our Software-as-a-Service business grew 21%.","From a geographic perspective, the Americas region is executing really well, delivering a revenue growth of 16% from last year, total revenue of $278 million. The results in the geo were fairly balanced throughout Q4 with strength coming from both desktop solutions and from NetScaler. And the Americas teams also drove 31 individual transactions over $1 million each, really reflecting the more strategic engagement that we've been building with customers throughout the year.","International, the business environment was mixed in Q4, really similar to what we're seeing all year. In EMEA, revenue was up 12% to $171 million. We continue to see solid engagement with big customers at a strategic level, including a number of multiyear commitments and 14 deals greater than $1 million each. However, the demand profile was uneven across the region. And some areas showing caution initiating new capital projects.","And finally, Japan and Pacific remain our fastest growing markets, combining for a 37% total revenue growth and more than 40% growth in new product license. Strong teams in these 2 regions are continuing to post terrific numbers each quarter.","So overall, a very solid quarter to cap off a great year for Citrix. So now, let's look at the Q4 results within our 3 primary businesses.","First, our desktop solutions business, which grew 14% over last year to $369 million, including license growth of 18%. For the full year, license revenue was also up 18%, and at the top end of the range that we set for 2011.","So while we no longer break out revenue from the individual products within this business, the growth has really been led by the momentum around desktop virtualization, with XenDesktop now contributing well over half of total product revenue. For more context on the desktop solutions business in Q4, there are few metrics that I think really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value that customers are placing on desktop virtualization within their infrastructure. ","In fact, in Q4, there were $35 million plus deals for the desktop products, easily a record and representing customers from healthcare, retail, government, financial services and other verticals. Nearly $100 million of the sequential growth in deferred revenue is coming from multiyear enterprise deals, Subscription Advantage renewals and a desktop Trade-up Program. Individually, there were more than 225 BB transactions for more than 1,000 seats each. There were 40 deals for more than 5,000 seats and 10 transactions over 10,000 seats each in the quarter. And all-in, more than 2,700 new customers bought XenDesktop in Q4, an increase of more than 50% from last year.","So customers are looking at desktop transformation as a way to accelerate their business imperatives. For example, in Q4, a Fortune 100 company in the U.S., with over 80,000 employees and aggressive cost focus, buying XenDesktop and NetScaler to begin building out a foundation for mobility, Bring Your Own Device and VDIs more than 3,000 users. Or a Japanese insurance company with offices in 60 cities purchasing 30,000 XenDesktop licenses as part of a major work-life balance initiative; or a large financial services firm in Europe with nearly 20,000 retail outlets, leveraging the Trade-up Program to buy more than 100,000 XenDesktop licenses to support their Win 7 rollout plans. So we're increasingly talking to customers at this level, so the conversations move from technology to business enablement.","Some of the important investments in 2011 like VDI-in-a-box, RingCube and App-DNA allow us to provide customers the tools to more efficiently transform their desktop infrastructure, including assessment, migration and delivery of apps and Desktops as a Service to all users in the enterprise.","Next, turning to our datacenter and cloud business, total revenue was up more than 21% in the quarter to $103 million, with product revenue increasing 15%. Growth here was again led by NetScaler with license revenue up 40% year-on-year and contribution coming from a number of different areas.","First, we continue to see traction driving a cross-sell motion into enterprise account base. In Q4, in fact, we have more than 500 desktop deals, which included NetScaler as part of the solution. Next, our VPX virtual appliances growing more than 65% year-on-year and now contributing about 7% of NetScaler revenue. Third, the FTX platform continues to gain momentum with service providers and large enterprises. And finally, growth from dot com accounts that continue to build out the infrastructure to support large retail into the cloud-based service offerings.","All in, the datacenter and cloud business had a terrific year, growing 29%. And the clear stand out in 2011 was the NetScaler business, where we increased license revenue by more than 55% and significantly outpacing the market.","Looking at our Software-as-a-Service business, revenue was up 21% to $114 million. The collaboration products, which were up 29%, continue to be the primary driver and now account for over half of our total SaaS revenue. Geographically, the investments we've been making to expand internationally are delivering good results. And in Q4, revenue from international markets accounted for about 15% of the total, which is up from less than 10% 1 year ago.","And also in Q4, we launched our solution for cloud-based data named ShareFile, making it easy for businesses of all sizes to securely store, sync and share business documents and files, both inside and outside of the company.","So turning to expenses and operations. In Q4, adjusted op margin was 30%, up more than 150 basis points over last year. And included in these results is the dilution from the acquisitions that we made in the second half of 2011, as well as continued headcount growth across 2 main areas. Those areas are, first, expanding our geo -- our go-to-market reach and customer touch to enterprise account managers, consulting capacity and tech support. And second, around product innovation, to bring to market new technologies as well as improving integration of the total solution in order to drive simplicity and better end-user experience.","In total, we added 380 new people to Citrix in the fourth quarter with about half coming via acquisition. And for the full year, we hired 1,300 people, bringing year-end headcount to about 6,900.","The last item I want to mention is cost of goods sold. As we've forecasted, we've seen a slow but steady increase in COGS as a percent of revenue, and the driver behind this is simply the mix of revenue as we've diversified the business model towards higher contribution from SaaS, hardware appliances and professional services. This is a trend we expect to continue through 2012.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased to $1.5 billion as we spent roughly $150 million on M&A activity and an additional $100 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares. For the full year, we repurchased 6.5 million shares. Offsetting this was cash flow from operations, which was $170 million in the quarter, and nearly $680 million for the full year.","The other item to note on the balance sheet is deferred revenue. Deferred at the end of the year was $960 million. And in Q4, as I mentioned earlier, we added $126 million to the total deferred revenue balance, which is by far a record amount for any sequential growth. In fact, both short-term and long-term deferred increased by 23% from the prior year, really reflecting the evolution in customer engagement at a more strategic level.","And also, as I commented earlier, we had a number of ELA-style deals in Q4 where customers are initiating multiyear commitments. And based on our revenue policy, these types of transactions are often highly deferred or recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. So overall, looking at the business in total, a great Q4 and 2007 [ph]. We're executing well. We're seeing growth in all of our primary businesses and we're making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position.","So finally, I'd like to discuss our current outlook and expectations for 2012. As we enter this year, customer activity metrics and pipeline continue to be very strong. We remain focused on delivering financial results while investing to expand our long-term capacity across our main businesses, plus the new markets we entered over the past 2 quarters.","While we expect continued volatility in the demand environment, specifically at EMEA over the first half of the year, we're comfortable raising the high end of our full year revenue guidance by $30 million, based on the strength of pipeline business momentum. And given the long-term opportunity at our markets, we're currently planning to run the business with adjusted gross margin that's flat as compared to 2011, allowing us to invest in 2 primary areas. The first is go-to-market coverage, to increase our market position around the world. And the second, being in the acquisitions that we made late last year in cloud and data sharing markets. And these will include development, consulting and the product specialist teams needed to bring these products to market. So all in,   expect these businesses will be dilutive to consolidated earnings in the first half of the year as we build out capacity and then accretive by late Q3, Q4.","So for the full year 2012, our current expectations have increased to total revenue in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.51 billion, and adjusted EPS of between $2.70 to $2.74 per share. And for the first quarter of 2012, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $555 million to $565 million; adjusted tax rate of approximately 23%; and adjusted EPS of between $0.49 and $0.51.","So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you some additional details on the quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks, David. Today, I'm really pleased to report another record-breaking performance for Citrix in both revenue and profit, supported by great execution across strategy, innovation and operations.","Diversity in products and channels is driving growth, with increases in C-level engagements, SI pipelines and deal flows, up-selling end-to-end technologies and cross selling our adjacent products. You see all this in our results. Acceleration and strategic deals; use of our products as a system; and increased customer touch through technical services. All this strengthened our leadership and collaboration, desktop virtualization and cloud networking, and allowed us to make some important new investments in data sharing and cloud orchestration.","We're combining these technologies into a compelling set of solutions that power mobile work styles and cloud services to dramatically improve business productivity, efficiency and agility. We owe thanks to thousands of Citrix's customers and partners for their business, trust and enthusiasm for our vision. I'm really proud of the Citrix team for working tirelessly to accomplish all this, and at the same time, for their recognition as a top 50 best place to work. We're believers, not only in what we do, but how we do it.","Growth, amazing products, a special culture, all this is pivotal to our mission, a mission based on a deep belief that people should be able to work and play from anywhere. In the past couple of months, I've been with many customers, partners and Citrix teams worldwide. There was a big takeaway from me. And that's IT organizations are struggling at the intersection of opposing forces, the control of standardization versus the freedom of consumerization, and the legacy of distributed computing versus the flexibility of cloud services. In simple terms, they're realizing the exceptions of the PC Era, things like mobile users, personal devices, wireless access, app stores, SaaS and Cloud Infrastructure, all these have become the new assumption for the Cloud Era. We're in great position to help our customers make the difficult transition to the Cloud Era, with market-leading products to embrace consumerization and adopt cloud services.","As we look into 2012, there are 3 significant market forces shaping our plan. First, the mobility imperative; second, the enterprise cloud evolution; and third, the cloud service build-out.","So first, mobility. Mobility is fast becoming an IT imperative, driven by the use of personal devices, the economics of flex desking, mandates for workforce continuity and the quest for better productivity. And the Bring Your Own movement is just unstoppable, making device independence essential. Citrix has been a long-time innovator and pioneer in device independence and in collaboration and in mobility, enabling anywhere access to people, data and apps with 3 great products.","GoToMeeting, the fastest growing Web collaboration service in the world, creates a high-definition experience that's just like being there, with brilliant HD video, audio and coming soon, Workspaces, for easily sharing documents within project teams. ShareFile, our newest SaaS product, enables secure, easy cloud-based document sharing across all your devices, and with all your colleagues and friends. This team is ramping really well and doing a fantastic job building the foundation of our Follow-Me-Data vision.","And finally, there is Citrix Receiver that delivers self-service access to any Windows, Web or SaaS app from any device. We're now seeing around 1 million downloads of Receiver every month. And the newest releases are better than ever. They're beautifully designed, up to 40% faster, and they consume 50% less bandwidth. And soon, Receiver will also deliver the ultimate Follow Me desktops, apps and data experience through integration with ShareFile. Mobility of people, data and apps, it's driving our SaaS business and demand for our vision for the evolution of the enterprise cloud, which I'll touch on next.","The promise of cloud computing has clearly captured the imagination of CIOs and business leaders everywhere. No matter where I go, I find customers focused on making their existing datacenters more cloud-like, and exploring secure practical ways to leverage the innovation and economics of external cloud services. Our plan is to help customers drive this evolution with 3 key products.","The first is XenDesktop. If you look at any enterprise customer today, it's clear that the vast majority of their apps run on Windows. XenDesktop, with its embedded XenApp functionality, helps customers transform these apps into more flexible, secure and mobile cloud-like services, leveraging their past investments while giving them all the benefits of a cloud delivery model.","Next is our newly available CloudGateway, which sits at the front door of the datacenter and unifies the provisioning and security of Windows Web, SaaS and mobile apps through an enterprise storefront. And Cloud Bridge, sitting at the back door of datacenters, making it easy to bridge into the infinite capacity of public clouds with all the security, performance and reliability that enterprise biz require. These 3 products work in concert to help our customers manage the evolution to the Cloud Era in a secure, practical and high impact way. Leveraging our innovative desktop virtualization and cloud-convergence products, and enabling customers to tap into the enormous buildouts of cloud services, which is the third market for us I'd like to touch on.","Just yesterday, we learned that Apple's new iCloud service attracted more than 85 million users in its first 3 months. This is astounding. It's clear, we're in the midst of a huge build-out of public and consumer clouds, a build-out that will transform everything we know about computing, creating thousands of new clouds that deliver everything from business and productivity apps to collaboration, desktops, data, core infrastructure and even gaming.","Citrix is capitalizing on this historic opportunity with 3 strategic Cloud Infrastructure products. The first is NetScaler. We saw a tremendous growth in gains and share last year. Overall, our cloud networking business will continue to be one of the biggest benefactors of the Cloud Era, as providers look to deliver services with the best performance, scalability, security and economics.","Next, our Citrix CloudStack and CloudPortal. Two new strategic products from our Cloud.com acquisition last year. CloudStack helps customers create Amazon-style clouds, the way the world's largest and most innovative clouds are built. And CloudPortal makes it easy to transform those clouds into real, profitable businesses that offer infrastructure, platform and Software-as-a-Service to business customers. To date, more than 2,500 cloud providers, including 4 of the top 5 in the world, have chosen Citrix Cloud Infrastructure. Each new win in these markets puts us in a position to share in their success as they grow.","So the confluence of these market forces, 3 forces, the mobility imperative, the enterprise cloud evolution and the cloud service build-out are driving the Cloud Era, and we're perfectly aligned.","So finally, I'd like to highlight the key things you can expect from Citrix in 2012. First is intelligent integration across products, licensing and packaging, to deliver simpler, better and more competitive solutions to mobile and cloud markets.","Next, increased ROI for XenDesktop through integration of Personal vDisk technology, new HDX-on-a-chip clients and other innovations that will significantly reduce the CapEx and OpEx of desktop virtualization.","Third is greater focus on accelerating desktop transformation, including programs and services built around our new App-DNA migration tools.","Next, continued investment in go-to-market evolution, with greater focus on direct customer touch, giving us more capacity to drive strategic deals and to cross-sell networking, data sharing and collaboration.","And finally, more depth in strategic alliances to drive primary demand in mobility, desktop virtualization and cloud infrastructure markets, along with a larger mix of business from SI and service provider channels.","So this is how we're thinking about 2012 in context of our larger, multiyear business objectives and ambitions for growth.","In closing, I feel really good about our leadership in some of the hottest markets. I feel really confident about where we're investing and excited about the momentum we carry into 2012. Solutions for Bring Your Own Devices, work shifting, desktop virtualization and enterprise cloud network are at the top of every CIO's priority list, and no one is better positioned to capitalize on these than Citrix. This is how we're helping customers embrace change in business, in IT, and how people work. This end-to-end perspective and focus on mobile workstyles and cloud services are what sets Citrix apart.","And now, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question will come from the line of Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I got 2 product questions, but my first is you pretty comfortably outperformed our NetScaler and our desktop license targets in the quarter, but the total license number was a little bit lighter where consensus was. Were there any product areas in the quarter that were not where you wanted them to be?","David James Henshall","Yes, Adam, this is David. The only thing that I'd call out in the individual products would be around our win optimization. If you remember we had a very large government deal in Q4 of last year that didn't repeat in Q4 this year. And so, therefore, we just got a down -- a pretty material down year-on-year comp for that business. But besides that, everything else is looking great.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And my second question is if you drill down on the billings number for the desktop, it looked like it was up 20% on a year-on-year basis and obviously, you had a very good second half in the desktop business in general. As you look in the next year, are you -- be comfortable giving any broad ranges in terms of what that growth might be? And what the impact, if any, would be if the shift towards ELAs and more deals going into deferred?","David James Henshall","Sure, Adam. Let me take the last part of the question first. In terms of the shift towards ELAs and large deals, it's still a fairly immaterial component of the overall. It's certainly not a motion that we're driving to a large degree, but really responding to customers and where -- the way they are thinking about transactions. And they tend to come later in the year, in Q3 and Q4, when more of the big deals are concentrated. It's just that customers are looking at longer term, multiyear engagements at some level of transformation. So they're choosing not to buy on a transactional basis, which is fine, and we'll do that, but we'll call them out as appropriate, probably in Q3 and Q4, but I wouldn't anticipate it materially changing the business dynamics. In terms of the overall growth rate in the next year, I don't think it's appropriate to be breaking it into individual line items yet. It's too early in the year, but I think directionally, we certainly feel very comfortable that we'll be able to maintain or expand share, market share per category across all our strategic products, consistent with where we've been in 2011. So that's the way I think about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. First, David, I know you're not sort of specifically breaking out XenApp versus XenDesktop. But based on to your rough 50-50 math, it looks like we saw another sort of reacceleration in XenApp growth even versus Q3. And you have just in -- and Mark, a, is that true? And then, b, Mark what do you think is driving them? How do you think about sort of XenApps and XenDesktops or license growth going forward if you're seeing this reacceleration in XenApp? And then just quick question on the cost, you mentioned this increase investment in sales and marketing and service, I wonder if you could give us just a little more clarity on that especially kind of the flow of that over the course of the year?","David James Henshall","Mark, we'll take the first part of the question, then I'll follow up on the cost.","Mark B. Templeton","Phil, thanks. So what's happened over the course of the last 6 quarters is our field teams have really gotten quite good at really talking to Desktop Virtualization and the whole notion of FlexCast, which is our technologies that allow customers to optimize the delivery of desktops and apps based upon the kind of environment they have in terms of the types of exec mobility they want to provide, knowledge worker solutions and even task worker. So we're seeing that sort of very nice consultative kind of sale go on with customers now through partners, et cetera, where we're positioning and they're buying the product that suits what they're trying to accomplish. And that's been our goal all along to really drive a Desktop Virtualization message and practices in the field that allow customers to really get the best solution. So that's what we're seeing there. And I think the better that our teams articulate this, the better the overall growth will be. And we continue to be optimistic and bullish around what we can do in this marketplace, especially as we get bigger deals, bigger customer references. And the focus on FlexCast and what we've done with HDX, et cetera, continues to make a huge impact in rollouts of these solutions with customers.","David James Henshall","And regarding the go-to-market investments, I'd say there is really 3 things. In general, just overall expansion of coverage. And there's many places where we just don't have enough coverage to be able to service customers and customer demand effectively and so that will include enterprise account managers, consulting capacity and tech support. Next area is a focus on partners, and continuing to work with leverage train and sell alongside SIs and other partners to allow us to drive the strategic deals long-term. And then, the third is around the new businesses, and those are our product specialist teams, as well as some consulting and support that we'll be building up right now, and they'll take probably the first half to ramp up. That's why when we look at the new businesses, you'll see some dilution in the first half of the year and then accretive with a strong run rate as we exit 2012.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm actually going to circle back and kind of take a different variation of Adam's first question. It relates to the desktop solutions business. License revenue there grew 18% in 2011, which again was at the top end of the range. How should we think about that, maybe, as we go into 2012?","David James Henshall","Yes, Steve, kind of the way I answered Adam's question. I think it's just too early in the year for us to be talking about year-end targets, because we really don't have a good view on how the category is growing. And so that commentary is really just about category and macroeconomics. I will say that from a pipeline standpoint, both in terms of aggregate dollars and in relative coverage, we're entering the year at a record level, frankly as strong as we've ever been. We feel like our competitive position is unchanged over the past couple of quarters, and we plan to grow at least as fast as the market category over the course of 2012. So it's really more stay tuned as we move into the next couple of quarters. And we've got more granularity in terms of how the environment is playing out and certainly, specific product areas.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then, I have a product question for Mark. It just relates to the product road map. As we look at last year, you introduced the CloudGateway, the Cloud Bridge, kind of what we'll call the head end or back in the core datacenter. Is there more work in products still to be introduced back in the head end and in the datacenter around building out a more complete solution going forward?","Mark B. Templeton","Steve, I think we have actually the core brands and products that can actually serve us over the course of the next year in those areas. So as we've talked about, I mentioned again, CloudGateway this sort of front door. It provides the connection and for Citrix Receiver, and it's the unification point across all of the kinds of IT services, enabling provisioning, authentication access control, kind of all these capabilities that we think the next-generation IT organization needs there. And then the Cloud Bridge is for the back door. As far as the rest of what goes on in the private cloud, we are highly focused on making sure that enterprise customers can really build out these -- what we'd like to think of as Windows-as-a-Service desktop and app clouds, based upon XenApps and desktop technologies. And the roadmaps around those products actually reflect that. And so, those are our focal points over the next year, and the roadmaps actually add more strength and depth to those products, rather than adding new pieces at the top level.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask on the margin front. Given your guidance, I think it implies roughly 2 years of flat margins here. So how do we think about in terms of -- if there is revenue upside, will that flow through? I'm guessing there's not further acquisitions in the guidance, so that could provide a drag. And just how, in general, should we think about margin expansion moving forward?","David James Henshall","Rob, I think in general, we're maintaining a consistent position to where we've been over the last few quarters. And that is that this is a market where we see tremendous opportunity over the next few years, and therefore it's incumbent upon us to make sure we've got the right level of technology set, as well as market coverage and ways to support customers long term. So that's where the bias has been, and you've seen the results as the growth has accelerated over the last few years. And we see that, that really continuing into the future. As far as the commentary about specific numbers around margin, that's more of a business model discussion in terms of how we're thinking about the shape of our investment. So flat to 2011, which takes you into the low 26 range is the way to model it at this point. And as we go through the year and we're able to hopefully outperform on the top line, some portion of that will flow through to the bottom line in terms of just higher EPS and higher margin expansion. We're certainly not -- we're not operating down to that target per se. As far as additional M&A, and this is -- I think what's embedded in your question is that we've been fairly acquisitive over the course of the last 6 quarters. We did 7 individual transactions in 2011. I think as we look forward, we're in an environment right now that is very rich in terms of great small product technologies, things that can allow us to accelerate our roadmap, et cetera. So yes, we'll continue to be acquisitive, but I think our bias would be towards smaller product features, things. I think it's safe to say that in the short term, I don't see anything that would be not already anticipated in our business model.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And as you look at the go-to-market strategy for the desktop business, can you talk about specifically your systems integrator relationship and just where you guys are tracking there?","David James Henshall","Sure. I think SIs are continuing to be a very important part of the story. It's always a work in process. Each quarter gets a little bit better. We keep focus on training and bringing these guys along. And Q4 specifically, contributed about 12% to 15% of total product bookings where deals were fulfilled by strategic SIs. That's up -- actually the aggregate dollars are up about 18% to 20% year-on-year, with the primary contributors being EDS, IBM, Fujitsu.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about where we are in terms of ROI benchmarks for XenDesktop. And where do you think this needs to be in order to see a reacceleration in growth given the relatively low penetration rates of Desktop Virtualization overall? And I guess, if it's not ROI, what do you think is causing or, I guess, impeding the reacceleration of this business?","Mark B. Templeton","Hey Heather, thanks for the question. So a couple things. First, the business is accelerating and we're very delighted with the performance of it. I think that the single ROI drag has really been on the VDI sort of front, and we've made a tremendous amount of progress over the last 6 quarters in actually reducing the CapEx and OpEx on the VDI component. When you take all of these FlexCast models into account, from completely hosting a virtual app to a VDI-style desktop to streaming a desktop or an app to an endpoint, the total ROI on Desktop Virtualization is quite strong with paybacks in under 12 months, which has really been a driver of our business for a long, long time. So I think that the goal here is to continue to bring the VDI piece down to raise the overall ROI on Desktop Virtualization and make it a lot more consumable across the board. And then, I think that the rest of it is really in the hands of partners, customers and our ability to drive primary demand capacity to deliver technical services to really drive the desktop transformation process. We get some help from like the Windows 7 migration, of course, and now the prospects of a great Windows 8. So we get some tailwinds there. But I think a lot of this is execution and customers' ability to make capital investments, which there's -- frankly, there is an ebb and flow, too, I think as we see in terms of the overall economic environment.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess my view of XenApp license was flat in the second half, roughly speaking, then XenDesktop license was up a little bit better than 40% year-on-year, which -- that was my comment on deceleration. It just looks like over the last few quarters, the trend had been decelerating and it just seems like such a big market opportunity that we should be seeing an inflection at some point.","Mark B. Templeton","Okay.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe I'm not thinking about it the right way so...","Mark B. Templeton","Yes. The way we think about it is -- and sort of the state of the market is sort of transactions, reorder rates and acceleration in new customers, et cetera, and all -- accelerating. That's the way we think about it from a market point of view. I understand why you said that now.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Services line has been growing very well, and you've been adding consultants. Can you give us any sense of sort of when you sell XenDesktop, what ratio of that is services revenue vis-\u00e0-vis product revenue?","David James Henshall","There's not a ratio I think that holds true. It's on a case-by-case basis. There is -- and you can assume that in a large transaction, we've got a full-time consultant, at least one, working hand-in-hand with that customer for some period of time. I think overall, when I look at the services line, you're right. It's been growing great over the past couple of years really, and just a function of our ability to bring on new heads. And this is representative of the more strategic nature that we're engaged at right now, selling desktop transformation to customers and making sure that they are successful, not only in the design, implementation, migration, et cetera, but also on the back end, when it comes to post-sales support and have long-term success. And so, those have been areas that we've invested in across the board. As much as I didn't want to call out individual line items for 2012, I think that the way to think about that is a decelerating growth in services as we plan right now, and that's just a function of people. Obviously, if we're able to find and attract more capacity on that level, that growth rate will pick up throughout the year as well.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right. And I guess, David, if you could just also provide a little color, so how does that then work with the SI? I mean, obviously, they want to provider services. So how does that relationship -- and with the customer and the Citrix's consultants and the SIs play out? Just a little understanding, that would be helpful.","David James Henshall","I guess, say, overall, I mean, we still provide a fairly limited amount of the aggregate service that is customer-facing. And that's true for, historically, looking backwards with our traditional businesses, as well as when we engage with SIs. For large deals, big deals, $1 million plus deals, chances are we're engaged side-by-side with the systems integrator or a major partner in those.","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Bhavan, the things that maybe point out is there are like 3 pieces to these services that customers need and get. The professional services, that are typically upfront around architecture, we're very involved there and very side-by-side with SI. Then, there's a sustaining kind of process, that's really about the rollout and implementation, that's where SIs and our Platinum and other types of partners really take over, where we'll take a backseat. We may have a technical relationship manager that's on-site with the customer. And then, there's this sort of a back end, which is tech support, which we take up -- discussing the larger deals and larger customers, we take up big responsibility there for post-sale technical support. So maybe that helps you understand it.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right. That's helpful, Mark. And then if I could squeeze one more in. When you look at the kind of service-provider sales you're doing, there is a SaaS component to your sales of XenDesktop. And as I look at that kind of sale, I wonder how is that growing, and sort of that provides a recurring revenue stream that we don't necessarily see broken out of the deferred. So how do you think about that and how fast is that growing?","Mark B. Templeton","Well, the concentration of -- I think you're talking about our Service Provider Network. It's getting to be about almost 2,000 strong, and where we provide Service Provider Licensing Agreements where they rank [ph], sort of buy the -- buy the drink, buy the customer. That's primarily focused around XenApp, okay? And our networking products that work in conjunction with XenApp. That business has actually been really growing off along a very, very nice track. And one of the reasons that we invested in an acquisition like EMS-cortex, as well as some of the things we've done with the Cloud.com acquisition, because we've seen this FP channel to markets, it's an SMB-type customer or a more forward-thinking enterprise, this is how they want to buy product in the future. So we're early invested there and really like the performance. But in the overall numbers it's still going to be, let's say, 1% of our kind of quarterly business.","David James Henshall","Yes. And I'll just add on that specifically, Bhavan, it's running somewhere in that $5 million plus per quarter, and you're right, it's great. It's recurring highly visible revenue.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wondering if you could just talk a bit about the high touch model that you're starting to move to on the sales and marketing side and whether or not you're seeing any -- what impact do you expect to see from a revenue perspective and what impact do you expect to see from a cost side? I know you're talking about spending more money.","David James Henshall","Yes, I think you're seeing the impact right now. It's not that much more high touch, but it's really about working with customers that are making a big strategic commitment. And that's everything, as Mark said, from early assessment through migrations through post-sales support. And the impact is showing up in the large deals. I mean that's really the place where you would see it. And if you just look at the metrics that we talked about over the course of the last several quarters, Q3 was a huge record in terms of large deals where you -- I think we booked 40 deals over $1 million.  We had 48 in Q4. And if I look into the pipeline, we've got a huge amount of opportunity out there. That's the kind of business we want to be driving with customers because we're moving from a transactional sale to one that is more -- looks and feels more like infrastructure. It's stickier, it's larger, it's a long-term relationship, and it's not on a case-by-case basis. So we're going to keep moving in that direction over time.","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Walter, I'd just add that this is something that we've been investing in for quite a while. And I think we, in the last year, have seen this huge tick up in these -- in the number of seven-figure deals per quarter, and the year-on-year growth in the transaction count is amazing. And that's a result of the investments we have made. So we'll just continue to do that, which means specializing the sales force more with enterprise relationship managers that specialize in the customer relationship, and understanding where they want to go from a business perspective and how our technology can support that. And then, acting as a quarterback, if you will, to bring in the right product specialist, including FEs and specialists in networking, collaboration, data sharing, et cetera. So that's how we see that playing out going forward, and it's really it's much -- it's evolution is the way we think of it.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, David, just a question around deferred revenue, I think it was alluded to that there's more of these ELA-style transactions, anyway you could help us understand how much more license revenue is going into deferred that maybe 1 year ago, you wouldn't have seen going into deferred that would have taken up front?","David James Henshall","No, I don't know a year-over-year comp and we've really never broken it out that way, but the long-term deferred growth, which was just under $20 million, is the way to think about those multiyear deals. That's usually where it shows up, and it moves around quarter-to-quarter. So I mean, there is not a straight-line trend here. There will be one of those dynamics that you'll certainly see more in the second half of the year because that's when the big deals tend to be concentrated.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had a question on the cash flow side. David, it looks like you have fantastic deferred revenue quarter. You've talked about the special improvement. On a year-over-year basis, it nonetheless look like cash flows were down, and it looks like -- it comes to, well, DSOs edged up a little bit. Curious if you can give us a little color, even if just for the deferred revenue increase. It does look like DSOs went up in Q4. Maybe you can just help us understand how to model the cash flows going forward, because you seem to have been a little off in our estimates at least for Q4. And second and final, just to -- not get too focused on the XenDesktop licensing, but we are all using different assumptions to get to what that growth rate was, I know you are trying to steer us away from the granularity there, but if I look at the number of new customers, it looks like Q3 had about 3,000 customers and Q4 about 2,700 customers. At least, based on my, maybe, incorrect assumptions, XenDesktop license growth looks to be about 29%, 30%. Just trying to understand, how you get that confidence, is there something in the pipeline that you're seeing that gives you the confidence that this product family can continue to be a good grower, and not withstanding the fact that you've got some tough comps in 2012. That's it.","David James Henshall","Kash. Yes, you got a few questions in there. So I tell you what, let me just kind of walk through those. As far as the cash flow, DSO or in account -- in AR, you're right, it's absolutely a function of deferred revenue growth. If you look at the nearly $130 million growth in deferred revenue, that's what's attributable to the bump in DSOs. You normalize that, I mean, that's close to 20 days right there, just from growth in deferred revenue. So I guess the real question is the underlying quality of receivables, those are unchanged over the course of last year or so. So as far as XenDesktop and individual products, like I've been saying all year, that it really isn't the right way to be looking at the business to be breaking these things out between individual products because that's not the way we run the business. That's not the way customers think about it. That's not the way we're going to market. We're really focused on selling the right solution or whatever the customer requirement is. And in that case, both XenApp and XenDesktop have a role to play. And so, I've been trying to break away from giving individual product granularity for some quarters now, and in this quarter, I think now that we're more -- significantly more than 50-50 XenDesktop, it's the appropriate time to just start talking more qualitatively and less quantitatively. I will say that a couple of metrics though that I will point out, I think, that will continue to give you some, say, more information on the business.","In terms of new customers, you're right, in Q4, there was about 2,700 net new customers that bought XenDesktop, which brings nearly 9,000 for the full year, it's a huge step up from where we were in prior period. You've got, in total, well over 12,000 customers that purchased XenDesktop. And the growth rate for the full year of the standalone business, it'll be north of 50%. So when we think about the forward-looking guidance, or commentary on confidence, it's based on a number of factors, including record pipeline for desktop solutions business, record number of large deals, solid coverage, ratios, competitive position, et cetera, et cetera, so it's all analytically based. And we think that's the right place to be.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, 2 questions. First of all, license update, which had decelerated from double-digit growth and in the high single-digit growth this year. And now I think it was a function kind of the trailing impact of weaker bookings coming off recession. It's -- I think we have reason to expect that, that would start to reaccelerate at this point now that you're getting better bookings. And should we think of that as possibly now reaccelerating into the double digits in the next year?","David James Henshall","Michael, I think you're starting to see that in Q4. The commentary about why it has been declining is exactly right, and it bumped up from about 7% year-on-year growth in Q3 to 9% in Q4. I think it's going to be a gradual increase because we've also got the Trade-up Program that's driving some impact to that aggregate number. But as far as directions, the trend is up from a growth rate perspective. Renewal rates are strong in that program. And the more customers we bring in on the top line from new license sales, the more it just feeds the pool. So, yes.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Good. So you're up into the right, good. Second question, just can you give us a sense of how much inorganic growth you might add in 2011 in revenue?","David James Henshall","Yes, not a lot, actually. Most of the transactions that we closed, we did in the back end of the year. And so, you just look at the accounting and the ramp rate. And so it's less than -- well less than 1% of our overall business.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I haven't completely thought it through, but any any reason to think of any inorganic in the next year, except from some stuff that might have been done at the end of this year?","David James Henshall","Yes, I think that's really a large part of the business story, as we think about 2012 and a lot of the investments that I talked about, building out these new businesses, including businesses like Cloud.com, like ShareFile, like FTA, that -- while dilutive in the early part of the year, I think we're going to exit 2012 on a revenue run rate that is north of $50 million for those businesses.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ray Melencio [ph] from Barclays.","Unknown Analyst","Can you talk a little bit on the online division on -- you mentioned ShareFile and things like that, the initiatives, what do you see in terms of competitive dynamic because some of the lower end competitors like -- working and seems to be more aggressive on pricing and pushing the solutions there as well? Does that mean there's going to be some change in the competitive dynamic and then as a result, growth rate?","David James Henshall","Yes, Raymond, I think this is -- that's one of the businesses that has always been extremely competitive. There are a lot of different solutions in the market, and including many free solutions. And so price competition has been, always been tough. Our strategy is really about product differentiation. And if you look back over the last couple of years, we've moved from sharing screens as collaboration to including audio and now, high-definition video. And as we go forward, we start to demonstrate how we're using our data-sharing technology really as a platform for new initiatives around Workspaces, which allowed teams to collaborate and create more stickiness, as well as just increase differentiation in the market. And so that's been our strategy there. And ever competing on prices, never a long-term winning strategy, so we've taken the product differentiation, and kind of the customer success and simplicity path. And we think that's the right way to be on.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be Bob Calderoni, Executive Chairman, Kirill Tatarinov, President and Chief Executive Officer, and David Henshall, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.","This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems' Investor Relations website. The webcast will be posted immediately following the call. Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website.","I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the US securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.

David?","David Henshall","Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We're making great progress on the operational initiatives that we launched last year. At a high level, the most important activity has really been simplifying our strategic focus, driving both portfolio optimization and clarity in terms of what's most important to the company, our partners and our customers.","Our results for Q4 reflect the progress the team has made in absorbing and adjusting to these initiatives, cost structure work, org and leadership evolution and changes to our field and channel strategy.","We continue to focus our energy towards our core strategy, the secure delivery of absent data, really setting the company up for even better results, efficiency and growth as we look forward.","As you saw from the release today, total revenue was up 6% year-on-year in Q4, with product license up 5%. Adjusted operating margins jumped to 32%. Adjusted EPS was $1.66 per share, up 50%, and we generated $282 million in cash flow from ops.","In total, we closed 86 $1 million-plus transactions across products and services. The Americas region booked the majority of these, with 60, and EMEA had 23.","Just a couple of points that are worth noting in that the average value of these large deals increased significantly year-on-year in both the US and EMEA. And at a product level, I think we saw really good balance across the portfolio.","Roughly 33% were made up of virtualization and mobile products, 33% from networking, 20% from the full workspace suite, and the remainder coming from subscription and services.","The combination of these large transactions, plus strong renewals in other businesses and the ongoing migration to higher value maintenance offerings, boosted total deferred revenue by $154 million sequentially. On an annual basis, short term deferred is up 4%, while multi-year is up 16%.","From a geo perspective, when you exclude the SaaS businesses, the Americas was really the big driver in the quarter, with revenue up 11%. EMEA was flat, but results in APAC declined by 13% year-on-year.","Since our restructuring last year occurred earlier in the US versus the other geos, the US teams have had much more time to stabilize and adapt to their structure, really a key contributor to this performance in Q4.","Next, let's take a look at the Q4 results within our three primary businesses. Our workspace services business grew 4% year-on-year, to $352 million, including license growth of 1%, continuing the steady improvement in results we've seen over the past five quarters.","Really more than any of our other businesses, workspace services should benefit the work we're doing to simplify focus and strategy. And as we've reviewed before, there's a number of very specific initiatives that we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through innovation, verticalization, and the aggregation of our unique assets.","We built the market leading products that allow secure delivery of the world's most important applications, including Windows, web, mobile and customer line of business apps. Plus, we've built the integrations into our enterprise file sharing and networking solutions that together create really a powerful mobility system for our customers, as well as market differentiation.","In the quarter, the Workspace Suite, which is our comprehensive solution for app and data delivery contributed nearly 20% of license revenue for this group, and this compares to just 9% a year ago.","Additionally, we continue to grow our CSP business, where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver subscription-based offerings to their customers. This quarter, CSP revenue grew over 30% year-on-year and closed the full year at just over $55 million in total recognized revenue.","So we're delivering a complete mobility solution, allowing customers of all sizes to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility, on-premise or service based, and we do it really all with a customer-centric experience that only Citrix can provide.","Next, looking at the delivery networking, total revenue increased 13% in the quarter, to $220 million, including license growth of 10%. The strength in this business was driven by NetScaler. Offsetting this was a significant decline in ByteMobile as we transition away from that product line.","But focusing on NetScaler, it's important to remind everybody that the business here is essentially made up of three segments, attach sales, enterprise ADC, and strategic service providers.","Attach sales, where customers are purchasing networking and workspace services together as part of a larger Citrix solution, represented about 20% of the NetScaler mix in Q4. There were over 800 of these transactions and this compares with just 700 a year ago.","Enterprise ADC was about 33% of the mix, growing modestly, and the service provider segment contributed more than 40% of license. And similar to what we discussed in Q3, we saw strong demand across the main major service cloud providers. All in, we sold to over 2,500 unique customers in the period with 36% being new customers","Finally, in our SaaS-based solutions, we delivered revenue of $194 million, up 15% in the quarter. The communications cloud remains the largest part of this business, contributing over 60% of the mix and growing about 19% year-on-year.","In the workflow area, our data platform, ShareFile, was up nearly 30% in subscription-based revenue with the majority of this growth coming across regulated verticals.","Our focus on improving retention rates of the active user base has really helped net new business increase significantly year-over-year. This has been driven by changes across product packaging, as well as customer care organization.","Back in November, we announced the intention to spin our GoTo family of products in the second half of this year. And I'd say that these plans remain well on track and in the coming quarters we'll provide much more visibility into this business, as well as into the ShareFile business that will remain part of Citrix going forward.","So turning to operations, we have delivered a rapid increase in margins over the past few quarters, really despite funding incremental investments in our higher growth businesses.","As we discussed last year, we built detailed restructuring plans across the company with the intent that these would generate permanent expense reductions, allow the company to execute more efficiently with fewer moving parts and prepare for greater scalability in the future.","In November, we announced headcount actions primarily targeting non-quota carrying areas in order to minimize the impact on our ability to service customers and drive revenue.","Generally speaking, I'd say we broke these notifications down into two events. The first one occurred in mid-November and the second one concluded in early January. I would point out that many of these roles have transition elements to them. So the expense realization will be phased in throughout the year.","In Q4, we posted 32% adjusted op margin. This is up nearly 600 basis points from last year and is actually the highest margin of any quarter over the last 10 years. For the full year, we delivered 26%, as compared to just 22% in 2014, well ahead of our original guidance at the beginning of the year. And currently, I'd say I think we're well on our way to achieving the 30% plus goal we laid out for fiscal '17.","This focus on leverage has also helped increase cash flow from operations, which was $282 million in Q4 and over $1 billion for the full year. This is clearly a record for the company. When you translate this, it's about $6.45 a share for all of 2015.","And finally, we remained active with our buyback program last quarter. We repurchased 4.3 million shares and this increases the total for the full year to over 11 million shares. We also announced today that the Board has authorized an additional $400 million to fund our ongoing program.","So before I wrap up, let me talk about our current outlook and expectations for Q1 '16 and for the full year. Our operational programs are clearly working. I'd say we're very happy with their results so far and we're confident in our plans for the balance of the year.","At the same time, we want to remain mindful of any potential disruptions that can occur, really with any restructuring. So with that, we intend to remain conservative across many of our assumptions, but we will be increasing our current expectations.","For Q1 '16, we expect revenue in a range of $785 million to $790 million and adjusted EPS between $0.91 and $0.93 a share. For fiscal '16, revenue between $3.31 billion and $3.32 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.65 to $4.75 per share. And as a reminder, this represents all businesses, including GoTo.","So now I'd like to turn it over to Bob to give further color on the quarter. Bob?","Bob Calderoni","Thank you, David. I am very excited to have the opportunity to speak with you today for a host of reasons. First, I want to provide more context around the solid results David just shared.","Next I want to give you an update on the progress we have been making to refocus our strategy and execute on the ongoing operating initiatives we outlined in November.","And last, but certainly not least, I want to share my excitement and introduce you to Citrix's new President and Chief Executive Officer. So let's get started.","First, needless to say, I am very pleased with the performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. On the top line, the performance was impressive in and of itself, and even more so when you consider that we were implementing a number of restructuring activities in the sales organization during the fourth quarter.","Carlos Sartorius and his team demonstrated that it's possible to restructure the organization and keep focus on execution, not only delivering on our expectations, but far exceeding with a beat of more than $25 million with most of that upside coming from product and license revenues.","After a few consecutive quarters of declining license revenues, we posted solid gains in both Q3 and Q4. As David pointed out, we had good performance once again in our NetScaler strategic service provider segment.","However, it's also important to point out that performance continues to improve in workspace services, as well where we saw positive license revenue growth for the first time in a while, which is even more encouraging when you consider the mix shift towards more subscription and term based licenses.","I believe this is a function of improving execution and also the early benefits of our renewed focus on secure apps and data delivery, which has received excellent feedback from our employees, partners and customers alike.","This focus allows us to put all of our energy and resources into what is most important to us and to our customers, which I believe is a key contributor to our top line performance this quarter.","A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to participate in Citrix Summit, which is our annual kickoff with our sales team and our partners. You could feel the energy in the room, as the collective team had just participated in an excellent end of the year.","Both our sales team and partners had very positive feedback about the event and they were particularly appreciative of the focus of the company, our simplified go-to-market strategy, and our reenergized partner program.","On the partner front, they were excited not only about the clarity we provided on the portfolio, but also about the innovation we are driving in our core products. At the event, we showcased new capabilities for Microsoft technologies, browser-based apps and software defined WAN. These innovations line up with some of the major buying cycles going on in the tech sector that play to Citrix strengths.","Citrix can significantly accelerate and simplify the migration to Windows 10. We'll be ready with similar capabilities for Server 2016 when it launches later this year and our new optimization pack delivers deep integration within the Skype architecture, allowing us to deliver virtualized Skype functionality to Windows, Mac and Linux desktops, making us a preferred partner for Skype for business and giving us the lead competitive position.","There are also a host of other IT buying trends that Citrix is in great position to capitalize on. For example, the massive adoption of Chromebooks and explosion in the use of browser-based apps is creating new opportunities for us to simplify and secure the delivery of apps for our customers.","At Summit, we announced our browser app service that eliminates the headaches of browser version compatibility and mitigates the security risks involved with browser-based apps.","In addition to these market trends, we're also benefiting from our focus on industry verticals, especially in financial services and healthcare. By focusing on these verticals, we add features to our core products that meet the needs of specific industry use cases, which gives us a significant competitive advantage.","Along with our focus and execution this has enabled us to beat the competition and in several cases, resulted in competitive takeouts versus VMware, which is reflected in our excellent results this quarter.","The competitive winds are definitely turning in our favor. That is true with customers, evidenced by a number of competitive takeouts. It's true in partners, as well as on the recruiting front.","I'm equally pleased with the progress on cost and margin improvement. When we last met, I shared how the recommendations from our strategic and operating reviews would not only focus the business on our core competencies and in segments where we have or can build a defensive leadership position, but also to streamline the organization to improve execution and reduce the ongoing cost structure of the business.","As you can see in the results this quarter, we're making great strides, with adjusted operating margins up nearly 600 basis points year-on-year. A number of our initiatives are already implemented and we are on track with more than 30 individual projects realizing faster savings, which is reflected in the quarter's results, as well as in the increased EPS guidance for 2016.","Back in November, we set goals for 2016, which I characterized as conservative. The team did an outstanding job this quarter of performing, while implementing the restructuring.","Yet I believe it's prudent to remain conservative and realize a few more quarters of consistent performance before we raise expectations further. Considering current performance and the recent trends in the business, I would say our 2016 guidance remains very conservative, if not more so today.","Before introducing Kirill, let me just say a few words of thanks to the team for the tremendous support they've given to me over the past six months, since I first joined as Exec Chair and more recently, as interim CEO.","We have a terrific team here at Citrix. It's a very smart team. They are dedicated and the culture is ingrained with a deep desire to win and a competitive spirit that I'm very accustomed to.","They have given me all the support I could ask for and they've shown what they can do when focused on a core mission and freed from distractions. They rapidly embrace the changes in the business and have shown that less can be more, not only more profit, but more revenue, as well. And they have shown that they can drive results in the business, while simultaneously implementing difficult restructuring actions.","The mission is not complete, far from it, but I'm encouraged by the progress to date. The winds are clearly shifting in our favor. The team is energized and confident. They are competing more aggressively and winning in the market.","They are building momentum in the business, as evidenced not just by my words, but by their performance. I'm very proud to have been part of this team and thankful for the support I received as interim CEO.","I look forward to continuing on as Exec Chair as we build upon our great start. Going forward, my focus first and foremost is on providing Kirill and the team any support they need.","And beyond that, I plan to continue to stay involved in the restructuring and operating actions we outlined in November, the spin out of our GoTo business and the capital structure items.","So finally, let me say how pleased I am to have Kirill join us as our new Chief Executive Officer. I and the rest of the search committee conducted a very thorough search. We considered a number of candidates, focused on those with a background that includes both leadership experience, as well as technology and product expertise. Most importantly, we looked for leaders who shared our company's core values and a relentless focus on customer and partner success.","Kirill has a proven track record of growing businesses and driving operational performance. When you couple that with his deep product background and the fact that he knows our space, our competitors and our biggest partners, there could not be a better fit between a candidate and an opportunity.","So I am really excited to have Kirill join and lead this company to our next phase of growth. So with that, let me officially welcome Kirill to Citrix and turn the call over to him so he can introduce himself and say hello. Kirill?","Kirill Tatarinov","Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. I'm extremely excited to be part of Citrix. I've obviously known Citrix over the years as a peer and a partner in the industry and I always viewed Citrix as a great company with highly respected brand, differentiated products, strong team, large and loyal partner channel and amazing customers around the world. In fact, many of whom I also served in my prior roles.","Today is only my third day with the company, so I wanted to share just a couple thoughts on why I am so excited about joining Citrix. From my discussions with many CIOs over the years, it is clear that secure delivery of apps and data is one of their most important priorities in driving digital transformations in their companies and helping people in their organizations work better, and this is precisely what Citrix does.","Personally, joining Citrix feels a bit like a home coming for me. Throughout my career, I have been passionate about helping people at work to be more productive. I've been fortunate to have an opportunity to build and lead innovative organizations with multi product portfolios. And I had an opportunity to grow businesses at scale through a partner-centric go-to-market model. So it seems like a perfect fit.","I am delighted Bob is staying on as our Executive Chairman, continuing with the projects initiated last fall and helping me onboard and immerse in the business. I look forward to working with Bob and the leadership team to execute on Citrix's operating plan and drive greater value for our customers, partners and shareholders. I want to thank you for joining us today and I look forward to engaging with many of you in the coming weeks and months.","And now, I would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a great quarter, and Kirill, welcome on board. And let me start with one quick question on workspace. You returned to license growth again.","Can you talk a little bit about the areas of strength there? And if I look especially about the geographic performance, there seems to be almost room for further upside? Thank you.","David Henshall","Sure, Raimo, it's David. Let me just repeat a few things that I said earlier. And really, what's going on in the workspace services is the culmination of a lot of these activities that we've talked about over the last several quarters, not only to reinstate the focus on XenApp, but all of the other technologies that are around that to create those types of solutions.","In terms of the actual drivers, two big things I'd call out. First is the holistic workspace suite. Everyone knows that's our solution for enterprise mobility, talking about apps, mobility and data in one broader, more strategic conversation with customers. That is up to about 20% of the mix right now. That was less than 10% a year ago, growing at close to 200% year-on-year.","The second piece is actually around our service provider business, the CSPs. That is all subscription-based, monthly ratable, approaching a $60 million business and growing north of 30%. That's really the big one.","We're also driving lots of innovation forward. So things that Bob called out, whether it's the focus on helping customers with Win 10 migrations, virtualizing Skype for business, browser servers, new management capabilities, lots of things in that area really just demonstrating and accelerating the market leadership we've had for all these years.","And that's the message we're carrying forth to partners. That's a message that our sales teams are driving, and it's allowing for the continuous improvement in overall execution.","I'd say back to the comment about the geos, yes, in Q4, the Americas was really the big driver. I made a comment in my prepared remarks about that's the place where we initiated the restructuring last year.","So they've had a lot more time to work through all the changes, gets settled into the new structure, engage with partners, et cetera. So we're certainly optimistic that as we roll into '16, you'll see a similar type of performance flow through in the other geos.","Raimo Lenschow","Perfect. That's very clear. Thank you. Well done.","David Henshall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi, thanks. David, I'm wondering if you could maybe outline for us some of the sort of quarter-by-quarter just trends on quarter-by-quarter headwinds from a revenue perspective that you expect through 2016.","You talked about that, I think, on the November call and gave an aggregate number from some of the changes you're making to the business model. And I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on that, now that we're into the end of the year for quarters here?","David Henshall","Yes, I would encourage everybody to go back and look at the detail from the November call, because we called out a number of those very specific headwinds. But just to net it out for you, I mean, there is three big pieces that were either deemphasized, shut down or sold. And the three that I would call out would be ByteMobile, Podio and Cloud.","So those three together represent about $85 million of revenue last year, and that is the bridge between what we had described as pro forma revenue growth in the November period and the guidance. Those are really the biggest headwinds there and the easiest way to normalize the '15 to '16 guide.","Walter Pritchard","And just on their - yes, seasonality, I guess, is what I'm trying to get at?","David Henshall","Yes, well, also I'd say that our approach right now has been to be just on a general basis really cautious across everything on a guidance front. We're working through several dozen individual projects across restructuring plan. I think we are incredibly happy with the progress we've made to date. We feel good about the outcome, but these things always have the potential for some level of volatility.","Q4, we clearly work through probably the most challenging, and end up with a good results, but we want to be mindful of that this early in the year. That's probably the biggest headwind that I would talk about. Was there a follow-up question, Walter?","Walter Pritchard","No, I'm good. Thank you. That's it. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Steve Ashley","Thanks very much. I would just like to ask about the changes that have taken place in the channel. Maybe you can talk about some of the things that have changed relative to your channel program and maybe more specifically what and how incentives might have been - might be changing?","David Henshall","Steve, I'd say at a high level, the way to think about it is we've just simplify the approach for how we're engaging with partners. We've some provide everything from the types of accounts, where they are eligible to participate. There had been some segmentation in the past, we've removed that.","The idea is just how do we engage with the channel instead of driving us versus yours. I think those are the - that's probably the easiest way to describe the changes between '15 and '16.","The others around the signification and focus message that we've talked about over the past couple quarters. Certainly, our partners want to hear that as well. Here is what we're focused on, here is what's important to them, here is how they make money for their businesses and then just driving a relentless focus against that. And so that's why we are seeing better and better results.","Once that I would call out is, it's fairly early on, but in Q4 we had about a 15% increase in actual CSA partners that were selling products. So that's our ability to reengage with partners and show the vibrancy in our channel, very important going forward.","Steve Ashley","Terrific. And then, you talked about in the past about may be building out a channel or that would address the mid-market by the lower end of the market that you haven't in the past. Is that something that\u2019s underway or how might we think about that?","David Henshall","Sure. There's a big focus that we placed on broader mid-market when we are with partners just a couple weeks ago. And it's not necessarily just a channel conversation, but it's much more holistic than that. And it needs to start with understanding the needs of the customers, making sure we've got the right products and services to address that and then the GoTo market motion that makes it.","And so we're kind of attacking that top to bottom. Some of the products that we have talked about today, whether they are browser servers and things that are just easier to adopt and manage and scale, more targeted towards the mid-market.","So internally, we talk a lot about land and expand and you'll hear more about that certainly is we get into the second quarter and synergy, our event with partners and customers in the May timeframe.","Steve Ashley","Great. My congrats as well. Thanks.","David Henshall","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phillip Winslow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Barris","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Michael Barris on for Phil. Delivery networking obviously had a pretty good quarter. Could you give us some more color on how you're thinking about the segment going into 2016? Thanks.","David Henshall","Sure. Delivery networking is the overall business is doing well. I talked about the three main pieces in my prepared remarks and I think that's the way you should expect us to discuss networking going forward.","The attached motion is the first piece. And that is where customers are purchasing really a workspace services solution and a networking product in conjunction to create more of a system. Not only does it provide more value for Citrix on a bookings level, but it creates a lot of differentiation and added value for customers. That's one.","The staff that I called out is that we had 800 of those types of those transactions in a quarter versus 700 a year ago. If you invert the metric, that's about a 12% attach rate to virtualization orders and that's up from 9% a year ago. So that's one of the key focus areas.","The second is around what we would describe as core ADC, and this is enterprise ADC and that's largely a focus area for coverage. And so one of the investments that we're making right now is to increase coverage in multiple geos that should allow us to be able to service many more of those engagements.","And then the third is around strategic service providers, which as everyone knows, we have tremendous engagement with a handful of large customers, but their purchasing patterns tend to be a bit volatile.","So overall, we expect to be able to grow in line or faster than the market in '16, but be a little bit cautious about the timing of the SSP's and where those hit.","Michael Barris","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho. Your line is open.","Abhey Lamba","Yes, thank you. Congrats on a great quarter. Kirill, welcome to Citrix. And if we could just hear from you in terms of your commitment to the plan laid out by the previous management team and what's your vision for the company? How do you think it will look in two to three years from now?","Kirill Tatarinov","Well, I will answer it in one word. The commitment is unwavering. I've obviously had an opportunity to study the plan in depth. I think it's an amazing plan and I think the team has done amazing job last quarter executing on this plan. And my job one is to stay the course, continue to plan, continue executing with the plan and drive it forward.","Abhey Lamba","What's your vision for the company? How do you think it would look in two to three years from now? And David, if you would comment on any disruption at VMware kind of helping in the mobility space for you guys? That's it from me.","David Henshall","Well, as I mentioned tonight in my remarks earlier, secure delivery of apps and data is a very high on the priority list CIOs around the world. Mobility plays an important part of that and I am really encouraged with the solutions that we have in the future that it would bring to those customers.","Taking beyond that, I probably take couple more days before I start talking to about the future vision two years out I hope you would give me those couple days.","Bob Calderoni","Yes. On the second part of the question, this is Bob, on VMware. I'd say the company had a very good quarter relative to the competition this quarter. Looking at a long list of competitive wins, some of those were head-to0head wins for new business and frankly there are number of pretty significant competitive take outs this quarter versus VMware.","So I'd say that as I mentioned in my comments, the competitive wins are definitely moving in our favor. That was building as a quarter went on. I would say that\u2019s true from a customer point of view, given the wins.","I would say that\u2019s true from a partner point of view. I think the partners have definitely noticed some very good changes in the relationship with Citrix here from just the way we're partnering better in the field.","They like the focus and the renewed energy around the core of our business and I would say on the recruiting front as well. So even with employees, I think we've definitely seen a shift in activity there as well. So we're feeling rather - I would say we're feeling rather bullish right now and very optimistic going into 2016.","Abhey Lamba","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen. Your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz","Congratulations as well on a very good quarter. Bob, as you noted earlier, Workspace Services showed positive license growth for the first time in a while. Clearly this was not something that was expected by the street. I realize it's early in the game with respect to the refine strategy to focus on secure apps and data delivery. But do you think that positive license growth in this segment is sustainable?","Bob Calderoni","Well, look when we adjusted the plan here, it was all about focus. And we said we're going to focus on secure apps and data delivery and that was going to allow us to streamline the organization and reduce costs.","And I think there was probably too much emphasis or maybe too many people attached that to a cost reduction focus. Yes, we are reducing costs and we are improving margins. But I fundamentally believe that a more focused organization is a better executing organization.","We have all the wood behind fewer arrows in this organization. So every single person, whether you are in sales, whether you are in services, whether you are in engineering, whether you are in customer support, every single person in this organization is going to execute better with that focus.","And I believe its early still, but I believe the results and the improved results and the growth that we saw this quarter is the early signs of the benefits we're going to see from that focus. And I expect as we rollout 2016 we'll continue to see the benefits of that focus.","We're not going to forecast revenue with that discrete of a line item, but I do expect continued improvement and continued execution as we benefit from that renewed focus.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just a follow up for David. So your R&D expense I believe went down in Q4 by about $6 million and is now below 14% of revenues. How are you thinking about R&D this year versus 2015? Thanks.","David Henshall","Yes, I would say, overall, just you take a step back and look at OpEx as a percent of revenue. I mean, in 2014, we were running right around 63%, '15 we were running 60%, and this year our guidance would put you probably at 56%, 57% of revenue.","And that's good from a non-margin point of view that\u2019s driving in the direction that we're trying to get to. But when you take a step back and if you recall what we talked about in November, a lot of our focused efforts were around actually increasing investments on our core solutions. We're doing that by trimming away things. We're contributing to revenue. We're redundant, et cetera, et cetera.","And so if I look at very specific to core products, like XenApp for example, I mean, there's not a single engineer has been removed from that organization. In fact, we'll be increasing investments there, and networking, and data, et cetera.","And so, don't focus too much on the absolute. I think it would be more important to focus on the individual initiatives that we're driving. Long-term, 14%, 15%, 16% of revenue is relatively typical for large software companies, some economies of scale, but I feel pretty confident about the capacity we have overall in the system.","Gregg Moskowitz","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you. Just two quick questions. One, David, I was wondering, I know it's early, but in November you gave us some early color on calendar '17. I am just wondering if you could give us a sense of given Q4 results, if you can update that - update us on whether or not that still stands.","And then I guess just another question and I apologize if this was asked. I was on another call. You had a competitor last night talking about market share gains. I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of color on kind of what you are seeing and the end user computer market and how you see the competitive environment evolving? Thank you.","David Henshall","Yes. Let me take the first part of that question and then have Bob address the second part. 2017, yes, unchanged in terms of the way we're thinking about it. Honestly we had our - just getting into '16 right now, so that's the primary focus.","But when we were in November, we laid out a growth rate of 4%, 5% on the top line for '17 and north of 30% operating margin for the full year. And I feel very good about those at this point in time.","I mean, one of the things that we had covered was just the impact of some of these discontinued businesses is the primary reason revenue is dipping into '16 and once we normalize that, we'll have a much better, much clearer picture of the go forward business.","Once that normalizes, year-over-year comps look good, the accelerated investments that we're making into things that will facilitate and drive long-term growth, I think are still in place, as we layer in increased capacity in areas, go-to-market areas like networking et cetera, I think that all portends good things for '17.","So no change, feel good about the progress so far and clearly we're executing well, it shows up in Q4. Bob, do you want to talk about the competitive environment?","Bob Calderoni","Yes. Thanks, David. Heather, I think earlier where I'd made some comments about the competitive wins turning in our favor. We certainly see that on the win loss state, that we see that competitive take outs. I think we see it now in our results where our Workspace Service business continues to improve.","So what I see our competitive wins. I see our results improving. I see our backlog increasing. That's what I see. It's a little bit different than what I hear. I know you refer to that in your question on some comments made yesterday what I hear is a little bit different than what I see.","What I hear is a $1 billion business growing at 30%. I hear a collection of $1 billion businesses growing at 20% or 30%. But when you look at the total results, you see 1% decline in license revenue that quarter.","So I guess I need somebody a little better than I was with numbers to explain how that works. But the things I see looked really good and the things I hear, I frankly don't believe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sanjit Singh","Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to see if you could give us some insight into the product roadmap over 2016 and 2017 with a renewed focus on the core data delivery side of - the app delivery side of the product portfolio. What can your challenge partners and your customers expect from a product roadmap standpoint?","And then as a quick follow-up, in terms of the geographic commentary, you didn\u2019t call any sort of macro weakness or any spending environment weaknesses and we've heard some commentary to that end from a couple software companies.","So I wanted to see if you were to - your take on the spending environment, particularly in APAC, it sounds like you're talking about more restructuring going on there than anything related to spending environment in APAC? Just wanted to get your thoughts on that point as well?","David Henshall","Sure. Let me touch on those two separately. In terms of long-term product roadmaps, I mean, it's probably not an appropriate time to do that on the call like this. Shorter-term, we've talked to partners about just pretty rapid ramp and innovation across late 2015, 2016 in the workspace areas.","For those of you that have followed the company for a while, remember that we went through a major platform transition for a couple years around XenApp and desktop, et cetera. With that behind us, we've been able to really ramp the new innovation, new features, things like that just focusing on what customers need, how to be more successful, how to bridge between on-prem, hybrid and full cloud deployments, et cetera. So that's thematically is what we're doing in that area.","You see a lot of new improvements coming out in terms of just ways we integrate from a management layer, from end user experience, performance across lousy networks. The types of things that really matter to customers. We've laid all that out and we'll be talking a lot more about that at Synergy in the May timeframe.","Networking, very similar. We've taken our software-based strategy and really extended that across the platforms over the last couple years. For example, I didn't talk about this in the prepared remarks, but our Virtual Appliances, the VPX family is actually the fastest growing element of all of - of networking.","That grew well over 20% for the full year and in the quarter, as customers are utilizing a Virtual Appliance more in a - think about it in the context of a data fabric versus a physical box in the data center.","And so lots of things like that. We're going to continue to drive for very aggressively. And then of cloud solutions, which are a little bit further out in the future. So core message is, you know, come to Synergy, love to have everybody see the latest and Grace [ph] will talk much more about future roadmaps there.","In terms of the market, I think a number of companies have talked about macro and currency and that's all true. Its outside of the US, markets are little bit more volatile than they are domestically. I think everybody is just operating under the same basic assumptions and we saw some of that as well.","We really didn't feel worth calling about because frankly that's the way it\u2019s been over the past, two, three quarters anyway, fairly challenging in parts of APAC, certainly challenging in places in South America and others where you\u2019ve just had lots of currency volatility. And frankly the same holds true for EMEA, especially those markets that are more focused on energy.","So we're executing through that. We're really focused on the things we can control and that's what we're talking about now. Happy with what's going on in the Americas. We've got great new leadership in the EMEA space and we're excited about the things that we can accomplish in '16. So stay with us, we'll give you an update each and every quarter.","Sanjit Singh","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Zeller from Citrix. Your line is open.","Scott Zeller","Scott Zeller from Needham & Company. Question on XenApp, you mentioned earlier in your comments that there were no engineering cuts to XenApp and we've heard about this product being a focus for management over several quarters.","But can you offer some color around how the performance has been? Do you see at stabilizing? Anything would be helpful on that front?","David Henshall","Scott, I mean, if the question is like XenApp versus XenDesktop, versus Suite, versus others, those are packaging discussions more than anything else. The way to think about the business is in the aggregate. We have certainly seen more individual transactions move from point products like XenApp or XenDesktop, Workspace Suite and that's a good thing.","That\u2019s a focus of our message right now as we're talking to customers of that level, that encompasses all types of apps, all types of data, et cetera. That\u2019s why the suite is growing as fast as it is. The individual products move up and down depending on customer requirements for each individual transaction.","Scott Zeller","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Katherine Egbert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Katherine Egbert","Hi, good afternoon. A couple questions. First on the operating margins, you mentioned, Dave, this is the best margin and I think you said 10 years. For the year, you are up 400 basis points.","But yet it seems that the full sort of - I think you said some of the restructuring was still taking effect in January. It seems like maybe - can you just tell us about your margin guidance and how conservative it is and then of course the impact of GoTo, I think you said is in there as well?","David Henshall","Sure, Katherine. Let me set the stage a little bit. When you look at the two big businesses, GoTo and the Enterprise business. The Enterprise business is currently operating at a bit of higher margin than the GoTo. Just it\u2019s fairly common for SaaS base businesses. So when I talked about margin guidance, however, that is the hold-co [ph] forever side.","I mean, we'll go back and update guidance as appropriate once the spin is complete sometime in the second half of the year. So from a hold-co point of view, we went from 22.5% in '14 to a little over 25.5% in '15 and our guidance for '16 is north of 28%.","I think when you run the numbers for our current financial guidance, you'll land somewhere around 28.5%. And so we are quite comfortable with that. In terms of whether it's conservative or not, hopefully with hindsight everything is conservative, but that's our guidance as it stands today.","Katherine Egbert","All right. Thanks, David. And a quick question for you Kirill. Traditionally, Microsoft and Citrix have had a historically tight relationship and you are coming from Microsoft now.","Can you talk about maybe some areas that you see a high level where the companies can continue to work together particularly as with respect to cloud?","Kirill Tatarinov","I think it would be fair to say that the companies have worked together over the years very well and just studying what's transpired earlier this month at the summit, Microsoft participated at the summit and was very excited about innovation that it brings to market in particular supporting Skype business, Azure and other initiatives. And I can only expect this will continue and accelerate going forward. I look forward to being a part of this.","Katherine Egbert","All right, thank you very much. Congratulations.","Kirill Tatarinov","Thank you.","David Henshall","Thanks, Katherine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is open.","John DiFucci","Thank you. David, I first had a question and then a question for Kirill. This is I think the second quarter in a row, maybe even more than that of really strong service provider contribution to NetScaler and this is historically sort of been a periodic or cyclical sort of cadence with the major service providers.","But has it turned into more than that? Is this more - could this be the start of a more secular trend, as service providers were to accommodate sort of cloud build outs? And I guess, I know it's hard to tell but you have a pipeline you can see too and I'm just wondering when you look at the last couple quarters anyway, and then you look out into the future, what does that look like?","David Henshall","Sure, John. Yes, service providers are really important segment of the business. For those of you who have followed NetScaler for a long time, a number of that - it was nearly 100% of total revenue. If you roll a clock back, seven, eight years, we've diversified broadly across the idea of where I describe as attached, selling solutions and then core enterprise ADC.","It remains one of our most important, but like you said, it's a little volatile. I mean' what happened over the years is that its morphed from being a big spike in Q3 as dotcom's were focused on what was frankly the holiday shopping season, building out capacity for that too much more distributed now where people are delivering services to mobile devices, services to just SaaS and those types of things. So the business is much more broad than it used to be.","I'd say we have pretty good visibility into the full year. It's just that the timing of purchases tend to be concentrated based on when the customers need it. And so one of the hesitations we have about giving quarter-to-quarter guidance in that level is that it does move around.","If you remember back in 2014, we had a tremendous first-half of the year with the SMP segment and then a little weaker in the back half of the year, going into 2015, we said it was going to be the opposite.","So that came true and the first half was lighter with the SSP's and then the second half was very strong. When we look at it in hindsight, the full year was pretty much as expected. And so that is the only pause that I have when talking about guidance for that segment. It's predicated on their bills cycles.","John DiFucci","Okay.","David Henshall","For the year, I think we've got great relationships. I am really happy with our share and we're going to work very closely with them on all of their needs.","John DiFucci","Okay. Great. So, we're not quite sure but this might continue to be somewhat volatile. And I guess I have a follow-up. First of all, congratulations Kirill. That's great.","Kirill Tatarinov","Hi, John.","John DiFucci","It's great to hear your voice too. I realize you have operational experience with Microsoft and DMC, but I also know your roots are truly is a technologist. Listen, I know you had a couple questions around this. But - and we want to give you a chance to sort of assess what Citrix has.","But from what I know of you, I'm sure you did your due diligence and at least initially, I think you said listen, we have a plan and I am going to execute on the plan and that's great.","But as far as the context of a plan, Citrix is a technology company and I'm sure you have taken a look. Just curious even from a high level, from your perspective, what areas do you think there are opportunities to further advance Citrix is positioned in technology in a more meaningful way? I mean, even from a high level if you just give us your thoughts, I'm sure you have some?","Kirill Tatarinov","I mean, look, if you step back and look at the sort of major drivers of the industry today and major drivers of digital transformation, you clearly see mobility and you clearly see related to mobility, secure delivery of apps and data. That\u2019s what every CIO wants to see in their organization and that's what Citrix drive and I think the product portfolio supports it in a very significant way.","And I am really excited about that particular part of business workspace services and how it can continue to play that role. Obviously cloud is another hugely significant trend then NetScaler business it have - how NetScaler essentially becoming such a huge enabler of the cloud worldwide, essentially serving such a huge portion of cloud transactions for the major service providers, it\u2019s just astounding and I fully expect this to continue and accelerate as the world continues to shift to the cloud, which is now unstoppable, as people build out more data centers serving several [ph] clouds and more clouds around the world.","And then of course data and sharing data and enabling sort of analytics empowered by big data and the role that ShareFile technology plays in that particular trend as it relates to highly regulated industries.","That's another very important powerful trend that I see only accelerating in the future. And so those three things combined from the technology point of views, I went from my due diligence on the Citrix technical portfolio. That gets me really excited about the opportunity and I think that's what propels company into the future to the next phase of greatness.","John DiFucci","That's great. Listen, thank you for that perspective, Kirill and we look forward to hearing more from you as we forward.","Kirill Tatarinov","Absolutely, thank you, John. Good to hear your voice as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open.","James Wesman","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. It\u2019s James Wesman sitting in for Michael. David, can you talk a little bit - I know you guys have spoken a lot about workspace services. But can you guys talked about XenMobile and just how did this quarter, any color around the business would be helpful?","David Henshall","Yes, I mean we haven't broken out individual products for a while. But I'd say when I look at mobile as a stand-alone, I mean, more and more of the individual opportunities are morphing toward Suite. It's one of big, big driver for why customers would move from let say, XenApp to the full suite. And so that's where the conversation will start and that\u2019s the primary driver for why it's up in terms of overall mix.","From a market point of view, I mean, similar trends what we seen in the past. I mean, people are more concerned higher up the stack talking about EMM and anything at the device level. So no change on that front.","I don't think we'll plan on breaking it out with a lot of granularity going forward because there is just you know, there is packaging options that I think will skew the numbers a bit. But we'll provide more directional guidance as we get into 2016.","James Wesman","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Burke","Hi. It\u2019s Dan Burke for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about the changes made in the US being done before the rest of the world. A couple times on the call now. Just curious - is that one quarter, four quarters and then are you using essentially the same play book overseas? Thanks.","David Henshall","Yes, I'd say the US initiated a lot of restructuring earlier in '15 and whether that was just moving from a more distributed model to one that focuses on the product segments, some changes in the channel engagement models, it started in the first half of last year.","I don't want to imply that the other geos haven't been going through restructuring because they have but they are a couple, three quarters behind just in terms of maturity of the model. We've also gone through leadership evolution in EMEA and so that is all completed in the Q4 timeframe. So we're expecting good, solid, constant performance at of that geo in 2016.","Dan Burke","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire from CLSA. Your line is open.","Ed Maguire","Hi, good afternoon and welcomed to team Kirill. It's great to have you join Citrix. Had a question about the restructuring and some of the divestitures. I know there were several products that you divested over the last couple of months but I just wanted to get a pulse check on how far along you are.","How much is left to do with some of the resources that are being either rationalized or repurposed. How much work to you guys have ahead of you on the operational side?","Kirill Tatarinov","Sure. Ed, I'd say on the product front we are largely through it at least at an initiation level, everything's got execution that trails a few quarters in. I made a high level comment about some of the people related actions that we've got all behind us right now.","But if you recall the approach we took was not a top-down cost-cutting approach but really a bottoms up, focus on the business, focus on long-term, focus on the things that matter and so because of that there's a number of transitions in place right now and many of those frankly are in the product area. Hard decisions have been made that\u2019s behind us and now it's just about execution. So I'd say we are well on our way.","Ed Maguire","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open.","Brad Reback","Great, thanks very much. David, can you remind us about how much of your free cash flows generated in the US versus outside?","David Henshall","About half.","Brad Reback","And just a follow-up on that, given some of the gyrations in the debt markets right now, are you at all concerned about your ability to potentially raise debt in order to fund future buybacks at an acceptable cost?","David Henshall","No, Brad. It's actually not a concern of mine. We're not looking to raise staff at this moment in time. We've got $2 billion in cash and liquidity in other ways and we have been repurchasing a lot of stock at the same time.","So if we need to go approach the capital markets in the future, we will address that based on the facts and circumstances that are present then.","Brad Reback","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open.","Rakesh Kumar","Hi. This is Rakesh Kumar sitting in for Derrick Wood. Thanks for taking our question. I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on opportunities around Windows 10 migration and Windows Server 2016 and also are you doing anything to build services on Azure?","David Henshall","Let me take that at the high level. Yes, we're doing a lot of things with Microsoft. I'm sure if you go back and look at some of the materials and announcements we have made, whether it's at summit or synergy a year ago, you will see that everything from Windows server updates to Windows endpoint migrations, always an important part of our strategy around workspace services.","We had Brad Anderson on stage with us at summit just a couple of weeks ago talking about all the great things we're doing together, so yes, a lot of opportunity, definitely a driver in the business. Just allows us to collaborate that much tighter. In terms of Azure as a stand-alone, lots of things we're doing both with Azure, AWS and other major cloud providers, whether that's migrating workloads to the infrastructure, whether that's running control planes in the infrastructure, whether that's providing frankly infrastructure to the data centers and we've got a multifaceted relationship there.","Rakesh Kumar","Thank you.","David Henshall","Kyle, are there any more questions?","Operator","We have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. And I'll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","David Henshall","Okay. I just want to thank everyone again for joining us today. Really excited to have Kirill on board part of the team. Looking forward to 2016 and we'll talk to everyone again at the middle of April.

My name is Doris and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Citrix Systems Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] ","Thank you. I would now like to introduce Eduardo Fleites, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Fleites, you may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites","Thank you, Heidi. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be Kirill Tatarinov, President and Chief Executive Officer and David Henschel, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems Investor Relations website. The webcast will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the US Securities Law.","These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on the Company's Investor Relations website.","Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I'd like to turn it over to David Henschel, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO. David?","David Henschel","Thanks Eduardo and welcome to everyone joining us today. We continue to show good results and execution from the operational initiatives driving record profitability to the strength in product portfolio driving growth and increased win rates. We're focusing all of our energy on our core strategy of securely delivering apps and data, setting the company up for sustainable profitable growth throughout 2017. As you can see from the release, total revenue was flat in the quarter and up 4% for the year. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 35% in Q4 and 31% for fiscal \u201916. Adjusted EPS was $1.61 per share bringing the year to $5.32, up 23%. And we generated record deferred revenue up more than $190 million sequentially and 8% year-on-year due to strength in cloud and multi-year customer commitments. In Q4, we closed 96 $1 million plus transactions with strength in cloud, financial services, health care and government verticals. There is good balance across the portfolio, with more than half of these deals coming from the workspace services and the balance coming from networking and SaaS.","Next, looking at the Q4 results within our four primary businesses. Our workspace service business which includes virtualization of mobility grew 3% year-on-year to $464 million with product license also growing 3%. Momentum here continued for the fifth quarter in a row as our strategy and focus is showing results often in accounts where security and compliance are major concerns. As we've discussed, there are several specific initiatives we're driving to accelerate growth in this area including much faster innovation, integration of our unique assets, stepped up competitive positioning and reinvigoration of our channel partnerships especially Microsoft. All of these efforts have resulted in an increase in win rates and competitive opportunities. A few other dynamics that are worth noting include the continued license revenue growth in the Americas, up 10% in the quarter and 15% for the year. We're also beginning to see traction of our APJ restructuring with workspace license revenue of 9% in Q4. We had stable growth in our CSP subscription where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud-based offerings to their customers. Overall revenue in this area was up 30% within an ARR now over $80 million. ","Next, we're seeing great early traction from our new Citrix Cloud offerings including three seven figure transactions. And finally a really good response to Citrix Customer Success Services, the redefined software maintenance programs we announced at the beginning of the quarter helping to add to the strong increase in deferred revenue. In the delivery networking business, total revenue decreased 9% in the quarter to 201 million with license revenue down 20%. This result is line with our guidance for Q4 as we forecasted the sequential decline in cloud infrastructure and e-commerce bookings which were really strong over the first three quarters of the year. I remind everyone that the NetScaler business is essentially made up of three groups, cloud infrastructure and ecom, solution attached sales and enterprise ADC. In the quarter, solution attached represented over half the mix with a number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of the overall Citrix solution, up about 20% year-on-year. Cloud and ecom and the enterprise ADC segment were each about 20% of the mix. These last two areas are the ones that should benefit most in 2017 from the capacity and the management investments that we made in the second half of last year.","All in, we sold over 2,000 networking customers in the period with 40% of them being net new, which reflects the strong competitive position as well as provides expansion opportunities in the future. We\u2019re also encouraged by the results of our emerging SD-WAN business, while still small in absolute terms this new product was up nearly 200% in the quarter, 60% for the full year and should be an additional growth lever as we look into next year. Finally, our total SaaS revenue was up 8% year-on-year to 210 million in the quarter. The contribution from the GoTo business was 174 million, up 5%. And as for the merger of GoTo and LogMeIn, we expect this to close at the end of this month. Looking at the cloud-based services that are part of core Citrix, we recognized 36 million in revenue growing about 25% in the quarter. The bulk of this is coming from ShareFile, our secure data platform with other new offerings addressing the workspace-as-a-service and networking needs of our customers. So clearly we continue to see a shift in the way our products are being delivered evolving slowly towards a more ratable model where unit growth will exceed revenue in the short term. When we include the revenue that's coming from the Citrix Service Provider subscriptions plus our core cloud-based services and annual term license, the aggregate ARR was over 250 fifty million in Q4. We expect this trend to accelerate this year as more of our portfolio is being delivered as part of Citrix Cloud.","Turning to operations, we've driven a lot of efficiencies in the company over the past couple of years. The actions across the business were designed to generate permanent expense reductions, while reallocating investments towards those areas that will drive profitable growth in the future. In Q4, adjusted op margin was 35%, up more than 350 basis points from last year. We've been executing more than a year ahead of our stated goals and in 2016, for the full year delivered adjusted op margin of 31%. This focus on leverage has also helped drive an increased cash flow profile for the company. In Q4, our cash flow from ops was about 260 million. And over the trailing 12 months, we generated over 1.1 billion in operating cash flow. As you begin to model the core business for fiscal \u201917, I'd like to point out that historically between 80% and 90% of cash flow from operations can be attributed to the core business with the remainder coming from GoTo. Exiting Q4 we had nearly 2.7 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet which is up sharply from last quarter. Over the last several years, our stated target has been to utilize at least half of free cash flow for capital return, a level which we've clearly regularly exceeded. As you know this program has been on hold due to the pending separation of GoTo business. Today we announced that our Board has approved an increase of $500 million to our existing share repurchase program bringing the total current authorization to over $900 million. So we expect to be active again as soon as the GoTo LogMeIn transaction closes later this month.","So our growth strategy and operational programs have clearly been working, we\u2019re happy with the results and confident our plans as we look into the coming year. But before I discuss our expectations for 2017, I'd like to provide a little color around our plan. As always, at the beginning of the year we're maintaining a conservative outlook on the next four quarters. Our view on workspace services opportunity continues to strengthen and we expect cloud adoption to accelerate as we move through the year. In networking we're taking a conservative view on the timing of NetScaler cloud infrastructure and e-com orders which we expect to be more concentrated towards the middle of the year. And finally, since the GoTo transaction is expected to close by the end of this month, our guidance will exclude all of the GoTo results for the quarter and just include core Citrix. We\u2019ll begin reporting GoTo as discontinued operations beginning in Q1 and we'll plan to provide the historical comparison each quarter as we go through the year. So for 2017, we expect revenue between 2.81 and 2.84 billion for the core business which is an increase of 3% to 4% over 2016 and adjusted EPS for the year of $4.60 to $4.65 a share. For Q1, we expect revenue between 655 to 665 million and adjusted EPS of $0.93 to $0.95 a share. So we're feeling good about the continued improvement in results, and our product innovations and the early returns on cloud. We're also continuing to make those go-to-market investments around capacity that should drive additional growth as we move throughout the year.","So now I'd like to turn it over to Kirill to provide further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward.","Kirill Tatarinov","Thank you David. Hello and welcome everyone. As you see overall, this was a strong quarter demonstrating that our commitment to improve focus and streamlined execution is resonating well in the marketplace. Most notably this was yet another quarter of growth in workspace services proving that our efforts in accelerating product innovation and improving operational effectiveness is clearing working. We are also continuing to see great early traction of our cloud transformation with strong double digits growth. 2016 was a transformational year for Citrix where we focused on our core products and made significant strides advancing our long-term vision, strategy and culture. Our efforts have helped us outperform on profits and EPS, speed the pace of innovation, increase our competitive position and put us in a path for sustained growth in our core business and accelerated growth in strategic areas such as Citrix Cloud. As a next step in our transformation, we have transitioned Citrix to a unified functional organization bringing out three business units, three core business units into one agile structure enabling us to drive even stronger integrated innovation going forward.","Our progress positions us well for accelerated and sustained profitable growth in the years ahead. We\u2019re very pleased that our global field teams executed very well exceeding plan in all geographies in 2016. And with new leadership in place in APJ and overall strengthening of the team in EMEA and APJ, we\u2019re well positioned for even more success in the future. As always during the quarter, I had a direct opportunity to engage with our customers and partners in North America and EMEA. The feedback on the focused and reinvigorated Citrix has been overwhelmingly positive. Similarly, the feedback on our newly launched customer success services has been positive, with customers stating that this model of support has established a new standard for software maintenance in the industry. I'm also very encouraged by the record number of $1 million plus transactions and several seven figure cloud deals almost them. As more and more large enterprise embrace the cloud first approach to secure and manage their workspaces. Now a few extra comments on our solution areas.","With now three quarters of consecutive growth in workspace services or our Xen family of products, it is clear that our efforts on innovation and execution are delivering solid competitive edge. Our Americas team has yet again delivered double-digit growth with Xen family in the quarter. On the technology side, we continued with an accelerated quarterly update cadence for our cores and apps and depth of products delivering December release which featured expanded Microsoft integration, enhanced application monitoring and reporting tools. And now with acquisition of Unidesk and world best app layering technology we further expanded our leadership position. Our customers and partners have applauded the deal. With some more than 850 competitive wins in virtual client computing this quarter and our win rates continue to improve. And one significant win, a large European software company selected Citrix XenApp for their 15,000 users over the competition because of XenApp\u2019s clear position of market leader and also motivated by security concerns that the company had. In 2017, we set a priority for our sales and partners to lead with the Citrix Workspaces Suite which pushes us towards our mission to providing the industry most comprehensive and integrated platform for the secure delivery of apps and data. Already one large Q4 win, CenturyLink selected Citrix Workspace Suite choosing the full Citrix portfolio of products.","Moving on to our networking business. Coming on the heels of incredibly strong first nine months of the year and recognizing some unique characteristics and volatility of the service provider segment, our Q4 results for networking came well as expect. However, despite muted performance in Q4, we\u2019re enthusiastic about networking and the expanded the opportunities we have there. We are innovating rapidly, most notably with new NetScaler form factors enabled by our unique software defined approach and NetScaler Management and Analytics Systems or MAS which gives IT pros better analytics and visibility into security of network applications amongst other benefits. Our networking solutions are also shifting to a cloud delivery model, beginning with our recently announced release of NetScaler Gateway and management analytics service as a service.","Another great growth opportunity for Citrix is in fact, SD-WAN market. While still not yet maturely significant, our NetScaler SD-WAN solution grew strong triple digits. As an example of a large SD-WAN transaction, Pilot Travel Centers selected Citrix NetScaler SD-WAN for branch wide area network optimization across all of their retail solutions. And Pilot has already seen revenue growth from implementation of SD-WAN. In 2017, we've made it a priority for our sellers and our partners to increase focus on networking solutions by both driving better coverage and attach rates. Onto data delivery, ShareFile continues to prove itself as a leader in the business file sync and share markets growing over 25% year over year. As with previous quarters, we'll continue to drive rapid innovation with ShareFile, further improving usability and connectivity for our customers. Such secure data collaboration has proven valuable to companies of all sizes and has helped us accelerate our expansion into new market segments. For example, Erie Insurance, a mid-sized multi-line insurance company has standardized on Citrix ShareFile to empower their secure file sharing and collaboration capabilities across their national network of more than 5,000 independent insurance agents.","As we mentioned, our cloud transformation is picking up momentum and we're seeing strong demand from both existing and net new customers delivering overall strong double digit growth. For example, Partners HealthCare, the largest healthcare system in Northeast selected Citrix Cloud to support their Windows 10 migration, VDI expansion, while at the same time decreasing management overhead and infrastructure cost. Broad focus on cyber security continued to be a strong catalyst for Citrix. More and more customers recognized that Virtual Client Computing is in fact a key part of their cyber defenses. During the quarter, we significantly enhanced our overall positioning in the security space. At our annual sales and partner kickoff this month, we trained the entire team on our security positioning and highlighted our key security differentiators. This resonated tremendously well with our sellers and our partners alike. A points on our partnerships, I\u2019m very happy to report that our partnership with Microsoft continues to gain strength and momentum. On the product side, we\u2019re now delivering to what we promised last year, XenApp, XenDesktop and XenMobile Essentials for Azure.","Citrix also remains the only solution in market that can virtualize Skype for Business across platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux and now also Raspberry Pi. And Citrix ShareFile offers the only way to deliver Microsoft OneDrive in a virtualized environment. Our product teams are aligned, and our sales organizations are capitalizing on this effort. And one example of joint customer win with Microsoft, Vestus, the world's largest wind turbine company selected Citrix XenMobile and Microsoft MGM to provide true mobility for its global workforce of more than 15,000 users. And this was only one of many proof points of how a partnership is working. Additionally, earlier this month, we announced our new Citrix rated [ph] hyper-converged appliance program and Hewlett Packard Enterprise became the first partner to sign up for the program announcing the delivery of hyper-converged appliance running end-to-end Citrix platform in first half of this year. This will allow us to accelerate growth in mid-market where such full integrated out of the box solution are truly required.","On a broader set of partners, we\u2019re seeing stable growth and in 2017, we will continue to reinvigorate our partner channel. In fact as I mentioned earlier this month, we held Citrix Summit, the annual conference for our sellers and partner teams around the world. We have more than 4,000 attendees from 70 countries. We communicated a broad range of product innovations and new partnership deals, some of which I highlighted and mentioned earlier today. We\u2019ve also delivered a comprehensive cloud and cyber security training. The feedback from partners was incredible, in their own words, Citrix is back on track and demonstrating clear purpose and vision. On a personal note, today is my first year anniversary as CEO of Citrix. Looking back at the year, I'm incredibly proud of what we were able to accomplish. Our vision is clear, our strategy is firmly in place, we have the right leadership, and talented and unified team to drive sustained profitable growth and continue to delight our customers. I am pleased with our result and more enthusiastic than ever about the future of Citrix.","Thank you and we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow.","Raimo Lenschow","I got a new name, thanks. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions if I may. First of all, David, you were talking about like improved visibility into NetScaler into the middle of the year. Can you just expand a little bit on that one? Obviously that's going to be a key focus for investors. And then, Kirill, on the second question, it's on XenMobile. You mentioned like a joint project with Microsoft. How does the market understand like the Microsoft positioning, versus kind of what you guys or some other guys are offering in this space? Is it kind of competitive or like are people understanding where these two different products fit? Thank you.","David Henschel ","Sure Raimo, it's David, let me take that first question about NetScaler SSPs. It's the same story we've been talking about for a couple of years, nothing has changed, it\u2019s simply that we have pretty good visibility into a full-year demand profile from the cloud infrastructure vendors. It's just that those orders tend to be concentrated within certain quarters. Historically that's been two quarters per year that we've seen a big uptick and then two quarters the demand is a little bit less. Last year we had three very, very strong quarters and that's why we had forecasted Q4 and Q1 now to me a bit less strong. When we look at the full year, we feel very good about our position and so, what we understand at this point in time is that it's more of a Q2 to Q4 cycle this year. So nothing unexpected, I will add that you know as we talked about last quarter, one of the major investments we've made in the back part of last year was around capacity adds and leadership across networking and that was to not only expand the enterprise ADC, our ability to service customers and compete for business, but it's to also expand into what I would call Tier-2 cloud providers and other e-commerce so that segment of that business has a much broader base. And over the coming years, we'll be able to diversify away some of the volatility of it.","Kirill Tatarinov","Onto Microsoft question and specific to XenMobile and Intune. The core part of our Microsoft partnership that was announced mid of last year was complete alignment of our product roadmaps and with that we essentially eliminated any friction which may have existed in the past in enterprise mobility space. And from that point on our teams work very closely together and collaborated on delivering XenMobile essentials on Azure, which essentially expands Intune capabilities by adding unique Citrix functionality such as our secure apps such as more security profiles and settings, and also Micro VPN capabilities among most notable things. It is a special skew for EMS essentially expanding Microsoft capability. As you saw from at least one example that we highlighted and there were many more customers are clearly recognizing [indiscernible]. It's going to be generally available this quarter and we expect a great traction with Microsoft on that front amongst everything else we\u2019re doing with them.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard. Walter, your line is open.","David Henschel","Okay operator next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Philip Winslow.","Philip Winslow","See, I would not leave you guys hanging. Thanks for taking my question. Once again, congrats on a great quarter on the margin side. You guys have continued to come in ahead of consensus with the OpEx and the COGS lines for multiple quarters now. And David, I know you gave commentary about just operational efficiencies, and obviously, where you are in executing that plan. But as you kind of look forward into \u201917 versus the plan that you guys laid out over a year ago, on those cost savings, sort of, what has fully come out of the model, what's still left that can trickle into \u201917? And I think on the last call, you said for the core margin would be 32 to 33 for \u201917, any update on that too, just help us kind of correlate all these things, that could be great.","David Henschel","Sure, Phil. Absolutely. On core margins, yeah, 32, 33, same guide that we gave last quarter that continues into \u201917. In terms of what's left, I mean a lot of the work that we've been doing has been both to take cost out, permanent cost reductions that allow us to have better scalability and efficiencies and also a broad reallocation of costs to things that are going to drive growth long term and the investments we've been making across ShareFile data platform across Citrix cloud, across capacity ads and a few other areas in the business and we\u2019ll continue to make those, because right now, we've been driving nearly 1000 basis points of op margin over the last couple of years. We still expect to expand into \u201917, but the stated plan right now is a lot of those investments are expected to help accelerate growth. ","And so as we make that trade off, it's a profitable growth story. We will do both. And so, and as we fully expect to do, as we look into the year. In terms of things that we still have, I mean, there's a lot of efficiencies that are still out there. And I think more importantly, we're getting into a continuous cycle now where we can have an office of efficiency effectively set up that looks into continuous improvement and making that and ongoing discipline inside the company. And so, it's never over and in fact I still think there's a little room to run on that front. And we\u2019ll just balance based on how the year plays out, how much of that gets reinvested and how much of that becomes incremental profit.","Kirill Tatarinov","Yeah. And I think I would absolutely emphasize the point of improved discipline on managing OpEx and running disciplined operations, there's a new operating rigor that was introduced last year. It is firmly in place. There's a completely different cadence of how we manage expenses and how we manage headcount, how we manage allocations. There's also much improved sharing between different engineering teams that are now working much closer together, which helps us reinvest and producing great products and eliminate duplication. So all of those processes we believe will really help us drive the sustained profitable growth in \u201817.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard. Walter, your line is open. We\u2019ll move on to our next question. Our next question is from the line of Mark Moerdler. ","Mark Moerdler","Thanks. I appreciate. So, David, can you help us better understand the GoTo spinout impact on 2016, so we can compare the FY17 guide to the FY16 numbers. You said that GoTo contributed about 174 million of revenue this quarter, but can you give us a bit more on the annual revenue, the margins, the EPS impact, just something so we can get a sense of year-over-year growth within the guidance. Thanks. And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","David Henschel","Yeah. We're going to be actually providing the quarter-by-quarter as we go through the year and some of that is just, we don't want to incur all the cost upfront to go back and do those historicals. And right now, we're focused on actually the split in the spin. And so when we back out those numbers, we talked last quarter about how much the core business represented in terms of 2016 and that was core-core business, just Citrix only was about 2.73 billion of the consolidated numbers. So you can kind of back into the math on that upfront. In terms of what we're going to be providing, as you would imagine, when we're doing a spinout like this from an integrated operations, it will basically go down to about the operating income line. ","Below that, it's just a pure allocation estimate because those are all shared costs. So we\u2019ll be providing revenue breakouts and cost breakouts down to the operating line. In terms of how that business has performed, earlier in the year, it was running at an operating margin, the core business excuse me was running at operating margin that was about a point and a half higher than the consolidated entity. That number shrank a little bit as we went through the year. So exiting Q4, they were both around the same amounts. So I would expect the core business to be a little bit higher on a full-year basis and again we\u2019ll provide this quarter-by-quarter guidance as we go into the year.","Mark Moerdler","Can you also give us some sense on the time horizon or how to think about the $900 million buyback?","David Henschel","Yeah. We haven\u2019t stated a specific one, but we've been out of the market for a long time and accumulating a lot of cash. And historically, we've wanted to spend at least half of our free cash flow and we've usually been above that. And so once we get this separation done here at the end the month, we're going to be active again and don't really want to communicate exactly how much, but I would expect that we\u2019ll be back active managing dilution going forward and we continue to talk and look at capital structure on a broader basis. So it's not, I wouldn't call it mutually exclusive. These are two separate topics that we'll continue to talk about through the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey. It\u2019s actually [indiscernible] for Kirk Materne. Congrats on the strong year. Could you all discuss how you're thinking about M&A going forward in terms of both during the app delivery and app networking businesses?","David Henschel","Sure. In terms of M&A, we've been active obviously for a long time and looking at a lot of things that are not only incremental net new, so long as they're very related to our core strategy of absent data delivery, but more recently over the last couple of years, just changed our focus around discipline to make sure that the things we're adding are tightly coupled with our existing products that we can integrate with a low risk low capital outlay and we announced one of those in Q4. We had a tuck-in acquisition that was actually really hailed by our field and our channel partners where we're bringing frankly one of our ecosystem partners inside of Citrix, which just further extends the capabilities of the app delivery solution. Going forward, we'll look across the portfolio of both adjacencies and tech stock answer is really no change in strategy. I'd say our discipline is very, very high and as you can imagine, we\u2019re evaluating everything, but have a pretty high hurdle that we want to get over before we actually move forward.","Kirill Tatarinov","Absolutely. I would add Unidesk tuck-in is certainly indicative of types of transactions that fits square in our strategy, incredibly well received by our customers, partners and sellers alike and positions us for success with constantly on the outlook, but what's really important for us and staying true to our strategy of building the best in the world integrated cloud solutions for secure delivery of apps and data on any device anywhere in the world at any time. That strategy actually gives us permission to look at additional adjacencies and as the company has transformed, there's certainly ongoing activity that you should expect us to see, but everything we do, we\u2019ll stay very disciplined and very aligned with our strategy.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. Thanks very much. Kirill, can you talk about XenDesktop essentials briefly and the demand that you expect to see from managing Windows 10 Enterprise and Azure and then I just have a follow-up?","Kirill Tatarinov","Yeah. It\u2019s a great solution. The solution coming out of Microsoft Azure marketplace later this quarter. We see tremendous amount of increase and very strong interest, indicating that the solution will certainly be a very strong driver. First and foremost, as you may recall, in the middle of 2016, Microsoft essentially announced discontinuation of Azure remote access, which XenApp XenDesktop essentials will be replacing. And so first and foremost, we expect the solution to be very well received by those [indiscernible] Azure remote access. ","And then, we certainly see in lighter weight scenarios where the lighter weight solution would fit appropriately well, very high demand and obviously for customers who want to run virtualized Windows desktops and virtualized windows apps, the most logical place to go is Azure and so whether it's XenDesktop, XenApp essentials coming from Microsoft marketplace or full solution, expanded solution or the entire Citrix cloud suite coming from Citrix either way, they will get what they need.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Kirill. And then, David, so you did around 1.1 billion in cash from ops this year and taking the midpoint of the 80% to 90% [indiscernible] that you articulated, so that would I think get us to about 945 million as a starting point and I would assume you will be growing off that base, given revenue growth and margin improvement that you've guided to this year, but first of all, is that a fair assumption. And secondly, just given that GoTo was a more capital intensive business for you, can you give us a sense of what 2017 CapEx might look like as well?","David Henschel","Sure, Gregg. I think that yes, those are fair assumptions. In terms of CapEx, it's probably, it depends on exactly what we do from an infrastructure standpoint, real estate and some of the big items, but in general I would expect CapEx to be down a third or so from last year. It's probably worth noting in cash flow, I mean cash flow is a little bit tricky right now, just given the separation. And so Q4 was impacted by separation and Q1 will be as well. And so starting in Q2, we\u2019ll be back to normal. In this past quarter, there was a few kind of unique swings around prepaid, the increase in payables and decrease and a lot of those were just due to out of cycle items related to the separation and then the timing of VAT payments. And a few one-offs like that, but for the full year, I think that's the right set of assumptions. And yes, we do expect to grow off that base.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Heather Bellini.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what's driving the increased win rates in virtual computing, how are you seeing the competitive market evolve and how are you seeing the appetite for the solution? Thank you.","Kirill Tatarinov","Yeah. Thank you. Great question. And there are two things, two broad categories that's worth highlighting. First, changes that we implemented within Citrix and that secular trends in the industry. For Citrix, essentially with XenApp XenDesktop 7.12 that was introduced in December and previous releases, three other releases that were introduced early in 2016, we have the strongest product and our innovation engines run full cylinders and the team have done an amazing job, delivering great technology, truly rich functional set of scenarios with necessary level of simplicity that is required in modern applications. That was enhanced by two tuck-in acquisitions. We did small acquisition in Q3, Norskale that added end user experience and now, Unidesk. ","So that\u2019s one chunk of real important technology innovation that always drive success in technology world. Increased focus on the core, and it\u2019s really helped, not only on the bottom line, but also on the top line and really being clear with our sellers and with our partners what's important and what's the core and what's expected and how this aligns with our overall strategy. With that, implementing much improved discipline on competitor figures, setting up war room, making sure that we're really disciplined to track every competitive transaction and put the right level of attention and the right people on it. And that\u2019s certainly helped and that gave us a chance to essentially start tracking from about Q2 of last year how we\u2019re doing competitively. ","Frankly and honestly, that was not in place in the past. And then there are, I would say three secular trends in the industry that kind of raised the waterline of the overall virtual client computing marketplace. Number one is security and this is truly the case where cyber security is becoming stronger and stronger catalyst for Citrix and for the overall virtual client computing, computing industry. More and more customers realize that virtualizing the endpoint may impact the most secure way to run it, not putting anything on that end point is what truly and honestly secures it completely. So that\u2019s one. Then Microsoft upgrade cycle. In the second half of 2016, we started to see acceleration of Win 10 migrations. And we certainly know that many customers run their desktops virtualized and we actually see shift to more customers wanting to run them virtualized as same clients and the same form factor starts playing even in traditional desktop environments. ","And that\u2019s, we started to see that accelerating in Q3 and we saw more of that in Q4 as you saw in some concrete deal examples that we highlighted like partner healthcare. And last but not least, it\u2019s the cloud. The cloud will drive acceleration in the business. The cloud will be the catalyst. The cloud is starting to take much more concrete shape in conversations related to running workspaces for organizations of all cybers. And I think our alignment with Microsoft on cloud and on Azure is certainly helping us and I believe will be helping us more as the cloud transformation will occur.","David Henschel","Hey, Heather. This is David. I\u2019m just going to add a couple of points on workspace services that I think are really worth noting. So I called out in the prepared remarks that in the Americas, work space service grew double digits in the quarter. Net new license, that's actually the fourth quarter in a row of double digit growth. For the full year, it was about 15%. APJ is actually coming back due to some of the restructuring we\u2019ve done. They grew positive in the mid to high single digits on net new license. We are also seeing the continued phenomenon, where unit volume is growing faster than recognized license volume. Some of that's coming from CSP. Other elements coming from term based and then Citrix cloud. So I think, they all point to more robust market looking forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Abhey Lamba. Your line is open. We\u2019ll move on to our next question. Our next question is from the line of Ed Maguire. Ed, your line is open. We\u2019ll move on to Keith Weiss.","Keith Weiss","I wanted to see if I can get -- understand a little bit about the impact of the new software maintenance program, both on your overall billings growth, given the nice deferred that you've guys have posted this quarter, but also in terms of margins and EPS? If there's any way to quantify that impact? And I guess, the follow up there would also be, how much of the base has been transitioned to the new software program, and where can that go over the next year to two years?","David Henschel","Sure, Keith. I will take the last part of the question first. It's going to go to 100% of the base, the active base over a period of time. The way we have structured the customer success services is this. We have stopped selling subscription advantage on net new licenses as of January 1st. We will stop renewing subscription advantage as of July 1st. And so we've got this interim period right now where if customers are coming up for renewal on their subscription advantage, we will give them the opportunity to renew for one year. We are no longer doing multi-year renewals or anything else. We're actually going to start transitioning the base pretty aggressively in the second half of the year. Remind everybody that know in many cases, this is a material price uplift for customers. And therefore, we are stepping some of them up over the course of three years. ","So this will flow into the model beginning in the second half of this year, much more aggressively into 18 and 19. In terms of the percentage of the base that's already migrated, prior to Q4, we had roughly 20% of the active installed base had migrated to the maintenance offerings. During Q4, about 20% of the eligible base chose to upgrade voluntarily to the new program, even though it wasn't mandatory yet. And that is some of what's driving the really, really strong deferred revenue growth we saw. That plus some of the unique Citrix cloud transactions that we called out, which are all multi-year and just many, many multi-year transactions that tend to be aligned with the number of large deals like we saw in Q4. Hopefully that answers your question?","Keith Weiss","That's really helpful. Just to follow up. If there's any sense on how, on this view, the adoption of the new maintenance program might, how much of that is a catalyst to your margin trajectory next year? And then, my last follow-up is, if you\u2019ve got any comments on Europe, that business, in terms of did you see any weakness there, on how the trends performed there, particularly post-election and your views going forward?","David Henschel","Sure. In terms of the maintenance progression on actual margins, there is less impact in the current guidance in 2017. The impact will occur in a much more pronounced fashion in 2018 and \u201919 and that's because these are all ratable contracts. If we start a more aggressive migration in the back half of the year, there's only a small portion of that that actually hits the P&L. You'll see more of it show up in growth in deferred. In terms of customer adoption, we've actually had a tremendous feedback. It's one of those things that we spend a lot of time actually working with customers and partners and others to understand the value that we're delivering. ","And so this is not a simple migration to a -- back into a price increase, but really approaching it from what types of value do we need to add to customers and what type of incremental services can we give them to, a, make them very successful with their current implementations and, b, really give them the tools to migrate to the cloud when it's appropriate for their business. And so some of it is about uplifting opportunity and the rest of it is about really laying the foundation for the bigger opportunity over the next several years. And so it's I\u2019d say better than expected reception so far.","Kirill Tatarinov","Yeah. And I would just stress one thing than David just said, it is, don't think of it as a price increase and don't think of it as some folks in the industry have done in years past. This is truly new program with dramatically increased service. And every analysts and we spend time with all of the usual industry analysts aspect who studied this program provide us terrific feedback and really told us that this is game changing. And therefore, all the customers, we see this program, they see this sort of dramatic new modern way to deliver service from a software and cloud company versus what was there in the past. So it's not just price increase, it's much greater service and it's truly unique product that delivers terrific service to our customers. And we are really excited about it and therefore the feedback has been terrific.","Now, on the second part of your question, on EMEA, I had an opportunity to spend some time in EMEA during the quarter and we didn't see any anomalies. To be honest with you, unlike in past quarters, I did hear some anecdotal commentary from some of our partners and couple of our sellers in several large transactions that were delayed and those delays were blamed on BREXIT. Again, this is anecdotal evidence, but we didn't hear any of that in Q3. We\u2019ve heard a little bit of that in Q4. None of that were linked to the elections here in the United States. ","And overall, I would say our execution in EMEA have increased dramatically in Q4. Also, in prior quarters, we talked about some execution challenges in Northern Europe, specifically in UK and Ireland and I'm very pleased that during Q4, we\u2019ve brought on board new leader who will be based in the UK. She came to us from Vodafone. She has tremendous cloud background and networking background and we have very high confidence that we will see just as much improvement in Northern Europe as we\u2019re now already seeing in APJ, since we brought on board a new leader there in August.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Abhey Lamba. Abhey? Abhey, your line is open. So we have no other questions in queue at this time.","Eduardo Fleites","All right. Well, that\u2019s terrific operator. Well, folks, really thank you for joining us today. And thank you for following Citrix over the years and the past few quarters as we continue our journey to make Citrix greater than ever. We clearly have a very exciting year ahead of us, tremendous product roadmap, really new operating rigor and discipline to execute on all cylinders as we are -- as we move forward into 2017. So we\u2019re excited to see how our hard work is being validated by the results and we're very excited about the future. Thank you all very much and have a great rest of the day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. "],"5518":["Citrix Systems, Inc.

At the end of the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Eduardo Fleites. Eduardo, the floor is yours.","Eduardo Fleites - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's first quarter 2018 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be David Henshall, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Drew Del Matto, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems Investor Relations website. The webcast replay will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously, these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.","Additional information concerning these and other factors that may impact results is highlighted in today's press release and in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on the company's Investor Relations website.","Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I would like to turn it over to Drew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Drew?","Andrew H. Del Matto - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. We experienced positive results across Citrix in Q1. Our transition to the cloud continued to gain momentum, and our Q1 results were solid and above all of our guided ranges.","In summary, total revenue grew 5% year-on-year. Subscription revenue was up 49% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 32%, up more than 400 basis points versus last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.29 per share, up 34% versus last year, and cash flow from operations was a record $358 million.","Please note that we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606 in Q1 using the modified retrospective method. More details are posted to our Investor Relations website, but I'll share the key summary impacts.","In the quarter, the adoption of the new accounting standard drove approximately $10 million decrease in reported revenue, a $3 million benefit to operating expense and a net decrease to non-GAAP EPS of about $0.04. Combined deferred and unbilled revenue was negatively impacted by about $100 million. Again, please see our website for further detail.","Now looking back at Q1. Our Enterprise business continues to be solid. We closed 50 $1 million-plus transactions compared to 47 in the prior year with strength in technology, healthcare, financial services and government. There was a good balance across the portfolio with strength in both cloud and on-premise Workspace Services and Networking.","Next, let's take a closer look at Q1 results within our primary businesses. Workspace Services was up 3% year-on-year to $413 million with several noteworthy aspects. Q1 subscription contracts mix was 42% of new products bookings within the Workspace business, excluding installed base migration. Within subscriptions, bookings for Citrix Cloud and our CSP offerings continue to grow sharply. This was offset by a decline in on-premise term licenses, which is expected given the changes we made to our internal offerings. And we continue to see progress with our Customer Success Services program, which have redefined higher-value software maintenance offerings we implemented at the beginning of 2017.","The Networking business experienced good results across the product line as our investments in sales capacity and innovation are paying off. Q1 2018 Networking revenue increased 8% year-on-year to $209 million with an increasing contribution from subscriptions. Increasing demand balanced across both our SSP and Enterprise accounts drove our Networking business results. In fact, product bookings in both segments were up around 20% year-on-year. Finally, our Content Collaboration revenue was up about 15% year-on-year to about $45 million in the quarter.","Let's now turn to operations. In Q1, our adjusted operating margin was 32%, up more than 400 basis points from last year. We are maintaining a very disciplined approach to spending, as you would expect, while beginning to invest more into our demand generation and quota-carrying capacity over the next few quarters in order to support our growth and transition.","Cash flow from operations was a record $358 million, up 23%, bringing the trailing 12 months to over $1 billion.","Deferred revenue was $1.69 billion, up 1% from last year while down 10% sequentially. The majority of the sequential decline was due to the adoption of ASC 606.","At the end of Q1, we had over $2.2 billion in cash and investments, impacted in the quarter by the $750 million accelerated share repurchase program we announced in early February and a small acquisition of Cedexis. All-in, we repurchased 8.4 million shares in the period.","Now turning to Q2 2018 and full year 2018 guidance. We continue to expect an acceleration in the adoption of Citrix Cloud services and subscription-based offerings, which create some headwinds to reported results.","However, the strength of our first quarter and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our business outlook. We now expect for the full year 2018 revenue between $2.88 billion and $2.91 billion, adjusted operating margin of 30% to 31%, and EPS of $5.20 to $5.30 per share.","For Q2 of 2018, we expect revenue between $710 million and $720 million and adjusted EPS of $1.18 to $1.22 per share.","Now I'd like to turn it over to David to get further color on the quarter and our focus areas looking forward.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Drew, and welcome, everyone. As Drew noted, Q1 was a solid quarter. We posted strong upside in the financial results, while, at the same time, we're continuing to execute on the operational transformation across the business and across our go-to-market. I'm really proud of how the team has been performing through all this change.","More importantly, partners and our customers are embracing the subscription model, really driving the conversion that we introduced in October of last year. Despite the headwinds from the mix shift, the reported numbers were stronger than anticipated in Q1, largely due to the above-plan new product bookings in both Workspace and Networking.","In fact, our total revenue growth of 5% compares to the 1% we saw a year ago, while, at the same time, the contribution from subscription license revenue increased from 10% to 15% of total revenue. You couple this with strong cost discipline, and we demonstrated a lot of upside against margin and EPS results from a year ago.","Looking specifically at the business transition, I want to reiterate the important metrics we'll be using each quarter to measure and communicate progress.","So in Q1, subscription revenue, which accelerated for the fifth straight quarter, grew 49% to over $103 million, as Drew mentioned. The mix of product bookings coming from subscriptions was 30% versus 24% a year ago. Remind everybody that for this current fiscal year, we're targeting up to 40% of the mix coming from subscription this year.","In Q1, the growth rate from subscription bookings was just about 40%, and the balance of unbilled revenue from subscriptions increased over $10 million sequentially.","What's happening in the business is that customers are realizing that Citrix Cloud can add a lot of value to their own initiatives, in terms of simplifying the adoption of hybrid cloud, but also in accelerating their own transformation through speed and flexibility. In fact, roughly 20% of all of our large enterprise deals in the quarter were cloud.","In total, Citrix Cloud now includes more than a dozen services, with options for SaaS in hybrid models as well as cloud services for those customers with only on-premise implementations to help them better manage and monitor more effectively.","So let me give you a few use cases, customer examples from Q1, to really highlight the diversity of what we're seeing. As part of their transformation of information technology services and in support of their growing digital business, Finning International, which is the world's largest distributor of Caterpillar products and support services, is moving from a traditional IT outsourced model to a cloud service delivery model on a global scale utilizing Citrix Cloud XenApp Service on Azure.","In the service sector, ServiceMaster, a long-time customer began the migration to Citrix Cloud to simplify management and performance going forward while, at the same time, they're expanding into mobile services \u2013 mobile applications to improve the productivity in their customer-facing teams by unifying apps for scheduling, contracting and other job functions. ServiceMaster committed to a three-year cloud contract validating their belief in our strategic direction.","BRF in Brazil, which is one of the world's largest food processing companies, selected Citrix Cloud over one of our competitor's solutions. And this multiyear contract provides this customer with the technology to securely deliver their innovative apps to any device all over the world. Their customers reside in 150 countries with a large variety of devices, networks and languages. Citrix provides simplicity and improved end-user experience regardless of those locations.","And finally, one of the top five property and casualty insurers in the U.S. made a strategic decision to begin moving workloads into the public cloud. So working together with Microsoft, we developed a joint solution for this customer in Q1 that included Citrix Cloud and Microsoft Azure resource zones. This company has traditionally operated their Citrix environment in separate geographies. The cloud initiative drove them to consolidate the right key resources and centralize the management of these environments throughout the world, resulting in a five-year commitment to Citrix to more than 35,000 users.","This represents commitment with a long-standing customer where we beat competitive pressures by sharing a strategic vision, but also helping jointly develop our cost model that fit their expectations for the cloud. Our close working relationship with Microsoft gave this customer the comfort that we would be there to jointly support them throughout their journey. These are just a few examples of why Citrix Cloud services are proving to be so valuable for both new and existing customers and why we're winning these types of opportunities against competition. These examples also demonstrate how our customers are committing for multiple years, validating our direction as part of their current and future roadmaps.","So let's talk about Networking for a minute, as this business was strong in Q1 across both SSP, the hyperscale cloud segment of the business and the Enterprise accounts, as Drew mentioned. What's driving this is really three factors. First, for customers focused on the digital workspace, the integration that we've built across the portfolio create demonstrable added value for security, identity and performance. For ADC accounts, our industry-leading software first approach gives them unique flexibility to embrace hybrid cloud. And for all customers, Citrix Analytics is proving to be a big differentiator for visibility into the network, the workspace, the user and other important areas.","In addition to these specific points, customers are responding to the roadmap for the for the secure digital perimeter, which will be increasingly important as more and more workloads move to the cloud as businesses continue to adopt native web and SaaS apps.","Couple of Networking win examples from Q1 include, one of America's largest insurance companies purchasing Citrix Cloud as a new ADC standard to replace two of our main competitors' solutions. And they did this due to the performance advantages and flexibility of our architecture. With Citrix Networking, this customer is now able to increase their overall capacity, throughput and instances to accommodate current future growth.","Another example is a global investment bank, which selected Citrix as their traffic management platform due to our security capabilities and analytics, which provide deep insights to speed up issue resolution and the ability to manage their entire Citrix Networking estate. This also represents another competitive replacement.","And finally, SD-WAN, continues to scale and we're seeing larger deployments. Q1, for example, one of the leading vehicle insurers in the U.S., Esurance bought SD-WAN to reduce the risk of revenue impacting network outages and to provide better visibility in the performance of apps. This strategic decision helps Esurance reduce MPLS costs while increasing reliability for branch offices. And lastly, Content Collaboration remained strong. As you know, we've been pivoting this business to focus more directly on the Enterprise and on integrating with the Citrix Workspace. Since we can deploy content solutions seamlessly across the Citrix Cloud, private cloud or on-premise, our hybrid strategy remains a key differentiator in this space.","So looking back on Q1, our products and engineering teams delivered advances really across the portfolio, driving innovation at a record pace. Some of the highlights include Citrix Analytics, which is a cloud-based service that correlates performance and security data across all Citrix offerings, generates intuitive and actionable insights to help IT administrators manage user security threats more effectively protect apps, improve app performance, and enhance operations.","We also introduced real-time traffic management capabilities across public clouds, data centers, CDNs and ISPs to help enable dynamic infrastructure orchestration. This is based on the new Cedexis service that captures hundreds of billions of new data points each quarter. SD-WAN for service providers is new. And finally, we delivered network services for identity and access management and application security.","So overall, one of the other benefits of focusing on services is increased pace of innovation. Not only has the rate of patent applications tripled over the last two years, but we can now deliver hundreds of independent updates per quarter to our services in addition to the continued innovations for our on-prem clients. So, strong focus on product innovation, on delivering value for our customers and incredible user experience is driving total product and subscription bookings, which grew in the high single digits in Q1.","Entering Q2, I feel good about our momentum and purpose. We're more aligned and more focused on customer success than I've seen Citrix in a long, long time. Clearly, our financial results are strong, and we're proving that you can drive a cloud transition and accelerate revenue and margins together. It's a powerful combination.","Looking forward, the focus remains on our three strategic motions. First, accelerating to the cloud to help our customers work the way they want to, on-prem, hybrid or the public cloud; second, unifying the portfolio to deliver a simple intuitive elegant workspace with a premium on experience, security and choice; and lastly, extending it into new areas to help our customers meet the demands of the future while driving incremental revenue and relevance for Citrix in areas, such as security, analytics and the secure digital perimeter.","It's clear that our customers are looking to operate in a multi-cloud hybrid cloud world, and Citrix is clearly positioned to help provide simple, secure and unified solutions to help them address these challenges and simplify their roadmaps. In a couple of weeks, we will be with thousands of our customers at our Annual Synergy Conference in Anaheim, where we're also going to be hosting an Analyst Meeting. The theme of the event is around the future of work and the reality that all customers are facing with respect to work styles, mobility and security.","We're going to be highlighting a number of important new innovations in the Citrix Workspace designed to help our customers realize the full benefits of cloud while avoiding complexity and security challenges. The new Workspace and Networking services secure and integrate technologies, platforms, devices and clouds, ensuring that organizations can operationalize the future of work and drive their business forward. Really hope that everyone can join us, either virtually or in person. We're excited about the future, and I'm confident in the progress we're making so far in 2018.","Thank you. And as always, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Philip Winslow. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, thanks guys and congrats on a great start to the year. A question for you, David, just wanted to focus on Workspace Services a bit. Obviously, the momentum you're seeing on the cloud subscription side is pretty strong here to begin the year. When you're talking to customers, what is actually the driver of the shift over to cloud subscriptions? Because obviously, you still have the license and maintenance model. What's the value add that you're seeing that's getting the shift idea over? And then just one quick follow-up to that.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Phil. It depends on the customer, of course. But overall, I'd say that on a simplified basis, the value is about reducing the complexity of the infrastructure, better overall user experience through the integrations that we've built, the security capabilities. And then further on, it's about being able to consume innovation on a much faster basis.","We're seeing customers that had started out with a pretty simple story around simplifying the management of a Citrix state to now realizing that they can broadly accelerate everything from disaster recovery initiatives to just other things that are going to accelerate their business, to onboard new users or M&A or customers much more rapidly.","So I think it's a good mix right now. Obviously, where we're going is to be talking much more about how customers accelerate their own businesses, and that'll open up a lot of use cases in the future.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then just a quick question on the delivery network and obviously the product booking number was strong there, too. I know this is a lumpy business and things can shift around quarter-to-quarter. But how do you think about Q1 and sort of just the outlook \u2013 relative to the outlook for the rest of the year there?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes, Phil. Q1 was a great quarter. I mean, I think Drew talked about this in his prepared remarks.","The one thing that I'd say about Networking was balance. If I look at the SSP or hyperscale cloud segment, both that and the Enterprise segment, both saw product bookings up about 20 points.","In terms of mix, SSPs represented between 40% and 45% of the mix, which is exactly what it was a year ago in Q1, so just good balance across the board. I think that the things that we've talked about that are working are the capacity adds that we've made over the last couple years, the investments in innovation, the integration with Workspace, and they're all coming together pretty nicely. So we're happy with the performance there.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thanks for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Robert Majek - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is actually Robert Majek on for Michael today. Congrats on the quarter, really strong EBIT margins. Can you just give us a little more color on what drove that, how sustainable that is? And furthermore, we're not too far off from your 2020 goal. How likely are we to see that goalpost get moved out at some point?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, Robert, we're not going to change 2020 yet. What we will do in sometime in the future is start to extend our multiyear model based on actuals and as we get more experience with the right pace of transformation.","I'd say specific to the quarter right now, we're operating with a lot of discipline. As you mentioned, we're up 400 basis points, 450 basis points year-on-year in terms of margin. We will continue to spend and invest on things like demand marketing, quota-carrying capacity, innovation and cloud infrastructure, I mean the normal things you would expect over the next few quarters.","But right now, the teams are just doing a great job. I think everybody's focused on execution and doing it in a disciplined manner.","Robert Majek - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. And just one more from me. You touched on it in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk a little bit more about the speed of the customer migration to CSS and the full Citrix Cloud? And how much of your customers now use each?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Robert, those are two different things. In terms of CSS migration, just to remind everybody, that is a \u2013 we're migrating our historical maintenance programs to Citrix Customer Success Services. That program is pretty much run a full cycle. It will by the end of \u2013 really, by the end of Q2, Q3, we'll have a reasonably full cycle. So we'll get all of the install base on that program, certainly by the end of this year, but the vast majority by the Q3 timeframe.","Remind everybody that that comes with a higher per license cost on an annual subscription for that. And that we are phasing in over a three-year timeframe for a lot of customers. So a little bit of impact this year and then more gradual impact as we go into the next couple of years.","In terms of customers on cloud, I mean, we've really been focused on net new whitespace up to this point. Last quarter, I talked about the focus on installed base. It's a motion that, you may remember, we called Trade-up and Transition. That's brand new. It's more of a second half ramp for us. First half is more focused on net new.","In fact, the TTU motion is, I'd almost call it a distraction at this point, because we're building out the infrastructure, as you'd imagine, to have common commercial agreements, common terms and the things you would need for longer term customers. So expect that to be more of a second half story.","Robert Majek - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. And I'll add my congratulations as well. David, subscription revenue is strong this quarter at close to 50% year-over-year growth, and you guys called acceleration prior to this. But how are you thinking about subscription revenue growth over the rest of the year?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we certainly think it's going to continue to accelerate. It won't be a straight line. Growth rates get harder, obviously, as you get to the law of large numbers. But that's what our focus has been. We've woven it even into our various compensation plans, because we want everybody inside the company fully aligned against transitioning not only the business model, but over time, transitioning all of our customers towards more of a continuous service engagement model. So it's a primary focus. It will continue to grow this year. How rapidly it accelerates? Probably a little bit of that is predicated on the installed base migration, which comes with a reasonable uplift. And as those customers start moving off of maintenance and onto Citrix Cloud, that's obviously a very, very large number. But again, like I said on the last question, that's more of a second half and into 2019 story versus short-term.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then if I look at revenue, so certainly, it was very strong in this quarter. Although if I'm not mistaken, your billings did decline by about 4% or I believe it declined by about 2%, if I adjust for unbilled revenue. And again, there's an accelerated transition to cloud although, if anything, I would have expect lower revenue rather than deferred. And so just wondering if there was anything else that you would call out with respect to the billings number.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, there was. Frankly, deferreds got a few moving parts in it this quarter. The largest of which is related to the adoption of 606 and the write-off there. Also, unbilled items had a fairly large adjustment. When you put the moving parts together and try to normalize deferred revenue, you get back to about a $30 million to $35 million sequential decline, which is right in line with what we'd expect on a normalized basis. And then on year-on-year, that would take it up somewhere between 10% and 11%.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ted Lin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Ted Lin on for Heather. Congrats on the quarter. Just a couple of questions for me. Can you talk about the competitive landscape in Workspace Services now that you have CSS and Citrix Cloud and how sort of win rates been trending?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes. Overall, competitive environment continues to be intense. It has been for a long time, so no real change on that front. I think the change from our point of view is stronger execution. We have been speaking a lot more about the future of Citrix Cloud, the benefits that customers are going to attain from that, introducing, as I've referenced in my prepared remarks, innovation in a lot faster clip. So the conversation with customers is about application management, regardless of whether those are virtualized or other forms of apps. It's about security, it's about compliance. It's about those types of things that are really critical to their business. But we certainly expect competitive landscape to continue to be very intense, so no change on that front. When we look at our win-loss, we referred to it last quarter, our win-loss has continued to improve over the last four, five quarters just in terms of the deals that we track and we're competing head-to-head. So I put that back to better execution on the field and just a rapid pace of innovation.","Ted Lin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then on churn rates, I think they've been relatively steady for you guys for the last couple of quarters. Just wanted to ask how they've been and how they're trending as you kind of head into year two of mandatory CSS migration. Thanks.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes. No change on churn rates. So, on-time renewal rates which is the easiest way to look at it in period has been unchanged.","Ted Lin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks. This is Tyler Radke on for Walter. So clearly, the subscription revenue outperformed relative to expectations in Q1. But it looks like maintenance revenue, after it declined sequentially. So I guess I'm wondering, how much of this subscription \u2013 and obviously the strong bookings of subscription, how much of this is coming from the installed base? And are you seeing customers just kind of move from Subscription Advantage into this Citrix Cloud or just trying to understand the moving parts, because it does look like maintenance revenue declined sequentially.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Tyler, I'd encourage you to go back and look at the way we have changed the reporting of revenue, because that will give you a better reconciliation, and all those details are available on our web. What's going on underneath the business is really net new bookings for both the CSP part of subscription and Citrix Cloud. Those are the two fastest-growing parts.","As I mentioned, the installed base, that Trade-up and Transition motion that was a very, very small part of the business this quarter. So I mean it is really \u2013 it's net new that's driving it at this point and not much else. That will change in the back half and into 2019 as we start pushing more in terms of installed base migrations. But as those become material, we'll call them out and break out the delta between installed base and net new.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So I guess, to clarify the first point, are you saying that maintenance was not down sequentially?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","That's correct. But I encourage you can go back and look at the revenue line.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned on the Networking business that you're starting to see an increasing contribution from subscription. Can you just remind us what the use case there is? I know in the CSP business, there's a piece of NetScaler attached to that, but what's kind of the main used cases for virtualized networking?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","The primary use case is in the Enterprise accounts, and they're something called pooled capacity. And effectively, what that does is allow customers pay subscription to share capacity across instances that are on-prem and think of it as a data center appliance, instances that are in the cloud as a virtual appliance. And it just gives them a lot more flexibility across their own infrastructure. The story is really about embracing hybrid cloud. And so just to give you one more data point, of the Networking product bookings, 11% came from subscriptions in Q1, and that's up from 5% a year ago. And that's really only in the Enterprise accounts where that tends to be a popular phenomenon.","Tyler Maverick Radke - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yeah, thank you. David, about a year ago, you had shared $200 million opportunity from CSS and $500 million opportunity from the cloud migration. Now that you've had some runtime and some customer feedback, how do you feel about those numbers? Are they still the targets we should think about, or do you think there's upside to those numbers?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Abhey, I think they're good targets. We haven't intentionally updated them necessarily. We'll take a look at it in the context of multiyear, but probably the best way to think about it is the pricing. And pricing, including the uplifts, have all held. And so no change on that front.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Got it. And quickly, any thoughts on how should we think about your propensity to initiate dividend given that you've repatriated cash now?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we've talked a lot about capital return. I think last quarter we indicated that given the changes that occurred with tax reform, we now have access to the large majority of our global cash flow, which opens up a lot of degrees of freedom.","And because of that, we would increase our intent. Obviously, absent M&A, our intent is to return about 75% of free cash flow to shareholders through various forms. We'll spend more time talking about capital at our Analyst Meeting in a couple weeks.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is actually Tom Mao on for Kirk. So just on the Networking business, those are some good results. Do you feel like you've gained some share in the quarter? And how are you thinking about the opportunity in the Enterprise segment of that market heading into the rest of the year?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah. We're definitely gaining share. I mean, the market's certainly not growing 20% year-on-year to the best of my knowledge. At least if I add up our competitors' results, that wouldn't point to that.","So I'd say the only answer is we're taking share. We're doing a good job. We've got a good product set, a good technology stack and a good story that's resonating with customers.","I didn't mention it really, but analytics is also proving to be a nice differentiator. We've started to introduce a broad analytics platform. The first instance as applicable to NetScaler is called MAS, Management and Analytics System. And customers really like that. It gives them a lot broad visibility and new and unique insights, and that's proven to be a good competitive differentiator.","So we're doing well across both, which is good because as everyone knows, the SSP segment is a little bit more volatile. And that's why we've been focusing on the Enterprise. And seeing this type of growth, I would not say it's sustainable, of course, just because the markets aren't growing that fast, but our ability to continue to take share we feel pretty good about.","Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And just one quick follow-up. You noted your Microsoft partnership being a positive as it relates to helping a couple customers move to the cloud. So when it comes to your own cloud offerings, do you think you're getting kind of a bit of a tailwind from some of the strong growth in Azure as \u2013 and Microsoft pivot to the cloud?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, they're really apples and oranges, I think. Azure growth is a bit independent. What customers are consuming Citrix Cloud for, which just to remind everybody is a collection of over a dozen independent services, including apps and desktops and mobile and networking and other things.","We run our infrastructure on Azure, and then we give customers the flexibility to run their workloads wherever it makes most sense. They can actually run them on-prem if they want. They can run them in Azure, in AWS, in GCP, in Oracle Cloud, and that's an important part of the story. Cloud choice and cloud portability is really important.","When it comes to Windows-based workloads, obviously Microsoft is a tremendous partner. And we do a lot of work not only on the Azure front, but work that we've done together regarding Windows 10 migrations, embracing and extending the EMS stack, work that we're doing to deliver Windows to Chromebooks. I mean, there's a lot of different use cases there that just make it very synergistic to work with our local counterparts on the Microsoft side. And together, we can create really compelling solutions for customers.","Tom Mao - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brad Reback. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks very much. Two quick questions. First, the share count expectation for the full year, what should we be using?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Good question. Probably somewhere between about 138 million and 140 million.","Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. I'm sorry, go ahead, Dave.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I was going to say make \u2013 million, 138 million to 140 million.","Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. And then, Dave, as we think about cash flow for this year, obviously, a fantastic start to the year. Is there any reason to think that cash flow wouldn't be higher this year than 2017?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, we haven't guided cash flow, so that's my only hesitation there. Cash flow is very Q1, as you pointed out. I mean, Drew, who's joined the team, has got a very strong focus on cash flow yield and the levers on that front. And so, we're looking at all the things that we can do to drive cash flow. And I think the one variable, of course, is just unbilled revenue, which is continuing to grow. And that's just a function of customers signing up for longer-term contracts with shorter-term billing cycles. And so that's the one variable. But when you put those two together, we're seeing good results.","Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on a strong start to the year. I guess I wanted to ask a question on product bookings. I think you mentioned it was sort of high single digits, which is a very strong result. But I think the subscription bookings mix, correct me if I'm wrong stood still at 30%. And just wanted to get some color on how we think the progression of that subscription mix evolves over time, why was it a little bit stagnant this quarter? And what type of assumptions should we be using for full year guidance in terms of that subscription bookings mix?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes, I wouldn't call it stagnant for the quarter. I mean it's best to look at it on a year-on-year basis. It was low 20%s a year ago, and it's 30% in Q1. So it's definitely an improving part of the story. And then what's offsetting that a little bit, maybe what you're trying to pick up on is the strength in perpetual networking. And so that influences the metric. If I look at Workspace specifically, Workspace is now up to 46% coming from subscriptions as compared to 35%, 36% a year ago. And those subscription bookings were growing about 40%. So all-in, it's moving exactly where we like it to be. In terms of the overall mix \u2013 and this is all products together, I stated last quarter that we were looking to get as much as 40% of the mix coming from subscriptions this year. And so I think you should \u2013 it's fair to expect that the percentage is going to continue to ramp sequentially throughout the year.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just to clarify. When we think about targeting about 40%, is that sort of an end of the year metric we want to get to 40% or for the full year you expect that mix to be around 40%?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","It's a full year metric. And it will ramp. And depending upon how successful we are maybe with installed base migrations, exiting the year is where you've got a little bit more levers. But as I've said a couple of times, right now, the focus is on net new, on whitespace, on driving new license growth. And so we'll break that out and just show you how the two things come together as we get into the second half of the year.","Sanjit K. Singh - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, David.","Operator","There are no further audio questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I want to thank everybody again for joining us today. We're happy with the results coming out of Q2 or coming out of Q1 and then going into Q2 and the progress that we're making across multiple facets of the business.

A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I'd like to turn it over to David Henshall, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. David?","David Henshall","Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As you can see, we continue to show great progress with the operational initiatives we introduced last year. We\u2019re focusing our energy towards our core strategy, the secure delivery of apps and data, really setting the company up for even better results, efficiency and growth as we look forward.","As you can see from the release, total revenue was up 9% year-on-year in Q1 with perpetual product license up 10% and SaaS up 17%. Adjusted operating margin jumped to 29%. Adjusted EPS was $1.18 per share, up 80% from Q1 a year ago, and we generated a record $340 million in cash flow from operations. ","In total, we closed 51 $1 million plus transactions across product and services, an increase of 30%. The Americas region booked the majority with 42 of these, while EMEA had 5 and APJ had 4. ","A couple of points worth noting was that the average value of these large deals increased significantly from last year and at a product level there was good balance across the portfolio with roughly half coming from Workspace services solutions and half from delivery networking. ","From a geo perspective, when you exclude SaaS, the Americas was really the big driver in the quarter with revenue up 13%. EMEA finished up 1% while results in APJ declined by 8% year on year. Since our restructuring last year occurred earlier in the US versus the other geos, the Americas teams really had the most time to stabilize and adapt to this new structure, the key contributor to this performance. ","Next, let's take a look at the Q1 results within our three primary groups. Our workspace services business grew 3% to about $400 million, including flat license revenue. Really more than any other, workspace services should benefit from the work we're doing to simplify our focus and strategy. And as we\u2019ve reviewed before, there's a number of really specific initiatives we're driving to accelerate growth in this area through faster innovation, a more verticalized focus and aggregation of our unique assets. ","Within this business, there's a few dynamics I'd like to point out. First, growth in the workspace suite which is our comprehensive solution for secure app and data delivery was up more than a 100%, contributing 8% of license revenue as compared to just 3% a year ago. ","Second, we continue to grow our CSP subscriptions where partners primarily utilize XenApp to deliver cloud based offerings to their customers. Overall, CSP revenue grew over 30% in the quarter. ","Third, customer interest was more focused on application delivery versus DDI in Q1, lifting XenApp standalone license sales by more than 10% from Q1 a year ago. And finally, we saw really good results in the Americas geo for overall workspace service license. In total, it grew 7% and reflected the success of the restructuring within this business. This compares to flat year-on-year license growth in EMEA and a decline of 24% in the APAC region.","Next, let's look at the delivery networking business where total revenue increased 20% in the quarter to $195 million. This includes license revenue growth of 25%. Focusing on NetScaler, I\u2019ll remind everybody that the business is essentially made up of three segments: cloud service providers, Citrix solution sales and enterprise ADC. Demand from the cloud providers continues to be really strong, contributing more than 60% of sales in the period due to growth in public cloud and cloud services, plus the addition of more than 100 new customers in the segment as we expand the opportunity base. ","Solution attach sales represented over 10% of the mix in Q1 with the number of app and mobile opportunities that included networking as part of the overall Citrix solution, up about 30% from a year ago. Core enterprise ADC was about 25% of the mix in Q1 and we're beginning to see early traction from the new NetScaler SD-WAN products which are addressing the nascent market, that\u2019s expected to grow significantly over the next few years. All in, we sold to over 2100 networking customers in the period with about a third of them being new. ","Finally, with our SaaS services, revenue in the quarter approached $200 million growing in the mid-teens. About 85% of the SaaS revenue has been generated by the GoTo solutions that we will be spinning off later this year. The spin project overall remains on track for the second half and we expect to provide more detail in the performance of this unit within the Q2 timeframe. ","The majority of the other SaaS revenue was coming from ShareFile our secure data platform. In Q1, this business grew 40% and is being driven by integration with our enterprise solutions and enterprise sales promotion. ","Turning to operations. We've obviously shown rapid increase in margins over the past few quarters despite funding incremental investments in our growth businesses and certain GoTo market areas. As we've repeatedly discussed, our restructuring plans across the company are intended to generate permanent expense reductions and allow the company to execute more efficiently while at the same time driving greater scalability in the future. ","In Q1 we posted 29% adjusted operating margin, up over 900 basis points from last year, and the highest Q1 in over a decade. We're obviously well on our way to achieving the 30% plus goal for fiscal \u201817. The focus on the leverage has also helped to increase cash flow from operations, which was a record $340 million in Q1 and $1.1 billion for the trailing twelve months. This translates into approximately $2.18 per share in the quarter and over $6.83 per share for the past four quarters. ","And finally, we remained active on our share repurchase program, buying back about 850,000 shares last quarter.","Before I wrap up, let me talk about the current outlook and expectations for Q2 and for the full year. Our operational programs are clearly working. We're happy with the results so far and confident in our plans for the year. At the same time we want to remain mindful of the potential disruptions that can occur with any restructuring, the GoTo spin project and the significant revenue upside that we delivered in Q1. With that, we intend to remain conservative with all of our assumptions for Q2 while at the same time still increasing current expectations. ","So for Q2, \u201916 we expect revenue in a range of $810 million to $820 million and adjusted EPS of between $1.12 and $1.15 per share. For the full year \u201916 we're increasing our expectations to include revenue between $3.34 billion and $3.36 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.90 to $5.00 per share. I\u2019ll remind everybody that this guidance represents all of the businesses, including those that are part of the planned GoTo spin.","So now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Kirill to provide further color on the quarter and our focus areas going forward. Kirill? ","Kirill Tatarinov","Thank you, David. Hello and welcome everybody. Obviously I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter on both the top line and the bottom line. It's clear that our efforts to refocus the company are starting to work. ","As we simplified our portfolio and sharpened our message, it made it easier for our sellers and channel partners to execute and deliver. This is really the case where refocus and restructuring is producing not only bottom line results but also driving the revenue growth. In particular, I'm really excited about double-digit growth in license revenue. All in all, this was another quarter of great execution by our worldwide sales team. It also gives us confidence that the new commercial leadership together with a revitalized channel program sets us up on a path for continued healthy execution. ","With a large number of significant customer adds, we continue to demonstrate growth in our targeted industry verticals, especially in public sector, financial services and health care where customers are transitioning from other virtualization networking and mobility providers to Citrix. ","Specifically, John Hopkins has chosen Citrix XenDesktop for VDI deployment, expanding our longstanding application virtualization partnership. The decision to replace the competitive offering was driven by the need to unify their client virtualization solutions and improve performance. ","On the network delivery side, Salem Health moved from another vendor to Citrix NetScaler because of the seamless integration with the rest of our portfolio, richness of the experience and reduced TCL. In enterprise mobility, we were selected multiple times over competition due to our unique capabilities such as microVPN for application security and our integrated cross device platform. Customers choosing XenMobile included the country's leading commercial real estate development firm and a major energy provider. These were all great wins and they are just a few of many examples where Citrix was chosen over the competition.","Our engineering teams performed very well in Q1 and product delivery was strong. Specifically, we announced and delivered capabilities to accelerate and simplify the deployment of Microsoft Skype for business into enterprise. We see very strong interest among the largest customers deploying Skype for business to roll it out on Citrix virtualization infrastructure.","Overall we see our workspace services business trending very positively. In addition to introducing new releases for the entire Xen family of products this quarter, we also launched our new secure browser service which expands secure remote access to web and SaaS applications. ","Q1 was also a big quarter for networking innovation. We see a growing interest in our advanced SD-WAN capabilities that we announced in the quarter. We also hit a new performance milestone for the industry, releasing Virtualized NetScaler VPX with delivery speeds starting 100 gigabytes per second. In Q1, we also released NetScaler CPX. Basically NetScaler in a Docker container giving dev ops teams the production grade tools they can use to speed development of new apps. We also expect NetScaler CPX to help accelerate IoT strategies. ","Finally, we have further extended the enterprise class security and usability of our ShareFile portfolio, allowing customers to securely share data and files from any of source, or location on premise in the cloud or across other file sharing services. Overall I feel great about product deliverables in Q1. I feel they set us really well for the future and I'm super excited about the product roadmap. ","I\u2019d also like to give you a bit of a context on how we're evolving the Citrix strategy. Organizations of all size is experiencing dramatic changes in the way businesses operate and the way people work, moving more workloads to mobile devices into the cloud and across an array of networks. The growing number of new connected things or end points are creating huge volumes of data that need to be accessed, secured, transported and managed. ","And as I approach this mythical 90 days milestone as CEO of Citrix, there are two recurring themes that I'm hearing in my dialogues with customers, partners and key industry analysts. First, CIOs, IT networking professionals feel overwhelmed by the heterogeneous environment they're being asked to manage today. They're even more concerned about all the new cloud apps, mobile devices and other connected things they're being asked to control. Cyber security is the top concern for all of them and therefore their ability to securely deliver apps and data to their people is top of mind. ","The second thing I learned from several surveys and direct dialogue with customers and the industry is that the Citrix brand is very well trusted and that our customers really love working with us. They love our products and the value they deliver. However in many cases, they don't yet see our end-to-end strategy, the breadth of our portfolio and how the whole is more than the sum of the parts. And this is precisely where I feel Citrix has a huge opportunity. It all starts with our vision. We aim to power a world where people, organizations and things are securely connected and accessible to make the extraordinary possible. And our strategy is to build the world\u2019s best integrated technology services for secure delivery of apps and data anytime, anywhere, on any device from any cloud. We enable people to work and live better by giving them secure, reliable and performance enterprise store front, get access to all the apps and data they need to excel at their jobs. ","Security is the core underlying feature and the most important outcome of deploying Citrix technology with our network delivery through NetScaler, workplace services through Xen family, and secure file and sync sharing through ShareFile, all integrated and working together to deliver on the singular mission. We will provide more details on our strategy in the upcoming analyst day at synergy event next month.","But even today's results clearly demonstrate that the market is beginning to validate our vision and our strategy. When we examine the primary reasons why we're winning in the market, it\u2019s because of our reliable product performance and scalability, the openness and flexibility of our solutions, low TCO and our ability to provide it all as integrated solutions working together.","Thank you. And now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow ","Hey congratulations to a great start guys and Kirill, welcome on-board. First question for you, Kirill. Can you talk a little bit about -- you came from Microsoft. Microsoft has their own mobile solution. How do you envision that relationship with Microsoft to evolve for Citrix going forward with you on board now? ","Kirill Tatarinov","Yes, thank you very much and thanks for the welcome. Obviously Citrix and Microsoft have a longstanding history of partnership and terrific relationship. And that partnership certainly continues and expands to many areas. I think the work that we've done together on Skype for business is one example of that terrific partnership. The work that we're doing with Microsoft on Windows 10 and helping Microsoft customers roll out Windows 10 quickly is another example of that partnership. And we're looking for many other ways to collaborate and we continue to work very closely together in many other areas, including enterprise mobility.","Raimo Lenschow ","Okay, perfect, thank you. And David, one question, like you obviously had a very very strong start to the year on the operating margins. How much of that was just coming -- stuff coming through quicker than expected versus actually you were identifying new areas? Thank you. ","David Henshall","Raimo, if you're asking in terms of -- from the expense point of view, obviously largely it\u2019s a function of [Indiscernible] plus expense but our restructuring is a little bit ahead of plan. I mean, we've been executing across the company very effectively. I think we've taken a bottoms up approach as we discussed over the last couple of quarters and this just allows the teams to really really own the business and own the restructuring items. I think we're just doing a great job across the company. So obviously we're taking up our full year margin expectations by about 100 basis points already here in Q1. So really feel good about that as well. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America - Merrill Lynch. ","Kash Rangan ","I\u2019d like to add my congratulations as well. When I look at the way in which you beat the operating income, more than two-thirds of that came from gross profit beat, so it doesn't look like it's purely an expense reduction story. So can you talk to the drivers of upside performance on the Xen side, and I think clearly for years we've been hearing Xen license flat to down, so this time it's flat which is obviously a nice positive reversal. And also I don't believe that we\u2019ve seen a strong double-digit growth on the networking side. Can you just talk to the industry fundamentals versus how much of this is fundamentals in your end industry versus your execution, and the color on why Asia Pacific was down so much as well, notwithstanding otherwise a great result? Thank you so much.","David Henshall","A few questions in there, so let me parse that out a bit. Overall talking about the industry and the demand environment, I\u2019d say that the big stories in the quarter were the Americas performance, really did a great job, drove a lot of the revenues \u2013 lot of the revenue upside as well. So those teams have been working through the restructuring from really the beginning of \u201815. They're just coming along. We\u2019re a little bit further behind, when it comes to the other two regions in terms of the work that we've been operating against. ","From a product standpoint, yes. NetScaler had a terrific quarter again, similar to -- really the last nine months have been very strong. It\u2019s a combination of strength across the big trends around cloud build out, cloud services et cetera. We're also continuing to expand the customer opportunity size. I called out more than 20% growth in customers within that segment. Interestingly enough we're also seeing a pretty rapid growth of NetScaler being consumed as a cloud service. And so while still only a kind of mid single digits of the mix, that business is growing well over 100% as well. ","Shifting gears and talking about workspace services, couple of things to point out. Clearly we've been making good progress over the last several quarters. Some of the stats that we referenced in the prepared remarks, the suite being the complete solution for talking with customers about app and data delivery, that was up about 100%. The overall CSP business which we remind you is full subscription, was up about 30%. And one data point that I didn't put in the prepared remarks but it's also interesting is that when I look at units -- units are actually growing year on year in the mid-single digit range and that's just a function of the mix of license type. So overall for the workspace services business, about 18% of license this quarter was coming via subscription. That compares to 14% a year ago. We've got a couple of different dynamics in play. But the overall message is that we're up into the right across all of our major product areas. We're seeing terrific execution out of the Americas. We were happy and above kind of our internal expectation in multiple product areas and we still see further upside because there's more work to do. ","Kirill Tatarinov","Yeah, perhaps just a couple of things on the secular trends that we're seeing that are clearly playing the role in driving results for the business. On the networking side, we all see the tremendous build-out of the data centers that continues and NetScaler offering unique capabilities in a software defined fashion truly participates in that buildout and that's what we\u2019re seeing the growth in the cloud provider segment. At the same time the growth in ecommerce and the fact that even those companies that historically weren\u2019t participating in delivery of online goods and services are now right in there and they need to increase their networking throughput and capacity. That plays a significant role and of course many view NetScaler as essentially security product -- part of their cyber security strategy. And that's another trend that plays to that. ","On the app virtualization and on the overall workspaces services, XenApp is \u2013 we\u2019re seeing significant interest in XenApp. And we see a significant interest in large customers going to virtualized application. And we see actually good growth in that particular product. From the trends point of view, I would say, the introduction of Windows 10 in the enterprise is starting to be a driver that we're seeing and many large customers that I had a chance to have a dialogue with in the last few weeks certainly are looking at XenApp and XenDesktop as a very significant important infrastructure for them to roll out Windows 10 in the enterprise. And we obviously expect that to grow and accelerate and continue and the new product introductions that happened in Q1 will only help with that also through the type of business and secure web browser. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi.","Walter Pritchard ","Hi, thanks. Just following on, on the last question. This XenApp resurgence, I think many of us are trying to understand. You saw good business there last quarter. And you've had like the 7.6 release which I think may have released some pent-up demand. Kirill, can you help us understand just how sustainable you think growth I guess in XenApp license is? And maybe as part of that, could you highlight some of the use cases or value propositions beyond the sort of generic app virtualizations that are driving demand there? That product has gone through sort of phases of growth and maturity and it's surprising to see how well it's doing. ","Kirill Tatarinov","Well, I think it's worth remembering that about two or three years the company went through very significant engineering effort to lay out DDI, XenDesktop and XenApp on the same infrastructure. And as we've seen in some examples and John Hopkins in particular that we mentioned. We see customers who want to run both virtualized desktop and virtualized app off the same infrastructure. And that\u2019s becoming more and more prominent and we see more and more of that. We also see customers who want to essentially create one single store front for all of their employees to access their workspace whether it\u2019s virtualized desktop to access, virtualized app or a file. They basically want to create the enterprise portal, enterprise store for them to use and that's precisely where the unification plays important role and where all of that working on the same infrastructure is quite significant. These are just a couple things that we're seeing in that going through many customer discussions. To me sort of create both excitement of what happened the last couple quarters but at the same confident that we see some bright future for XenApp in particular. ","Walter Pritchard ","And then David on the cost side, the one area that stuck out to us was the R&D spend, which was down -- because we calculate somewhere in the mid-teens year over year. That strikes me as, maybe down more than it should be or more than it can be for some sustained period of time, could you help us understand what's driving that and how we should think about your level of R&D spend going forward?","David Henshall","Yeah, I wouldn't focus too much on the individual line items quarter to quarter. Let\u2019s get a couple more quarters into the year. There's really two things. The first of the reason I say that is that there is always individual projects going on that may or may not have large consulting expense. There\u2019s events, other things that flow through there. The second one is, a large part of our focus in streamlining was around the portfolio. And so as we have removed or sold or shut down product initiatives, that comes with the expense that was everything from engineering through support through sales et cetera. So that's really what you're seeing there. Overall we've talked about freeing up capital so that we can reinvest in the areas that are strategic, that are going to drive growth long term. And that\u2019s the core part of the strategy and we\u2019re executing on that. So overall R&D somewhere running in that 12% to 16% of revenue is pretty difficult. And I think that's where we're going to be as well. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini ","Great, thank you. I guess, David, I had a question \u2013 two questions. The cloud providers, I believe you said they were 60% of sales in the period and obviously the NetScaler business looks really good. I'm just wondering that just seemed higher than normal. I thought in the past you've talked about it being more like 25% to 30%. And I'm just wondering, are these guys kind of buying bigger first [ph] less frequently than they've had in the past, are you seeing any change I guess in their buying behaviour? And then the other would be -- the question on top of that would be, how do we think about the dip down sequentially off of what\u2019s a huge number in Q1 and then I just had a follow up on long term deferred. ","David Henshall","Sure. On the middle part of your question, about the sequential change from Q1 to Q2, it\u2019s just a function of -- as you said the really strong outperformance in Q1, we want to be conservative going into Q2, nothing more than that. In terms of the cloud service providers, represented about 60% of the mix in Q1. It's all of the above from your earlier question. We\u2019re continuing to build out just core infrastructure as the mega trend of cloud continues. There are new services being delivered all the time that require incremental capacity and as I mentioned a little earlier, we've been expanding that base. So trying to keep the size of the opportunity expanding at the same time. So we added a couple of hundred customers to that segment and it\u2019s really a combination of all three of those that are driving the growth. Over the past few quarters, Q4 for example, have represented about 45% of the mix. It was 60% in Q1. And so it does have the potential to be a little volatile and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re being conservative for Q2. But nothing beyond that. ","Kirill Tatarinov","I was just going to add that the base is expanding and there are more customers that\u2019s being added to the pool. ","Heather Bellini ","And then the question on long term deferred was really -- it looks like your contract duration, people are willing to pay more upfront, your long-term deferred trends over the last three quarters, have been way stronger than what kind of seasonality would suggest in the past, can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that?","David Henshall","Yes, customers are driving that actually. I mean, we're not incenting the teams to drive multi-year arrangements more so than customers are simply asking for that. It\u2019s just a function of becoming more and more strategic in their infrastructure. I can think of the largest transaction in the quarter which was with a US federal entity that included four years of underlying maintenance and that was part of the overall contract, and mapped to the outsourcing that they were doing with an additional provider. And so this is [ph] like that, that are really driving the long term deferred but overall it's just a function of -- it's critical part of their infrastructure and we are becoming more strategic and I think that trend, as it's continued over the last couple of years, should continue going forward. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci from Jefferies. ","John DiFucci ","Thank you. I had two questions. The first one is, it's being asked quite a bit here, and David, I think I asked you, might ask this question last quarter. I mean I think when you first got into this -- the business with NetScaler there was some criticism \u2013 not criticism \u2013 some concern that there was a high concentration that NetScaler sold to cloud providers. And -- but now this turns out to be -- looks to be anyway a good thing. You've typically said that this is going to be really lumpy going forward but as you just pointed out, we see nine months of pretty strong results here. And I'm just curious, if now your view on that has changed and as now -- this looks more to be a trend, versus just sort of a pretty lumpy business. ","David Henshall","Yeah, I call it slightly volatile more than lumpy. But it is still concentrated into a couple of hundreds cloud providers. We know with the top 50 being very very large household names of course. I think that it\u2019s just a reflection of the mega trend that's going on across our industry around cloud and cloud build-outs. So I wouldn't call it an insatiable appetite for capacity but it's been extreme. And so there will continue to be some quarter to quarter volatility, I think that should the expectation. But overall it's a really important segment for us and one that we expect to see solid growth in for the full year. ","John DiFucci ","And if I might as the follow up to Walter's question, because I noticed on the cash flow statement. Cash paid for licensing agreements in technology, which I'm not sure \u2013 it\u2019s usually a small number. This quarter it was $24.3 million which is I think more than two times that was all of last year. There\u2019s usually a little bit in there every quarter. And I'm just curious if that had any impact on as to why R&D was lower. And maybe you can explain that a little bit just like what is in there, especially the big jump this quarter. ","David Henshall","Not a lot of explain. I mean there's always the different things we're doing from in-bound licensing point of view, asset purchases, technology purchases and other M&A. Those are generally the four buckets of one-off items that show into R&D. Not a reflection on why OpEx was higher or lower, really an unrelated item.","John DiFucci ","Why did it jump this quarter though? What is in -- like what was special this quarter that it would jump to two times what it was less last year and it's usually pretty steady at low single digit millions? ","David Henshall","Yeah, we did a one-time licensing agreement for a technology that will become an entitlement for our customers on subscription and maintenance. ","John DiFucci ","So we shouldn\u2019t expect that going forward -- go back to sort of the low single digits of millions. I mean there might be something like that happening but generally? ","David Henshall","Yes, generally back to what it has been. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Zeller from Needham & Company.","Scott Zeller ","Another question on XenApp, there have been several. But I believe, we've heard over the past year or so of the developments and that was mentioned in the prepared remarks, the two to three years of development. And wondered if this is really a refresh cycle more than anything else. Could you add some color around that, because it seemed that, I think before the investment in the rewrite, we heard that it had not been touched for I believe five or eight years. So is this actually a refresh cycle? ","Kirill Tatarinov","I think it's a refresh cycle from two vectors, it\u2019s absolutely technology refresh cycle from Citrix point of view. There was massive engineering effort conducted over the last few years as we mentioned earlier, that resulted in this highly scalable, highly performing solutions that is built on single platform which is highly performing with patented protocol. That's one angle and that certainly drives adoption. And the other angle, there is Windows 10 phenomenon in the enterprise that essentially drives, so that reinvigoration of desire to put traditional apps legacy, as for a lack of better word, into the modern desktops, or deliver modern desktops through XenDesktop to the legacy part of it, both trends would be playing here in the future without a doubt. ","Scott Zeller ","Okay and then just a follow up, any comments about your initial thoughts you've given on fiscal \u201917, previously the 30% operating margin and 45% top line. ","David Henshall","No, we haven't updated the \u201917 numbers and we really aren\u2019t planning to until we get further in the year. Just the one comment that I made earlier, obviously we're tracking ahead of our prior guidance when it comes to operating leverage. We feel good about all the progress we're making there. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Turits from Raymond James. ","James Wesman ","Hey guys, good afternoon. It\u2019s James Wesman sitting in for Michael. First question for Kirill or David. Can you just talk about the competitive environment in desktop versus VMware this quarter and your other competitors? And I have a follow-up for David on the NetScaler. ","Kirill Tatarinov","Well, obviously competition continues and competition is very strong, and it is quite a competitive environment. As we share, we have seen some strong wins and I'm quite excited about those, and we see customers who really want to work with us, customers who love our unified story, customers who love our capabilities, there was one particular one that I would mention, that I had a chance to sit down, last Friday actually in Paris. It's a large financial institution. They\u2019ve just selected XenDesktop over VMware VDI for two main reasons. One, was overall cost of ownership and implementation, and two, was capabilities and set of scenarios that only Citrix could support and in particular, they discovered in their proof of concept that only Citrix solution could support all broad range of peripherals that they want to turn [ph] around for virtualized desktop and that drove them to us and again that is just one example of many that we're seeing but at the same time it\u2019s competitive environment we see. We see our competitors discounting their solutions heavily and in many cases it's a combat. But we're here to win. ","James Wesman ","And David, a follow up on NetScaler, I know several people have been asking this but just given that the recent success of it, and within the cloud providers and the business overall, and you've grown the top line and license double digit plus over the last nine months or so. Do you feel like this is a sustainable growth rate into 2016? Should we be thinking that this is a double-digit grower going forward? ","David Henshall","Yeah, we're obviously being conservative and cautious when we provide forward outlook. We're incredibly happy with the business over the last -- really over the last 10 years. But as you pointed out, the last nine months have been particularly strong. And so we're clearly taking share -- share is not broken out in terms of individual segments but we took several points of share last year. I think we've got the capabilities to do that going forward. If you look across our product portfolio, we\u2019ve got a unique technology approach where -- we are a software company and that gives us capabilities to deliver these types of technologies in the form factor of an appliance, in a highly virtualized appliance, in a software package or in the cloud consumption. And I think that the ability to do some really unique things with customers are going to play very very well with all the mega trends that are going on around us. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Phillip Winslow from Credit Suisse. ","Phillip Winslow ","Just going back to the XenApp and Desktop, on the Workspace suite side. And you\u2019ve talked about obviously the back end infrastructure, the upgrade that you had, but also, there was some releases where you're adding back in, call it, your front end capability as well, and then obviously with Workspace suite bundling in XenMobile capabilities. But you guys also talked about just sort of the messaging to the channel on how it was back on track beginning last year, and was building. So I guess as you sort of balance these -- all of these together, are we past the point where sort of -- there are no product issues and people are kind of ready to go in terms of upgrading the back end, and similarly where it's like, if there had been confusion in the past in the channel, are we kind of complete there too and this is sort of the run rate to expect, or is there another leg that still needs to build here in terms of the turnaround? ","Kirill Tatarinov","I think our refocusing and restructuring efforts are clearly paying off. And the feedback that we're getting from the channel, from customers and even from our own sellers have been resoundingly positive. I'd say our suite message resonates incredibly well because this is precisely what customers want to implement. Our latest releases are very strong, XenApp and Desktop, 7.8 has regions of functionality and lots of features that our competitor is simply missing at the same time. They're clearly providing this integrated environment. XenMobile 10.3, our latest release in that area is very competitive and we saw some very interesting takeouts with application management -- a mobile application management being the core strength area of ours. And that\u2019s again a case where XenMobile working together with NetScaler, working together with ShareFile provides this unique better together scenario and those are simply unmatched by competitors. So I think this is a case where we have something unique in our hands. Of course there's always more things we need to do. Of course, we continue to evolve our solution and continue to invest in continuous research and development to add those new unique scenarios and embrace the need for the new modern infrastructures and help enterprise move with the trends of digital transformation. But we feel very good with where we are and very energized about the future. ","Phillip Winslow ","And then David, a follow-up for you. In terms of just the cost savings from the realignment you've done. Obviously you talked about in the past a certain percentage actually bleeding into next year, sort of just the quarter end into 2016 here, any sort of change on that split of when these cost savings start showing up \u201916 versus \u201917?","David Henshall","I think, a lot of the short term actions are things that we executed at the end of Q4, into Q1 those are around people related items. The longer term items, the big structural things like bringing down facilities capacity and optimizing there which up to date we've touched about 27 facilities which is over 20% of the overall portfolio. Those things have long term tails on it but there are also permanent benefits. Changes to our procurement sourcing organizations, things like that will be layering in gradually over time, plus the elimination of other types of events, and programs, and projects et cetera. These things will layer in. I think the teams are running full out right now in terms of execution capacity. And as I said a couple of times, we\u2019re a little ahead of our internal plan on the timeline there. I think we'll just keep focus on that. More to do. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. ","Unidentified Analyst","It\u2019s Patrick Fong [ph] for Kirk. David, [indiscernible] was there anything from a macro competitive backdrop any different versus prior quarter or do you think this is really just about you and your channel partners just getting better?","David Henshall ","Well I think that from a macro standpoint, I mean Q1 always tends to be a little different than Q4. Most organizations are still finalizing and locking down budgets or absorbing the uplift of purchases that they incurred in Q4. And so it tends to start out a little bit slower and that's just very very typical across IT buying patterns. So I\u2019d say Q1 was as expected, US we are executing well, the teams are doing well as I pointed out a couple of times. Competition as Kirill said is very very strong in all regions. I think we've seen a high level of discounting from a lot of vendors. We've seen a high level of bundling, not just kind of a different type of discounting and that's persisted. So very competitive. Customers are very focused on the big same themes, cloud, mobility, security, et cetera, ways to simplify their own infrastructure. And so at this point I would just call it execution. ","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Ashley from Robert Baird. ","Steve Ashley ","My congrats as well. I'd like to ask about the channel. I think a lot of the discussions of ours have been on the products. But I know that making changes in channel was an important part of the recent quarter. Just like to ask you to maybe call out where you think or some of the bigger or more important things that might have changed here in the first quarter.","Kirill Tatarinov","Well, obviously the channel plays hugely important role in our future success and has been part of our go to market strategy for many years. And I think every time you have a larger vibrant channel like we have, having elements that help reinvigorated and encourage growth, something that we need to continuously do. And that's precisely what we've done and communicated in the last quarter. It's basically a program that encourages acceleration of customer adds and growth in the business, essentially rewarding our channel partners for doing more of that. ","David Henshall","And Steve, we're still working our ways through that. There's more work to do from a channel standpoint, getting the message out lighting [ph], training and certain vacations, everything else. But in terms of an early data point of the aggregate contribution from reseller -- reseller part of our channel was north of 10% Q1 to Q1, we\u2019re seeing good vibrancy in that respect and then contribution from the really large named partners was substantially higher than that. So strong quarter from an SI point of view. ","Steve Ashley ","And then another thing that you talked about on terms of go to market, was maybe doing some more targeting of the mid market and really trying to make an extended effort to reach out. Any update there, is that something that, that has begun here in the first quarter? ","David Henshall","Yeah. Early days, but that's going to be a combination of both go to market and product. And so some of the product areas that we've talked about releasing in Q1 like the browser service which gives really businesses of all size but targeted towards mid-market in many dimensions, the ability to deliver browser based stats while managing performance, security, browser compatibility et cetera in a more simplified fashion. Consumption across areas like CSP has been growing so quickly, targeted towards that smaller mid sized customer and where they can consume cloud services and not have to manage the infrastructure. I mean those are all trends moving in that direction. But in terms of the go to market efforts, we're just getting going on that front, and you should expect more through the balance of the year. ","Kirill Tatarinov","And I would add one very important elements of our strategy and execution, as it relates to ShareFile which has been a fantastic solution for mid market and essentially optimize for mid market -- and SMB essentially with its cloud based self-serve delivery model. And now as the ShareFile becomes very integral -- integrated part of the portfolio, those ingredients from the product side and those characteristics on self-service easy to deploy type methodologies is starting to resonate across Citrix and we certainly expect to see more of that happening through the rest of the portfolio which from the product side will position us much, much better in the SMB segment with a cloud delivery model. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz ","Thank you and I will add my congratulations. Getting back to the strength of the delivery networking business this quarter, you noted David that there were more than 100 new customers in this segment. Actually it sounded more like a couple of hundred. Just in answer \u2013 in your answer to Heather's question. Can you give us a sense of how those net adds compare to a typical quarter, excluding of course seasonally strong Q4? ","David Henshall","When I called that out, it was specifically in a quarter one quarter one comparison, not because there is some seasonality that goes around. Also, as compared to last quarter, so overall it\u2019s up and I think it\u2019s just a function of NetScaler becoming more visible and it\u2019s a solid solution. So not much more I'd add beyond that. ","Gregg Moskowitz ","Okay and then on the NetScaler market share, I believe what you said in the past is that you expect your NetScaler business to grow in line with or faster than the market in 2016. Based on how you've started the year from an execution standpoint, has your level of optimism increased as it relates to market share gains going forward? ","David Henshall","We're certainly happy with the performance of Q1, optimistic about our ability to execute for the balance of the year. So I'm optimistic about this business for sure. ","Kirill Tatarinov","And there are additional elements to this business that are also quite interesting, in particular in SD-WAN which is new unique capabilities that we have had in pure software delivered fashion. IDC just came out with their assessment of SD-WAN market and it\u2019s going to grow quite phenomenally and we will have opportunity to participate in it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel.","Brad Reback ","Thanks very much. David, could you give us a sense of what the core Citrix operating margin was in the quarter?","David Henshall","Brad, we haven\u2019t broken it out yet. I think the expectation should be that when we file the Form 10 which will happen later this quarter, we'll give clarity into the two operating segments. But consistent with what we've talked about in the past core Citrix is higher than what we call spin co [ph] at this point. So it operated north of the 29% margin that we posted for Q1.","Brad Reback ","And then just one quick follow up. The APJ, is that a macro issue or an execution issue?","David Henshall","That\u2019s a little of both. I mean the teams are working hard to evolve the GoTo market model there to be little bit more direct and that's more on the execution side. There's clearly macro issues and political issues that we deal with some of the larger geos over the last year plus. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.","Sanjit Singh ","Hi, this is Sanjit Singh in for Keith. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to toggle back to the workspace services division. When you talk about overall license growth being flat, I guess my question is here is \u2013how much does \u2013 to what percentage does \u2013 that we need to get to in terms of the CSP business and the workspace services business as a percentage to get that license growth, to start to accelerate to low to positive \u2013 low to mid single digit license growth? ","David Henshall","Well it's not just a function of what percentage, but that\u2019s a two variable equation. But I\u2019d say that overall we\u2019re working on growing all of them for that business. I called out a few statistics earlier. But the fact is in the aggregate we are approaching 20% coming from subscriptions, which was 14% a year ago. And that's the direction this business will continue to move over time. Plus all the work that Kirill and I have talked about around the product area just addressing some broader trends in the industry, making the products more integrated and everything that we're doing to drive on the fully baked suite approach all the tops down. So I think it's a combination of all those. Clearly we see this as a business that needs to grow, we\u2019re working really hard to make it into a sustainable growth business on the license line. ","Sanjit Singh ","And a quick follow up \u2013 with a couple quarters of really strong performance on the top line, is there anything that makes you think about accelerating the investment profile given some of the strong topline results you\u2019ve seen the past couple quarters? And also from a strategic point of view, is there anything that needs to be refined strategically, given the health of your state of the business as we look at it today? ","David Henshall","I\u2019d say strategically, I mean we're starting to talk a little bit more about that, I\u2019d invite you to come and join us at our analyst day at Synergy at the end of May, we\u2019ll be talking much more about overall Citrix strategy and how to think about that going forward. In terms of both revenue outperformance, clearly that's been driving an acceleration of our margin goals. We're fully on target for delivering that 30% plus a year, and that's not going to change. We're always investing in things that we believe are going to drive long term growth. And I think that's our responsibility to make sure we\u2019re investing in just those things that are aligned tightly to the strategy, very focused and have the highest probability returns. As we see those, we will be investing in -- the reason why we've gone through so much hard work on a restructuring is that it frees up the capital to be able to do that and deliver the upside the margins on an ongoing basis. So that's the goal. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Maguire from CLSA. ","Ed Maguire ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question about Windows 10 and its potential upgrade cycle in the enterprise, how you look at that as really an opportunity to kind of reintroduce some of your newer products and new offerings and whether you see that impacting the demand profile in your core customer base? ","Kirill Tatarinov","That's a great question. And obviously we see Windows 10 as a huge opportunity. It's a reality in the enterprise. And we see enterprise upgrades accelerating to Windows 10 and Citrix has a very important role to play in that, very important role on delivering apps to Windows 10 desktops that people and organizations just bring and upgrade by themselves but at the same time giving IT professionals and infrastructure managers the ability to deliver, manage and control Windows 10 desktops too, so they have more control regulated environment. And I think both of that -- both of those are very important trends and our customers are telling us that this is really -- I would say a very significant beginning of this upgrade cycle that we certainly look forward to participating. ","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Zane Crane [ph] for Mark. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. I was just wondering if you could give an update on some of the retention rates across Workspace services and NetScaler, especially with Windows 10 coming out? Any potential positive impacts on retention rates in Workspace? Thank you. ","David Henshall","Sure if you're referring to subscription and maintenance retention rates, they've been basically unchanged. We went in the mid to high 80s, continued to do that in Q1. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Pavlove [ph] sitting in for Abhey. Thanks for taking the question. On the capital allocation front, what are your thoughts on paying a dividend? Is it something that's on the table post spin-off? ","David Henshall","Well we haven't discussed it publicly, of course but I think right now that the message that we've talked about on the last couple of quarters is capital strategy is something that we will be addressing in the post spin and the rest of it with no clarity in terms of how we're thinking about the balance sheet, how we're thinking about capital use going forward et cetera. So I'd say let\u2019s just hang tight until we get through the spin and we can have a more focused conversation on capital structure. ","Operator","And our next question comes from John Rizzuto from SunTrust.","John Rizzuto ","Yes, hi. Just a point of clarification David or Kirill, when you were talking earlier about XenDesktop, or XenDesktop as it's used at John Hopkins I believe as an example, something driving XenApp sales, that unified infrastructure. I was under the impression that if you are getting XenDesktop, you are still getting XenApp as part of that XenApp virtualization. I'm wondering how you -- is that true? And well, is that true? ","Kirill Tatarinov","But if you're getting a suite you\u2019re getting both. If you\u2019ve got a standalone product, and now you want to expand, you would want to expand either by adding another product or expanding into a suite, and that\u2019s the best dynamic that we're seeing and \u2013 it\u2019s very easy to do now because the two are on the same infrastructure. And that expansion becomes natural for customers unlike \u2013 ","John Rizzuto ","So XenDesktop does not come with application virtualization then, correct? Is that what you are saying, because that is what I am asking? ","David Henshall","John, the underlined examples that we talked about was where our customer is using VDI solutions from a different vendor and still using XenApp to deliver application. ","John Rizzuto ","Oh, it wasn't your VDI solution? Okay, got you.","David Henshall","Correct and this is about unifying the two together. ","John Rizzuto ","Okay. Because, I guess, what I was after is, if you have -- if there's a lot of XenDesktop out there historically, is there a potential for XenApp upsell, and is that one of the things that might be driving the adoption there or that wouldn't make sense, because the XenDesktop does comes with the XenApp inclusion? ","David Henshall","John, there's an upsell opportunity to Workspace suite \u2013 for existing XenApp customers. But more broadly it's just about expanding the applicability of the solution to drive greater penetration.","John Rizzuto ","Okay. And then, in that being said, when did the new -- because for a while there, you didn't have the SKU for XenApp, and then you reintroduced the SKU, is that correct? ","David Henshall","We reintroduced the product over a year ago. When -- effectively end of life of the product when we reintroduced at that point in time. We've been just moving it forward since then. ","End of Q&A","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time and I will now turn the call back over to management for closing comments. ","Kirill Tatarinov","Well, thank you very much for joining us today and thank you for calling Citrix as we move our business forward. After almost 90 days with the company holding many discussions with our customers, analysts and many of you actually, I'm convinced that Citrix today has the right focus and exciting product roadmap and the right strategy for the future. I look forward to seeing many of you at the end of May for our analyst day where we will be sharing details of our strategy of growing the business further. Thank you all very much. Have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites","Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call, where we will be discussing Citrix's first quarter 2012 financial results.","Participating in the call will be Mark Templeton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Henshall, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast with a slide presentation on the Citrix Systems Investor Relations website. And the slide presentation associated with the webcast will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin the review of our financial results, I want to state that we have posted product classification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to the Investor Relations page of our website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as the impact of the global economic climate, uncertainty in the IT spending environment, risks associated with our products, acquisitions and competition.

A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now I would like to turn it over to David Henshall, our Chief Financial Officer. David?","David James Henshall","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As you see from the release, we continue to have great momentum across the business, delivering total revenue up 20% from last year; adjusted EPS of $0.59 a share; deferred revenue up $23 million, sequentially; and $243 million in cash flow from ops, an increase of 53%.","We're driving market leadership across Desktop Virtualization, delivering powerful new technologies in cloud networking and expanding the breadth of our SaaS products. All trends that can be clearly seen in the results. ","From a geographic perspective, the Americas region had a revenue growth of 16% from last year, up $252 million. The results within the geo were fairly balanced, with strength coming from both Desktop and NetScaler products. The Americas had 18 individual transactions over $1 million each compared to 11 a year ago, really reflecting the more strategic engagement that we've built with customers. On a vertical basis, only the U.S. federal phase was somewhat uneven.","In EMEA, revenue was up 20% to $160 million. Performance was strong across the region in a number of different geos especially with big deals. The team closed 7 orders over $1 million each a number of multi-year commitments, including a few very large deals in the government and financial services sector.","And finally, Japan and APAC remain our fastest growing markets, combining for 40% total revenue growth and 48% growth in new product license. These regions are executing really well, and will continue to outpace the rest of the business throughout the year.","So next, let's look at our Q1 results within our primary markets. First, our Desktop Solutions business grew 17% over $338 million including license growth, that was also at 17%. For some context on this business, there's a few metrics that I think really help demonstrate the market adoption we're seeing and the value that customers are placing on Desktop Virtualization within their infrastructure. ","In Q1, there were 19 different $1-plus million deals for the Desktop products, representing customers in technology, telecom, government, financial services and other verticals. We transacted with over 3,000 different customers, including 110 deals for more than 1,000 seats of Desktop and 26 deals of more than 5,000 seats, which is an increase of over 50% year-over-year.","New licenses contributed over 90% of the product mix, with the remaining 10% coming from existing customers trading up from XenApp. And while still a modest number in total revenue, we now have over 1,600 cloud service providers delivering several hundred thousand Desktop licenses as a subscription service to their own customers.","So Desktop Virtualization is playing an increasingly prominent role in enterprise IT and serving as an enabling technology to accelerate business imperatives. For example, in Q1, a leading provider of health care IT, a 50,000 XD licenses to further support their hosted services practice, allowing health care providers to concentrate on patient care instead of worrying about IT. Or a large telecom equipment manufacturer with over 100,000 employees worldwide using XenDesktop and NetScaler appliances as a solution to enhance data security at the Desktop. Or a government agency, which purchased 4,000 XD licenses plus some NetScalers to build a computing solution that provides access to multiple isolated secure networks from a singleton client, lowering costs and enhancing security, all while improving productivity. We're increasingly engaging with customers at this level as the conversation has moved from technology to business enablement.","And over the past year, we've focused on reducing the cost of Desktop Virtualization as really a driver for wide-scale adoption, and demonstrate innovation that drop the capital cost of XenDesktop below that of physical desktops in many cases. We're also innovating rapidly around performance, management and simplicity to further extend our differentiation in the market. ","Next, in our Data Center and Cloud business, total revenue was up more than 28% to $100 million with products revenue increasing 22%. Book was again led by NetScaler, where products revenue was up 46% year-on-year, offsetting declines in both the standalone SSL VPN and WAN optimization solutions, both of which are increasingly being sold as add-on modules on top of NetScaler.","Our networking success is coming from a number of different areas. First, we continue to see traction driving across all motion into our enterprise account base with over 400 Desktop deals, including NetScaler as part of the solution.","Second, new high-end SDX platform is gaining momentum with service providers and large enterprises, 20% sequentially, and now representing more than 10% of total NetScaler license. ","Third, we're seeing strong new customer growth in both the appliance and VPX versions of our products, adding more than 600 net new accounts in Q1. ","And finally, from dot com accounts, that are building of infrastructure to support large cloud-based service offerings.","So overall, the Data Center and Cloud business had a good start to 2012. Our networking solutions are growing faster than the underlying market. And we're very excited about the recent announcement of NetScaler 10, a platform that brings a new level of performance and cost savings to both enterprise and carrier networks.","Within our Software as a Service business, revenue was up 21% from last year. The collaboration products, which account for over half of our total SaaS revenue, increased 29%. In general, we saw steady gains in new customer acquisition from both of the direct and online channels as well as modestly higher retention rates within the subscriber base. Geographically, the investments we've been making to expand internationally are showing good results, with revenue from these markets up 50% and now accounting for about 15% of the total mix. ","We also continue to have a focus on mobile collaboration and on powering mobile work styles. So in Q1, we released HDFaces videoconferencing for GoToMeeting on the iPad. We began integrating ShareFile, our data sharing solution, into the enterprise sales motion. We announced the acquisition of Podio, a social team collaboration platform. And Mark will discuss each of these in greater detail.","So turning to expenses and operations. In Q1, adjusted op margin was 23.5%. This is ahead of our guidance due to the strong revenue performance and the timing of certain investments especially hiring, which ramped lower than we originally anticipated. In total, during Q1, we added about 140 people to Citrix, which brings total headcount to over 7,000. We do expect that the pace of hiring will increase in Q2 and remain focused on our expanding our go-to-market capacity and customer touch through enterprise account managers, consulting and greater tech-support capacity; but also, of course, on product innovation, to bring the market new technologies, as well as improving integration across solutions to drive simplicity, differentiation and customer experience; areas that help accelerate adoption.","The last item I want to mention is cost of goods sold. As forecasted, we've seen a slow but steady increase in COGS as a percent of revenue. And the main reason here has been the mix of revenue as we drive higher contribution from consulting services, SaaS and networking. ","Additionally, we also adjusted our internal methodology for allocating certain IT costs from OpEx up to COGS to really just more closely align with employees that are actually consuming these services. So looking forward, we expect that adjusted gross margin will be in the range of 88% to 88.5% for the balance of the year.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased to $1.6 billion, driven in large part by record cash flow from operations. As I mentioned earlier, cash flow in the quarter was $243 million, bringing the trailing 12-month total to over $762 million, an increase of 21%. ","The other item of note on the balance sheet is deferred revenue. Our deferred balance at the end of Q1 was $983 million, up 25% from a year ago. The $23 million sequential increase reflects the evolution in customer engagement that we've had, we've really talked about over the past few quarters, as several initiated multi-year commitments, either for term-based licenses or multiyear subscription agreements.","So overall, looking at the business, very strong Q1. We're executing well. We're seeing growth in all our primary markets, and we're making the investments necessary to expand our leadership position.","So finally, I'd like to talk about our current outlook and expectations for 2012. The activity metrics and pipeline continue to be strong. We've remained focused on delivering financial results, while investing to expand long-term capacity across our main businesses plus the new markets we entered over the past 3 quarters. While we do expect to see some volatility in the spending environment, specifically within the U.S. Fed and EMEA, we're comfortable raising our 2012 outlook based on the strength of Q1 and the continuing momentum we see across the company. ","Also, consistent with our guidance over the past 2 quarters, we're currently planning to run the business with an adjusted operating margin percent that is flat to 2011, which really gives us the capacity to invest across 3 main areas: Go-to-market, to increase our market position and revenue growth around the world; innovation, to extend differentiation; and of course, to ramp the new acquisitions we made last year. As we said on the January call, these acquisitions will be dilutive to consolidated earnings for the first half of the year as we build our capacity and then accretive by Q4.","So the full year 2012, our current expectations have increased to total revenue in the range of $2.53 billion to $2.56 billion, and adjusted EPS between $2.75 to $2.79 per share. And for the second quarter of 2012, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $605 million to $615 million, and adjusted EPS between $0.58 and $0.59 a share. ","So now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks a lot, David. 2012 is clearly off to a strong start. I'm really delighted with our Q1 results, building on the momentum we gained throughout 2011. I'd like to thank the entire Citrix team for great execution across strategy, innovation and operations. I'm especially pleased with the continued growth of XenDesktop that David discussed. From here, we're taking Desktop Virtualization to a new level with our upcoming Synergy announcements and in partnership with Microsoft, as they introduce new versions of Windows Server, System Center and Azure, along with Windows 8 desktops and tablets. ","In addition to Desktop Virtualization, we're making great strides in Web collaboration and cloud networking, where our products are #1 or #2 in the world. Last year, 7 strategic acquisitions strengthened those positions and opened adjacent growth opportunities for data sharing and cloud platforms. These new euro markets are growing at double-digit rates, estimate as a top $16 billion by 2015, fueled by 3 powerful continuous forces: The imperative for mobility; the enterprise cloud evolution; and the build-out of hosted cloud services.","Next, I'd like to briefly highlight a few of the new things we're doing to leverage these forces for growth. First, is ShareFile. We've just completed our first full quarter in the cloud data sharing market with ShareFile, executing incredibly well, bringing this team on board and growing it. ShareFile enables secure cloud-based document sharing across all your devices, securing information while enabling complete mobility. ShareFile growth hasn't missed a beat and in fact, has accelerated, competing and winning on security, simplicity and service in key vertical and departmental markets. ","We're also seeing healthy interest from our enterprise customer base for the Citrix brand and smooth integration with XenDesktop gives us a strong advantage and is driving a dramatic increase in pipeline of 6- and 7-figured ShareFile deals. This market is highly fragmented from start-ups to industry giants. Our focus on the business user for the Follow-Me-Data vision is resonating. And we're finding that our trusted brand differentiates us from start-up players, while the maturity of our product sets us apart from larger, late entrants. We think of all of this as iCloud for business, because it's a platform where people, devices and apps securely and seamlessly share data.","As David mentioned, we're seeing excellent growth share gains from the Web Collaboration market, especially after the addition of HDFaces videoconferencing with GoToMeeting. As a natural extension to GoToMeeting style collaboration, we recently announced the acquisition of Podio, a cloud-based team collaboration platform with all the power of social. Podio brings together all the tools and content that teams need for the new cloud euro work styles, where mobility is paramount, where teams extend beyond the firewall and where simpler is better. ","Podio integrates with many popular cloud-based data storage, collaboration and content tools, including Dropbox, Google Apps, Google Docs to name a few. As you might guess, we'll have a few new ones to add to that list at Synergy.","A truly unique feature is the built-in Podio app market, filled with hundreds of free apps that simplify project workflows for all the most common business processes. Users can even customize or build their own workflow apps. No training, coding or pocket protectors required. The way I like to think about Podio is team project collaboration for the Facebook generation, social, organic and connected. It's not just a place you talk about work, it's a place where work gets done. ","I'm really thrilled about the powerful combination of GoToMeeting, ShareFile and Podio and what the move to mobile is all about. The move to cloud services is just as profound when it comes to market and growth potential. We have great momentum with Citrix CloudStack, with over 100 customers in production cloud deployments, running commercial clouds that are generating well over $1 billion in revenue today for some of the bigger brands in the world including Korea Telecom, GoDaddy, Zynga and many others. No other cloud platform in the industry even comes close.","CloudStack adoption is a part of a massive build-out of Cloud Infrastructure taking place today, a build-out led by open-sourced technologies that are first proven at scale by the likes of Zynga, Facebook and Google, then made broadly available under an open-source license. ","Now that CloudStack has been proven at scale in some of the world\u2019s fastest and growing clouds, we're taking a page from that Playbook by moving it into the Apache Software Foundation, home of the world's most successful, open-sourced projects like Apache Web Server, Tomcat, Hadoop, Cassandra and Hive. We believe this move will add significant energy to CloudStack's momentum, accelerating the development of OpenClouds and helping customers steer clear of proprietary lock-in approaches. We will, of course, be active contributors to Apache CloudStack along with other great developers. And we'll deliver a commercially supported release of the technology as the centerpiece of our Cloud Infrastructure portfolio, complemented by XenServer, CloudPortal and NetScaler. ","At Synergy, you'll hear more a lot more about how all this comes together in a very powerful way to drive thousands of anything as a service clouds.","The cloud network is at the delivery core of scalable cloud services, providing amazing growth of Citrix NetScaler. NetScaler already delivers the majority of the world's largest Internet sites and is best positioned to benefit from the cloud build-out. ","Last week, we launched NetScaler 10, a landmark release that brings the power of cloud networking to customers of any size. It includes groundbreaking price-scale technology, making it really easy to scale delivery networks up and out. Scale up as you grow without buying new hardware. Scale in by consolidating multiple networking functions into a single appliance. And scale out to extend capacity at a far lower cost by adding new NetScalers in simple Amazon-style clusters.","NetScaler's new TriScale technology leapfrogs the competition by scaling up to a stunning 1.4 terabytes in a single cluster. That's more than 8 times the capacity of our largest competitor. We'll be talking a lot more about NetScaler 10 and a lot more about everything Citrix at Synergy 2012 in 2 weeks. And I'd like to personally invite you to come. It's the premier event on the convergence of cloud virtualization, mobility and networking, taking center stage at San Francisco's Moscone on May 9 to 11. As always, we'll be introducing the future with some excellent announcements, breakthrough technologies and new partnerships, along, of course, with a few surprises. You can register at citrixsynergy.com. It's definitely going to be another sell-out event. I hope you'll join us.","In closing, we're executing well, seeing growth in all our primary businesses and making the investments necessary to deliver shareholder, customer and employee value. We're driving unprecedented improvements in the way people use computing, the way services are delivered and how it all works behind the scenes. I believe we're well prepared for the road ahead where mobility, connectedness and cloud services are as fundamental as the air we breathe.","And now, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You mentioned that you've been able to take down the costs associated with Desktop Virtualization deployment. I was wondering if you could share with us kind of how steep, how fast do you see that cost curve going down from here? If there's anything you can share with us about how much cheaper you think the solutions can get from people to help spur adoption.","Mark B. Templeton","Heather, this is Mark. In the Synergy in Barcelona, we put out some technologies and a roadmap along with partnerships, where we predicted that by Synergy San Francisco, we'd see the marginal cost of a Desktop in a VDI-type model, an overall Desktop Virtualization infrastructure would actually be less than the marginal cost of a physical Desktop. And we still believe that to be true. And that'll come from the combination of cost reductions, the end point cost reductions, obviously in the form of greater densities at the server, and cost reductions in terms of storage in the back end. And I think we'll be able to demonstrate that in a couple of weeks at the conference.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess I was just wondering as a follow-up to that is just how -- are you just starting to see that curve where you can really start to see a benefit if you look out a few years down the road, where you could really get an infection and kind of make it a no-brainer for this transition to occur.","Mark B. Templeton","I think cost is one of the things, but just one of the things that needs to happen around the sort of no-brainerness. And I think we're doing a number of things related to getting there, including making the migration of legacy apps much, much easier. Certainly, we saw some great uptick in interest in AppDNA and that acquisition from Q4. There's another set of obstacles around overall strategies for Desktop transformation. And we're investing heavily in services, support and consulting, et cetera to do that. So I think there are a number of things that happened to drive greater velocity of adoption, not just the cost of -- the marginal cost of the Desktop. And I think we\u2019re working across all those fronts, and we'll continue to see, I think, acceleration in the momentum in the overall DV space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Holt from Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question is about NetScaler, which continues to grow meaningfully ahead of consensus expectations. And David, you laid out 4 drivers that seemed to me they'd be drivers that will persist for the next several quarters. Can you talk a little bit about outlook there, and specifically your expectations around been able to maintain above-market growth?","David James Henshall","Sure, Adam. I think in general, all the things I highlighted have been trends that we've talked about the past couple of quarters and they feel like they're really continuing to deepen. And we've been very excited about everything, from our increase in go-to-market capacity, we've talked a lot about just improving execution, cross sell, et cetera. We're also increasing total capacity. I mean, we have seen good uptake in markets outside the U.S. that had frankly been a little slower to adopt some of the networking technologies. So I think we've got a number of growth engines beyond just the ones that I talked about. As far as the outlook for the business, I think, certainly in the short term, we've got the capability and believe that we can outgrow the market over the next few quarters. And as we guide to the overall numbers, I mean, we'll be looking at the total Data Center and Cloud business in the aggregate of course. And that's the way we talk about it. That should still be in north of 20% range in 2012.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on the model. You had another quarter, where billings outpaced revenue and cash flow meaningfully outpaced operating income. As the model transitions as you suggested, do you expect that to continue, that relationship between billings and revenue and cash flow and operating income?","David James Henshall","Yes, I do. I think that definitely, deferred revenue will grow this year. You should expect that bookings will outpace revenue. And from a cash flow standpoint, we had a great cash flow quarter, as you mentioned. I think trailing '12 cash flow is up more than 21%, which yields over $4 per share of cash flow. We're driving that actively right now and it's something that we're very focused on. So I'd love to exit the year with cash flow from operations at a goal north of $800 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","It feels like Europe seems to be doing better for you than it has for a number of other folks. Any changes you've made in Europe -- obviously, you hired a new head of Europe. But are there any other changes that are that are going on in the region, Or anything you're seeing that, that's different than what everyone else is seeing?","David James Henshall","Yes, Bhavan, as you know, we've been pretty cautious on EMEA for some time, and there's, obviously, a lot of macro-driven business confidence issues. And in my remarks, I pointed out that the expectations should be for a little lumpiness there, just driven by those effective factors. But I will say that we've been just maniacally focused on the things that we can control. That is around execution, building pipeline, focusing on customers and large deals. And I think you saw that in Q1. We had a number of big deals. The total big deal contribution from EMEA was up more than double from what it was a year ago. So that's really showing how we're executing on a strategic level. But it's still a little bit uneven on the kind of low- mid-end business, which is more economically sensitive, more related to hiring and things like that. So again, we'll focus on what we can control. We feel good about the execution. The teams are driving good performance, but it's safe to expect a little bit of lumpiness there throughout the year.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then turning to the SI channel, obviously, that's been an important driver in the past. Any color on that this quarter and sort of a percentage of XenDesktop deals were driven by SIs?","David James Henshall","Yes, SIs actually performed really well in Q1. As you expect, most of the large deals tend to be associated with SIs at some level. So we had great contribution from Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Fujitsu, just to name the 3 big ones. I'd say, as far as percent of bookings, it's certainly the highest it's been in some time. The actual contribution in dollar terms was up more than 100% year-on-year. But again, that's one of those that does tend to be fairly lumpy, simply because it's associated with big deals. So it will bounce around quarter-to-quarter, but the trend is absolutely up and to the right. And in the aggregate, I think we've trained close to probably 10,000 people now across all of the SIs. So it's a constant process we're working at each and every quarter, but it's certainly moving in the right direction.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then one last one for Mark on ShareFile. It's interesting that you're seeing enterprise interest in ShareFile and enterprise sales forces outselling Online Services for the first time. Two things, I guess: one, just sort of any color on sort of what the enterprise is looking to do. And are they comfortable with the cloud for this offering? Or is there a plan to do -- I mean it's a licensed offering here. And then two, competition space with Google's Drive and Microsoft SkyDrive seems to be heating up as a way of sharing and collaborating. Just sort of a sense of how they sort of fit in, in the space and how you play with them.","Mark B. Templeton","Well, just overall, the success we're seeing on the enterprise side is really evidence of the adjacency of doc and data sharing to apps and desktops. So it's very natural part of the conversation when you're talking about virtualizing desktops and apps. So there's great comfort in the sales organization in doing that, and customers have the interest. That interest, obviously, is heavily stimulated by the explosion of devices, a need to go mobile with documents but yet secure. And at the same time, on the other side, great concern around governance, control, et cetera and sort of the evidence of Dropbox into the enterprise. And this actually gives them the kind of control point that they're looking for to feel comfortable about mobility and sharing, but governance and compliance and control. The interest around cloud will wane. So there are some customers that just say, \"Look, I can't put documents in the cloud and that's just the way it is right now, because of my own comfort and regulatory issues.\" We are working closely with them to imagine solutions to that problem. And so what we're focused are the customers that really have the cloud mentality and comfort. And that seems to be a very rich opportunity in our install base of customers. And as far as competition goes, it's a huge market. It's early stage. As I mentioned, it's fragmented. And when we look at what's happening, Google, Microsoft, the Apple with iCloud, Dropbox, et cetera, it's more and more clear that there's a universe around personal and consumer that has massive opportunity and upside for those huge brands. And at the same time, on the other side, is there's a market for those that focus on teams and business, which is really our focus along with other types of players. And obviously, our strategy is to make ShareFile and document sharing part of the whole mobile work style solution that includes Podio, GoToMeeting, all of the pool we can get with virtual desktops and apps and bring all that together, and that will be our differentiated approach to the marketplace, and we think it's got a lot of legs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore Partners.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess just 2 really quick ones. First, just we've talked a lot about bigger Desktop deals. I'm just kind of curious how some of the demand at those are mid-tier levels coming, now that you had VDI-in-a-Box out for 3 or 6 months? And then second, Mark, I was just curious if you could just offer some comments around the decision to sort of go with CloudStack on your own and pull out the OpenStack and some of the thought process around that.","David James Henshall","Kirk, this is David. Let me take the first part of the question. As far as the breadth of adoption we're seeing on Desktop, I'd point you back to the some of the metrics that I called out in my script. We've got just so many hundreds of customers now in that 1,000-seat-plus range, and a very large number in 5,000 or 10,000. So those are covering customers across pretty much every vertical and every size. So really, it's the same basic issues being addressed, mobility, security, management, better agility in their own infrastructure, things that will accelerate their own business initiatives. As far as the new products like VDI-in-a-Box, that's -- we're really just starting to ship that right now. We got our teams trained up in the January time frame. We've got a new agreement with Dell that we announced fairly recently. And I think that's going to start shipping shortly. So probably in the next 6 months, we'll have much better actual data to talk about in terms of performance there.","Mark B. Templeton","As far as the CloudStack decision, Kirk, basically, if you sort of look at this objectively, OpenStack community, which we were part of founding, a lot of visibility and a lot of big brands involved. But on the technology side, immaturity, and a slow trajectory towards maturing as a platform that you can actually really run high-capacity, high-performance Cloud Infrastructure and CloudStack now has to that uniquely. And we're -- as I mentioned in the prepared comments, that we're hovering over 100 in-production clouds from general purpose kind of infrastructure and service clouds to more special purpose types of gaming clouds. And the issue there is the demand in the marketplace is around design wins and it's now. And so we felt like we needed to do everything we could do to accelerate CloudStack. And to do that, we decided to join the Apache Software Foundation, where we think we'll get a lot of acceleration, a much larger developer community, one that has a track record of really producing some pretty outstanding open-source projects -- as I mentioned Hadoop and TomCat and Web server and so forth. And so it's really that simple, and that will help us, a, package a commercial product that will certify support, et cetera and support the kinds of customers we're already supporting; and b, allow us to then complement that with CloudPortal, with NetScaler, with XenServer, with some of our other products, so that our customers and those that build clouds on CloudStack can actually win in the marketplace. And what that means is acquire profitable customers and grow. And that's what we're -- that's our focus is to help customers like KT and IDC Frontier and GoDaddy, Zynga and many, many others achieve their goals. And that is growth and profitable growth through the differentiation in providing cloud services, so it's pretty straightforward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just have a question about concurrency ratios. I know you guys have kind of talked about this in the past, hovering around 3-ish. But with the proliferation of connected devices, high-speed broadband, et cetera, and people using XenApps and XenDesktop to send apps in Desktops out to more and more devices and, basically, people logging in more. What are you seeing in terms of concurrency ratios to your customers? So in other words, how should we be think about sort of the base of users growing of Citrix applications versus call off [ph] the penetration or the paid-for level inside that?","David James Henshall","Yes, Kirk (sic) [Phil], this is David. I'll take the first crack at it. I think concurrency is really not a metric that we track that closely anymore, and that's because the nature of usage has changed a lot over the years. I mean if you look back when concurrency really mattered 4 or 5 or 6 years ago, it was because people were using app virtualization on much more of a tactical or project basis and that implied intermittent usage. If you look at where we are today and how customers are thinking about virtualization of the Desktop, it tends to be much a part of infrastructure. And that can be either delivering a large set of applications across the organization or it could be simply replacing a physical Desktop with the virtual Desktop. Or in many cases, it's the -- in addition to story, which includes enabling mobile devices for people that still maintain their physical. And for us, the long-term growth strategy is just about the seeds [ph]. So we're driving licenses across users, across devices and in some cases, across concurrency. But it's certainly less relevant than it has been in the past.","Mark B. Templeton","Kirk (sic) [Phil], the only thing that I would add is that the way we look at concurrency, is it's a licensing model that customers can choose based upon what lines up with their strategic and\/or tactical goals. And there are certain types of customers like call centers, like health care providers, et cetera where concurrency is actually a very strategic licensing model that enables their business model, so we see it more that way than kind of a scorecard on penetration these days.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives of FBR.","Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","In terms of the NetScaler 10, just talk about where the -- how you sort of thinking about that product release and just the ramp throughout the second half of the year, what you think that could do to the NetScaler base?","Mark B. Templeton","I'll sort of take the first piece of that and maybe David can add some color around sort of ramp. But NetScaler 10 is, as I mentioned, it's really a huge milestone release of the NetScaler software. And this price scale technology is, we think quite profound, because what we have now is really a product that can go from a very small virtual instance where you're pushing megabits of capacity all the way through and breakthrough of the 1.4 terabyte capacity, which is unprecedented in the marketplace. I think we're first to actually break the 1 terabyte throughput limit. And so this gives us access, angle to every kind of market that's out there from a full range of service providers in their core infrastructure and as part of the service that they offer and enterprises from medium to the world's largest and the full range of dot coms and ecoms that we have serviced so well for so long, because they're looking for more scalable, simpler and easier managed environments. So I think it just gives us a lot more market reach, further differentiates us and gives us a platform for some new innovations coming that we're really, really excited about that we'll hear more about later this year.","David James Henshall","Yes, I would just add that in terms of the actual ramp rate, it's going to be all predicated on what customers have in place in their infrastructure in existing accounts, and then obviously opening up new accounts. And probably a pretty good proxy is looking at FDX, which we've been in the market now 3 full quarters. We're seeing, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, actual sequential increase of over 20% from Q4 to Q1, representing between 10% to 15% of the mix in just that short period of time. So we're shipping thousands and thousands of boxes each quarter, so we've got a pretty big base out there. And give us a couple of quarters of actuals and we'll come back and kind of give you a little bit more granularity on the mix.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Wanted to follow up, Mark, on CloudStack being offered up to Apache. And you spoke about the industry momentum that you expect as a result of this move. When should we look for a commercially supported release, specifically on Apache? And when do you think that this could really start contributing to your financials?","Mark B. Templeton","Gregg, I'd rather reserve the answer to that for Synergy, because we don't want to sort of get into that here. That will be a significant part of the conference conversation. But we really feel good about the momentum we've built. And then it's a process to actually incubate a new project in Apache Software Foundation. And we're working that hard and we'll have more news about that in a couple of weeks, so I'd rather kind of answer your question then.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","That's fine, Mark, look forward to that in 2 weeks. On another note, I've been picking up some really positive buzz around Cisco and their VXI initiative. And I know it's early days, but wanted just to kind of hear, even anecdotally, how the Cisco reselling relationship is going around that.","Mark B. Templeton","Okay. It's actually going quite well. I mean I think we've continued to see the ramp up in the relationship with Cisco on VXI, XenDesktop and actually extending beyond that to be one of the fastest ramp partnerships that we've ever seen. The last one that ramped this fast was our partnership with NetApp, once we got into this core virtualization market. So we're really delighted to see that. I think you will see a lot more energy going toward that coming from Cisco in terms of visibility, et cetera later this year. And we're delighted to be working with them at the front lines on some pretty significant deals.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'd just like to start with a competitive question around VMware and its ELAs. In the accounts in which VMware has ELAs with Desktop virtualization, is that a place where you have historically done business and maybe more importantly, looking forward -- do you view that as a place you could do business in the future? Or are those just kind of roped off and really not open for you guys to penetrate?.","David James Henshall","Sure, Steve. It's David. I'd say the answer is absolutely, we do business in accounts that have ELAs in place. And most large enterprise have some level of server virtualization already out there. When you look at some of our statistics around XenDesktop being deployed across, whether it's Xen or ESX or Hyper-V or others, a large part of the strategy is just making sure that we are agnostic to that underlying level and we give customers that ability to choose, so that they don't feel like they're locked in to a specific platform and give them the most powerful, best-performing solution for what they're really trying to accomplish. The flip side of that, of course, is when you're selling into a large bundled transaction that is driven by account control or bundled pricing or something, that's probably a little bit more challenging. But overall, we are extremely happy with the win rates that we see across the board for XenDesktop. They really haven't changed over the last couple of quarters. I know we've talked about those in the past and it continues to be a very competitive market. And I think that's actually really good for a long-term growth of the entire industry.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then a question on XenApp license. I know you're not going to give us specific numbers, but I was wondering if you might be able to qualitatively tell us some color on whether it was up or down year-over-year in the period?","David James Henshall","Steve, I'm actually not going to give you the details, simply because it's not -- it doesn't really matter to us. And I don't want to keep encouraging people to dig into the individual components so much. But overall, the thing to look at is just the combined license, which was up 17% coming off of a number of quarters last year, they were also in the high teens. The majority of the growth in deferred revenue is related to Desktop. And so, all the metrics continue to be very positive on that front.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I noticed that it's a little hard to compare versus a year early because you've restated some of your numbers. But it looks like you've outperformed on the license update, so I'm just wondering what drove that? And how sustainable might that, what looks to be, catch-up maintenance growth rate?","David James Henshall","Sure, Kash. You're right. The underlying component around license update did accelerate into the mid-teens, and it was certainly slower than that last year. Throughout all last year, we talked about the lag effect that Subscription Advantage has from new license sales. And as we have been able to accelerate licenses over the last, let's say, 8 quarters or so, you're starting to see that catch up now in subscriptions. And so that's been a nice positive driver. But to reiterate why we've combined both of those is, frankly, to align with how we're going to market. We've taken a much more focused, call it, lifetime approach or lifetime value approach to the customer. And we're now offering holistic software maintenance and hardware maintenance that will include what used to be Subscription Advantage, just upgrading licenses, as well as comprehensive tech support solutions. So over the long term, this allows us to stay much closer to customers and should actually help drive this line as we see higher and higher adoption of those solutions.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. David, also there was a nice out performance on the deferred revenue side up 22% -- $23 million sequentially. It looks like a lot of that debt was driven by XenDesktop. When this comes to revenue recognition, will it show up as update or licenses?","David James Henshall","Sure, Kash. Yes, just on deferred revenue, I mean we didn't talk too much about this in the prepared remarks. But look at the delta between the short term and long term, and that's really representative of the overall trends that we see from a customer engagement standpoint. In fact, long-term deferreds are up 45% year-on-year. And that's a continuation of a lot of customers looking to buy either long-term term-based licenses, which we have a few and those get recognized back through license. Or in many cases, multiple years of maintenance or subscription. And those will come back through the license update maintenance line. So there's not a percent breakout that I would give at this point in time. It just really depends quarter-to-quarter on how those deals are structured.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mark, I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about what effect the happenings at Microsoft are having on your business? We note that you've got the Windows XP end of life in the spring of 2014. And so that's one question. And related to that, we saw recently that Microsoft had -- to date is planning on adding an additional license called the companion device licensing for using Desktops on non-Windows tablets. And I'm wondering, just overall, how you're thinking about the impact of Microsoft on this Desktop Virtualization business at this point in time?","Mark B. Templeton","Sure, Walter. So first, the expiration of Windows XP is driving a lot of consideration around how to deliver the next-generation Desktop, whether it's Windows 7 or Windows 8, whether it's kind of a legacy or legacy-oriented from a design point of view, Windows 32, apps or even browser apps that are really built to take advantage of IE. So all of that is actually good push and the clock is counting down, and I think positive overall for the classic business that we've had around apps and Desktop and actually helps the AppDNA kind of acquisition that we've made in Q4. More prospectively in looking forward, what Microsoft is doing in server and at the client in the cloud and in the systems management area, we're plugging into all of that as part of the new platform that's built around the Windows 8 architecture and model. So we think actually that we'll continue to leverage all of that as we always have, and take advantage of something that's new, and that is Microsoft is really much more involved and supportive of the notion of virtual desktops and apps, which will grow the primary market in a way that it hasn't before. And obviously, with the right value ads, strategies and partnering, we'll be able to grow right along with that. We're pretty excited about it and will talk more about that at Synergy. As far as the CDL license, this is just new, kind of just getting out there. I think there are a few interpretations of it out on the Internet. And I'd rather not interpret it here for you until we actually understand it better. Certainly, Microsoft is thinking hard about how to bring virtual desktops, virtual apps into more of a mainstream and primary market and do that in a way that complies with licensing in their business model and so forth, which we have always been fully supportive of. And we've been kind of through multiple cycles and gen eras of licensing around virtual desktops and apps with Microsoft. And it usually results -- the way it usually happens is everyone's negative on the front end and then everyone figures out kind of how to leverage it in the end and make it a positive. And my guess is this will be a similar sort of thing.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then David, just on the online or I guess you're calling this software as a Service business now, those growth rates have accelerated over the last 5 quarters here, I think after seeing some slow down. And you've also done some M&A there. So I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, is this 20% growth rate based on the mix of that business now with collaboration more -- Is that more of a sustainable growth rate? Or are we simply seeing some M&A benefits here that may subside as we get into the coming quarters?","David James Henshall","Yes, I think we've got a number of sustainable businesses in there and the big drivers are going to be -- certainly the collaboration business, which we talk a lot about, GoToMeeting, GoToTraining, GoToWebinar, et cetera, being the biggest component there. And that's growing close to 30%. And followed by the IT Services business, which is really GoToAssist, that's kind of a mid-teens grower, and then, of course, with remote access and cloud being more of a mature market. The new markets that you talked about around data sharing is starting to contribute and it will be a ramp as we get through the year. So I think the way to think about the actual growth rates is probably mid- to high-teens as for the full year and then depending upon how quickly we're able to ramp the data sharing business, we may be able to accelerate that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions for you. The first is any sense now, I know we've had, historically, this question of license overhang from licenses that were purchased in substantial numbers and then are in the process of being implemented. Any sense of how you're doing in terms of the deployment of those?","David James Henshall","Mark, I don't think we have great data in terms of -- in the aggregate of how many licenses are purchased and deployed in the timescales. But surely on every large transaction we've got, our services people working hand-in-hand with customers to make sure that licenses are getting deployed and being successful in rolling them out. And we understand how the projects are going. The best metric we have around that is we look at reorder rates, that's something that we've looked at and the time to reorder. And the measurement there is simply when a customer makes an initial large purchase, how long does it take before they come back for a subsequent one. That has moved around anywhere from about 6 to 8 months. And I think that's probably the way to think about it, and obviously that's longer as the deals get much, much larger and now that we've got a growing number of customers north of 10,000 seats, we've got a lot of big deals out there. So we're working on it, and I think that's about it.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So it's still staying within roughly the same range?","David James Henshall","Yes. I think so. The only other thing I'd add on top of that is that the idea of like ELA-type transactions, while we are doing a number of large deals, those are certainly the exception for us. I mean, our large deals are typically customers have a specific identified project that they want to execute against. And it just happens to be for a very large number of users, more so than taking down an all-you-can-eat type arrangement. So that's pretty consistent with where we've been in last few years.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Second quick question. Any feedback -- I know you've made changes in terms of the sales channel structure at the high-end of clients. Any feedback on the success of that as well as the sense from the channel in terms of whether there's been push back?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Mark. I think we actually have continued to evolve our channel programs in a very, very consistent way. And that is to reward channel partners who are there in the marketplace, really delivering solutions and stimulating demand, and really engaged in the process and doing less and less to reward kind of harvesting. And I think that's it. And in exchange for that, what we're doing is investing much more energy in managing those partners that are doing those kinds of things. So they're actually -- it's an upward spiral. They make more money because they get more of our focus and they get more rewards for doing the things that they're actually very competent at, and that is driving demand and solutions. So that's really the nature of what we've done. And maybe David can add some little color around this.","David James Henshall","No. I would just add, we introduced the concept of high touch accounts and we've been investing a lot in ERMs, corporate account managers across the globe. And this is a way for us to frankly not double comp from a financial perspective, but also get people focused, as Mark said, on driving core demand, not necessarily selling alongside of Citrix or harvesting any existing accounts but really driving brand new demand. So that's where most of these changes took place. We also made a few minor tweaks to our, we call our, Subscription Advantage agency fee and that is, we lowered it in a couple of areas and used those funds to reinvest in driving other core initiatives. So when you hear of channel changes and what not, you should think of those as simply tools, tools that we're using to turn the dials in terms of our current business initiatives. And generally, it's not a net cost reduction or as we call it, a channel benefit reduction, it's simply a reallocation.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, just back on the deferred, obviously, one of the better growth year-on-year quarters you've had in a while. Are you seeing some of the contract terms elongate given the large deal accounts starting to get not much bigger where you're seeing your average contract term now lengthening.","David James Henshall","Well, I'd say not lengthening an average contract. Most contracts are still a year. The large deal contracts are the ones that do tend to be sometimes 2, 3 or 4 years in duration but not enough of a material change right now. I think it's going to track relatively closely to large deals. And I talked about those earlier what we did in the aggregate, 28 deals over $1 million in Q1, which compares to 14 a year ago. So the trend is certainly up and to the right. And because of that, I think you'll see a continued growth in long-term deferred. And it will be growing at a percent that it was in Q1, I would expect, but it's really a trend that's happening. And I'm not sure I'd add much more beyond that. That's something we'll continue to talk about each quarter. And just some reflection of the more strategic nature of the business.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. A quick follow-up for Mark on NetScaler 10. Are there any new markets that you feel this is going to open up? And if you could just comment maybe a little bit about the service provider market and what you're seeing in that end market?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Brent. I think it does give us incremental reach directly into carrier networks, as well as into the expansion in the service provider space. And again, the notion, core notion of tri-scale includes the service delivery platform that can consolidate the higher-level set of delivery services, not only the ones that we provide, but delivery services that our ecosystem partners provide around analytics, security, mobile data, some other kinds of functions that are important to carriers. So I think it does give us incremental reach. And we'll will do some more in that -- some more to actually amplify the reach that we get to telcos and carriers, as well as just infrastructure to the service providers as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Guys, couple questions. First, this time last year you gave us the target for what Desktop license that you thought would grow for the year. Obviously, you put up a good quarter there. Any thoughts now in terms of that trend? Do you feel like this is a year in which you have acceleration in that? And just given the [ph] target and any visibility at this point this year?","David James Henshall","Sure, Michael. We haven't really broken up the various line items of revenue right now. But I think that coming off of a good Q1, up 17% year-on-year, and last year we were up almost 20%, and we feel like this is certainly a business that is becoming very material. And while we do have hard comps, as we enter the back of the year, I think the early read would will be somewhere in the kind of low to mid teens, and we know we'll update that as we go through the year.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one question on the license update and maintenance. The 19% is for group overall, is that something that we felt like should headed to the teens as all that licenses rolled in. Any reason not to think that one's sustainable?","David James Henshall","Yes, I think we had a huge growth in deferred in Q4 and some of that is bleeding back in. So the baseline goes up. But as far as overall growth rates, it's probably in the mid-teens from license updates for this year.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then how [indiscernible], is any inorganic revenue?","David James Henshall","In the license update and maintenance line? No.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","No. I'm sorry. In revenues overall this quarter. I may have missed it earlier.","David James Henshall","There's a little bit. I mean, I think the acquisitions that we did in the back half of last year, just to kind of remind everybody, the way that we had talked about those, the solution for those businesses over the first half of the year was about $0.10 from an EPS standpoint and that's because we're taking a lot of brand new nation businesses and we're building out everything from sales overlay teams, engineering teams to drive integration and core development and all the other ancillary parts and ramping those pretty rapidly right now. And I think by the time we exit Q4, we'll be on an annualized revenue run rate of north of $50 million. And by that point, at least neutral and probably accretive EPS.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire of CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I noticed that the Pacific region was notably strong. Could you comment on what may be behind that? And also, Dave, you had mentioned you're looking to accelerate your hiring. Maybe some color there in terms of where you're planning to up your investments over the last quarter or so.","David James Henshall","Sure, Ed. In terms of APAC and Japan, or Pacific and Japan, I mean both of those regions continue to just have a terrific execution. I mean we've got great teams there. We've got early markets like China and India and others that are growing significantly faster than the overall business right now, we provide a lot of long-term opportunity. We've also been investing a lot in terms of just overall capacity there. So we're bringing on board lots of people to service accounts locally, whether that is from a support standpoint, customer facing engagements, et cetera, and are going to continue to do that because there's just a lot of opportunity there. And I expect to have, as I said in my prepared, to continue to outgrow the market for at least the balance of this year. Sorry, can you repeat the second part of your question?","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just you mentioned you're looking to accelerate you're hiring because it was off to a bit of a slow start in the first quarter. Just where you're hoping to invest geographically and in product lines?","David James Henshall","Got it. Yes, we hired about 140 people in the quarter, bringing our total headcount to actually 7,075 people across the company right now. That hiring was lower than we had in our original plan. But a number of people have actually accepted offers. They're going to be starting in early Q2. We expect that the pace is going to be able to pick up as we go into Q2 and probably early Q3. The places that, that hiring is going are all the identified areas that we've talked about in the past -- a lot of focus on GoToMarket coverage. We do feel like we're capacity constrained in a number of areas around the world. In customer support, make sure that we are transferring the right level of knowledge to be able to support customer deployments as well as post-deployment support. And then of course across various elements of innovation, whether those are the new businesses that we're just ramping up or whether it's in just core innovation to drive integrations across our products, leveraging simplicity and solution approach, et cetera or new innovation, so across-the-board in all those different spaces.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Richard Sherlund of Nomura.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A question on the pipeline relating to XenDesktop. I'm kind of curious if there's like a bulge going through the pipe, where a lot of deals might be coming up for a decision or is it more linear? And kind of relating to that, if you could just chat a moment about the sales cycle on XenDesktop, kind of where are we? Have we gone past the evangelism stage? And is the sales cycle getting shorter? I'm just curious, do more go to pilot, or if they are bigger deals, do they not need as extensive a pilot? Just some appreciation for that would be helpful.","David James Henshall","Sure, Rick. Let me take the second part of the question. In terms of just the overall sales cycle, I think it's safe to assume that every large deal out there is first, a competitive deal, and so you generally have us and some other technology tilted up side-by-side as the customer goes through more of a functionality approach. And then, some level of proof of concept. I mean that's generally the pattern that every customer is going to go through. And so as far as total cycle times, it just depends on so many different factors. I'd say an existing account, it can be very short, measured in a matter of weeks up through several quarters for a large new customer. In terms of looking at whether we're in an evangelical space or what not, the news is we've got thousands of accounts now that are out there running XenDesktop in deployment. We've got hundreds that are in the multi-thousands, and we've got references across every geo and I believe every major vertical out there. So it's not like it's a brand-new technology anymore. It's much more a function of just getting it in front of a customer, helping them understand how to deploy and then focusing on ramping that long term. In terms of the pipeline, I don't think there's a bulge in the pipeline, pent-up demand or anything along those lines. I mean pipeline and pipeline creation is something that we just focus on day in and day out across the globe, building new opportunity pipeline and working that through the chain. I will say that the one kind of unique thing in the pipeline, which by the way has continued to grow in the aggregate pipeline creation and coverage ratios are strong. But the one unique thing is probably around the larger deals. That is what we see more and more and more of over time. And so the number of identified million dollar plus opportunities is effectively a record each and every quarter. So that's consistent with all the other dynamics that we've seen in this business.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And is Windows 7 helping or hurting? Is it causing some distraction right now where people feel like they -- with end-of-life coming for XP, they've got to focus on getting Windows 7 in place and later, they'll come back and consider the infrastructure? Or is it actually helping?","David James Henshall","I'd say it's definitely helping. I mean it initiates the conversation around the Desktop infrastructure, and that's the time when you have a great opportunity to talk about whether that is physical or virtual. And we also participate pretty actively in migrations, to help customers understand how their app portfolio is going to perform across different platforms, et cetera. So it's been identified as a driver in some of our larger transactions, and it's certainly a driver for just overall conversations and opportunity.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood, Susquehanna Financial.","James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A couple of questions on the Desktop business. I'm not sure if you're still giving this, but if you are, what was the change in deferred revenue from the Desktop business?","David James Henshall","We didn't really give that out. But we did say that the majority of the change was related to the Desktop business.","James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then second on the 5.5 release, I think it was last December, that included the RingCube technology, I was hoping to get some feedback on kind of what customers are saying and how does this impacting your pipeline. Then lastly, if I could just squeeze this in there from a high-level perspective, I mean, is there anything that suggests we are starting to hit more of an inflection point in adoption of Desktop Virtualization? Or should we really still think of it as a continued gradual rise as we've seen over the last couple of years?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes. I'm going to stick by the point that there's no such thing as an inflection point in enterprise IT, and I've said that quarter in and quarter out, because I think the dynamics needed to really ramp these businesses are -- they're fairly labor-intensive. That includes just our ability to train partners, our ability to the hire consultants, our ability to have the customers have the appropriate level of knowledge and guidance to ramp. So I do think it's a gradual process. I mean, we're talking about very, very big numbers now. So I mean this has rapidly become a quite a real market, and we think a lot of headroom is still out there. In terms of the 5.5 and the overall release, we've got very positive feedback from it. I'm not sure I have any specific statistics around RingCube per se, but when you look at the reasons why we're winning, the regions reasons why customers are engaging and the types of deployments, those are really unchanged. The 5.5 release had so many advancements in everything from performance, scalability, management and then, of course, cost. I mean, cost is one that we're bringing it down, as Mark talked about earlier, below the cost of physical in many cases, and RingCube is a core element of that. So we're on to version 5.6 now and stay tuned for what's coming.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the time allotted for questions. Are there any closing comments?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks. So, just a couple of closing comments. First, thanks for the kind words that a number of you said, and we're pretty excited about our performance, as you can tell. We're confident about what we're doing from here into the future, so please come to Synergy. If you can come, pay attention to what we have to say, and I hope to see you in the next 3 months where we'll have another report. And until then, take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Fleites, you may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites","Thank you, Jamaira. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 earnings presentation.  Participating in the call will be Mark Templeton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Henshall, Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Financial Officer.","This call is being webcast on Citrix System's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product classification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Securities laws.

David?","David James Henshall","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As you can see from the release, we finished off the year with a strong Q4 and great momentum across our businesses, delivering $740 million in total revenue, up 19%; a 17% growth in product and license; $227 million in cash flow from ops; and adjusted EPS of $0.90 a share.","I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers, partners and teams around the world for all the great work and continued support throughout 2012.","Operationally, we've been very focused on driving leadership across desktop virtualization, cloud infrastructure and collaboration, giving customers the tools they need to manage rapidly changing work style. These trends can be clearly seen in our results.","In Q4, we closed 55 transactions greater than $1 million each, with strength coming from businesses in the healthcare and financial services sectors.","Strategically important to us is the fact that 30% of these orders included multiple products, demonstrating the value of the integrated solutions that we can uniquely deliver to customers. Also, several of these orders included additional years of license updates and maintenance contributing to the growth we saw in the long-term deferred revenue balance.","Geographically, Q4 demand patterns were fairly stable around the world. The Americas grew 14%, EMEA was up 19% and the Pacific\/Japan region increased 52% from last year. So overall a very strong close across the board and a great way to finish the year.","Before we move on, I'd like to remind everyone that we closed the acquisition of Zenprise in early January. We expect our new mobile platforms business will add about $30 million of total revenue in 2013 and be dilutive to EPS by about $0.09, largely in the first half of the year.","Beginning in Q1, we'll be combining these results and the current Desktop Solutions grouping into a new category simply called Mobile & Desktop. This closely aligns to our go-to-market motion, and we are strategically positioning the products and how customers are currently thinking about enterprise mobility.","So let's look at the Q4 results within our 3 primary businesses. First, our Desktop business grew 11% to over $411 million, including license growth of 2% off a tough comp from a year ago.","For context on the business in Q4, there's a few metrics that really demonstrate the breadth of adoption we're seeing and the strategic value that customers are placing on desktop virtualization within their infrastructure.","In Q4, there were 42 transactions greater than $1 million for the Desktop products, representing customers in healthcare, Federal government, financial services, education and others.","In total, nearly 4,000 different customers bought XenDesktop in Q4, including more than 240 individual transactions for more than 1,000 seats; 48 orders greater than 5,000 seats; and 18 that were over 10,000 seats. And over $100 million of the sequential increase in deferred revenue was due to software license updates and maintenance for the Desktop products.","Customers are looking at desktop transformation as a way to accelerate their business imperatives. For example, a global health services provider leveraging XenDesktop to enable thousands of employees with any device access to apps and desktops as part of their flex-working and home-sourcing initiatives. Or a financial services firm in Japan, purchasing over 20,000 XD licenses as a key component of their Windows XP migration project, allowing them to manage application compatibility while reducing costs. Or European bank selecting XenDesktop, NetScaler SDX and CloudGateway to help the company mobilize our workforce and support a broad BYOD program.","We're increasingly talking to customers about business enable-ment, reducing the cost of their desktop infrastructure and increasing productivity by enabling enterprise mobility options.","With our unique FlexCast delivery technology, we've moved the conversation far beyond simple VDI to one where customers can choose the ideal solution tailored to different user groups, business needs and IT strategy.","Next, in our Networking & Cloud business, total revenue increased by 51% in the quarter to $156 million, with product and license revenue increasing 57%.","The NetScaler product family was again the major driver of growth in the quarter, with new licenses up 38% year-on-year. We're continuing to execute against our strategies to leverage NetScaler as part of delivering integrated solutions to customers, as well as broadening our go-to-market coverage. For example, in the enterprise, the cross-sell and attach motions drove over 700 desktop orders during Q4 that included NetScaler as part of the solution. Our NetScaler VPX virtual appliances were up nearly 80% year-on-year, contributing about 8% of NetScaler license revenue. And the NetScaler SDX platform, designed to enable full multi-tenancy and consolidation within the Data Center, continues to gain momentum with both service providers and large enterprise, growing more than 200% from last year and now representing more than 15% of NetScaler sales.","And finally, our business in mobile carrier networks contributed over $20 million in revenue, primarily driven by the Bytemobile solutions and the pull-through of NetScalers into these accounts.","Within our Collaboration & Sharing business, SaaS revenue was up 18% to $135 million. And the GoToMeeting family continues to be the primary driver here, growing 26% in Q4.","Geographically, the investments we've been making to expand our SaaS business internationally are delivering good results, with revenue from International markets now accounting for over 15% of the total.","And also in Q4, we launched ShareFile with StorageZones, giving users the convenience of cloud-based data sharing across all devices while providing IT with the ability to choose where data is stored, including on-premises within their own secure data centers.","So turning to operations. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 87%, down from 89% a year ago. So as we've forecasted, we've seen a slow but steady increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue. And the driver behind this is simply the mix of revenue as we've been very successful diversifying the business into Networking & Cloud and SaaS solutions. This trend will continue through 2013 as we continue to grow these businesses.","But despite the reduction in gross margin, adjusted operating margins were 30% in Q4, up more than 500 basis points sequentially due primarily to the increase in total revenue.","Our investments in headcount growth continued to be in 2 primary areas: First, expanding go-to-market reach and customer direct touch through enterprise account managers, consulting capacity and tech support; and second, in product innovation, to bring to market new technologies, as well as improving the integration of solutions to drive simplicity and better end-user experience.","In total, we added 121 new people in the fourth quarter and, for the full year, added over 1,200 people across the company, bringing year-end headcount to about 8,200.","And finally, the adjusted tax rate was 24%, up from 21.5% last year, reflecting the relative mix of domestic versus International results, partially offset by year-end adjustments to our annual tax provision.","And looking at the balance sheet, cash and investments increased to $1.5 billion due to cash flow from operations of $227 million, up 34% year-on-year.","For the full year, we generated $818 million from ops an increase of 21% compared to 2011.","In Q4, we bought back 1.2 million shares of stock, bringing the full year total to almost 4 million repurchased.","The other item to note on the balance sheet is deferred revenue. The total balance at the end of the year was $1.2 billion, an increase of $145 million sequentially. And while the total was up 25% last year, the long-term deferred increased by 65%, reflecting the evolution in customer relationship to a more strategic level.","And as I mentioned earlier, we had a larger number of orders in Q4 where customers initiated multiyear commitments that are generally recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.","So overall, we executed well in Q4 and throughout 2012. We're driving growth in all of our primary businesses, and we're making the investments necessary to extend our leadership position in the future.","Finally, I'd like to discuss our current outlook and expectations for 2013. As we entered the year, customer activity metrics and pipeline remains strong in all geos. We're focused on delivering financial results while expanding our long-term capacity across our 3 main businesses.","Including the dilution from the Zenprise acquisition, we're currently forecasting a business model with 25% adjusted operating margins for the full year. This allows us to invest in 2 main areas. First, go-to-market coverage to increase our market position around the world with a much stronger emphasis on networking; and second, in the adjacent market opportunities in mobile carrier networks and enterprise mobility management. This will include development, integration and the product specialist teams necessary to bring these products to market.","So for the full year 2013, we're increasing our current expectations to include total revenue in the range of $2.95 billion to $2.98 billion, an adjusted tax rate of 20% to 22% and adjusted EPS of $3.12 to $3.15 per share.","And for the first quarter of 2013, we currently expect total revenue to be in a range of $670 million to $680 million and adjusted EPS of between $0.62 and $0.63 a share.","Included in the first quarter guidance is $0.06 of EPS dilution related to the Zenprise acquisition and a net tax benefit of approximately $9 million due to the extension of the 2012 Federal R&D tax credit.","So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks a lot, David. We're pleased to report record results for the quarter today and for 2012, both financially and strategically.","Steadfast execution across core markets and diverse routes to market is 2012 story, with strength in key measures including large deals with High Touch accounts, new customer acquisition and retention, subscription and maintenance renewals and technical services growth. I'm also quite pleased with how we performed in our new product lines like ShareFile, CloudPlatform and Bytemobile.","I'm really extremely proud of the Citrix team and our partners whose hard work and perseverance were tested by a tenuous macro environment throughout the year. I think this says something special about the Citrix culture and why once again we were recognized by Glassdoor as a Top 50 best place to work.","The speed of transformation is accelerating across all our key businesses. Nothing, however, is dominating CIO mindshare more than mobility and the drive to enable a more mobile work style for employees.","As I talked with CIOs around the world, the message is clear. They're looking for better ways to embrace the challenges and opportunities of IT consumerization, generational changes, business consolidation and geophysical disruptions.","At the same time, it's equally clear that IT is no longer in the driver seat. The agenda is increasingly being driven by the forces of BYO, personal cloud services and a born digital workforce.","Consumer innovation is driving the shift from Windows PCs as the singular platform for work to a vast array of devices, apps and data that includes Windows. That's why we're completely focused on cloud computing technologies that enable mobile work styles, mobilizing apps, data, workloads, networks and people, and helping customers drive true business value.","As we look into 2013 and beyond, we're in great position to benefit from these trends in the way we work, the devices and apps we use and the way services are delivered to us.","So next I'd like to address each of these market opportunities beginning with Mobile and Desktop.  I'm pleased with the Q4 momentum we saw at Desktop Virtualization and our strong finish across the board. Our pipeline is at record levels, fueled by Desktop TCO, data security and business transformation, as well as the need to deliver Windows apps to a broader range of mobile and BYO devices.","The next generation of XenDesktop and XenApp, now in tech preview, will further accelerate this momentum with a focus on simplification, on mobility and on building on the strength of Windows Server 2012. The feedback we've heard from customers and partners so far has been fantastic.","We're also extending our reach beyond Windows, with solutions for native mobile platforms like iOS, Android and HTML 5, addressing the highly adjacent enterprise mobility market. We took another major step in January with the acquisition of Zenprise, a Gartner Magic Quadrant leader in the rapidly growing mobile device management market. Zenprise gives Citrix an outstanding team of mobility experts, a great solution for managing mobile devices and impressive market momentum with over 1,400 customers across every industry segment.","The Zenprise MDM product is a perfect complement to CloudGateway, our solution for mobile app management.","The new CloudGateway 2.5 announced at Synergy Barcelona adds support for native mobile apps with our new MDX technology and has a natural adjacency to XenApp and XenDesktop. It's already creating great add-on and upsell opportunities.","In Q4, for example, we closed a large enterprise mobility deal with a global financial services team. The solution included CloudGateway, XenDesktop and NetScaler to service the mobility needs of nearly 10,000 users, supporting BYO, custom mobile apps and workplace mobility. This is our opportunity to deliver a complete enterprise mobility solution across devices, apps and data, to leverage our base as they bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobility and to do it all with a beautiful consumer-like experience that sets Citrix apart.","We'll have a number of exciting announcements in this space throughout 2013, so stay tuned.","Next, I'd like to discuss our Networking & Cloud business. Powering mobile work styles requires a new approach to building and delivering services for end users. Our business here is focused in 2 key areas: CloudPlatform solutions designed from the ground up to let anyone build true anything as a service cloud, and cloud networking solutions, allowing enterprisers and providers to deliver these services to any device with the best performance, security and reliability.","At the platform level, our strategy is focused on Apache CloudStack, the most widely deployed open source platform in this emerging market, with hundreds of customers in production including some of the biggest brands in the world. We've monetized this business through Citrix CloudPlatform, our commercial implementation of CloudStack. Last quarter, we saw a continued momentum in this space with significant deployments across the enterprise, university and telco segments. While others talk about the cloud, we're building it.","Next is cloud networking, led by our NetScaler platform. NetScaler continues to outpace the market, gaining ground in all key segments and taking share.  We're doing this by out-innovating the competition. First is our TriScale technology, making it really easy to scale delivery networks up, in and out for customers of any size. This innovation lets NetScaler deliver a stunning 1.4 terabytes of throughput in a single cluster, that's more than 8x the capacity of our largest competitor.","We're also driving innovation in form factor with NetScaler MPX and VPX, making it easy to deploy any mix of virtual and physical appliances and also making it easy to consolidate and simplify with our SDX platform, which runs up to 40 independent NetScaler instances on a single appliance.","Best of all, SDX is now open to third-party vendors. So for the first time ever, customers can consolidate best-in-class app networking services in a single consolidated footprint with a single integrated way to apply app-driven policies company-wide.","As industry momentum shifts up stack to more strategic software-defined networks, we're in a great position to continue taking share.","In Q4, we also unveiled an exciting new alliance with Cisco focused on networking, cloud and mobility. We're working together to integrate NetScaler into a broad range of Cisco networking, security and data center solutions. As part of this agreement, Cisco is recommending NetScaler to customers who want to migrate from Cisco ACE to a next-generation app delivery controller. We've already closed several significant deals just 2 short months after the announcement. It's an exciting partnership we believe will have a positive impact, especially as we introduce new integrated solutions in the months ahead.","The final piece of our cloud networking strategy is Bytemobile, which extends our reach into the mobile carrier network for the first time. Q4 was our first full quarter selling Bytemobile, and I'm extremely pleased with the results. This market is still very new for us, but we are encouraged by the early signs and excited about the additional market reach it gives us.","Finally, I'd like to address how we're bringing in all together for end users with cloud-based services for Collaboration & Sharing. No matter how you look at it, the way people work is changing, driven by an unprecedented convergence of mobile, social and generational forces. Employees today want to move seamlessly across a diverse mix of devices and locations throughout the day, collaborating with others, sharing information as they go. Enabling this transformation is a central part of our mobile work style strategy and a key differentiator for us in the market. Our relentless focus on simplicity, and user experience has allowed products like GoToMeeting to outpace the rest of the collaboration market, taking share from competitors and giving us great market region brand visibility with end users.  It's also given us a strong head start with new products like ShareFile as we bring that same focus and mindset to the world of data sharing.","I'm very pleased with our progress in these markets and our potential to drive even faster growth as we introduce them to a wider audience of enterprise customers through our mobile work styles' message and strategy.","In closing, we feel good about the momentum we're carrying into 2013. We're confident in our core business strategies and our new investments in enterprise mobility, data sharing and cloud platforms. Workforce and technology transformations are driving a broad range of new business initiatives, IT strategies and business model innovations.","Most transitions like this take longer than we think. For IT, however, this one is different. The forces of consumerization are dictating the pace, driving an urgency to move fast. No one is better positioned to help customers with these transitions than Citrix.","And now, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Looking at your guidance for Q1 and for the year, the midpoint of growth is roughly the same, I think, for Q1 as it is for all of 2013. And given the ramp in the Bytemobile business, the Cisco relationship and even inorganic contribution from Zenprise, why would growth not improve in the second half? Or is there something else that's weighing against that growth rate?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Rob. It's David. Let me try to characterize it for you. I mean first off, it's early in 2013. We're not prepared to give too much granular guidance around the individual lines of business at this point in time. But I'd say at a high level, the way to think about the guidance in total for 2013 is this: total new product license growth in the mid -- the kind of low to mid teens, that would include Networking & Cloud, license up about 30% year-on-year; Mobile and Desktop business with new licenses in kind of a mid- single-digit range; and then the other line items are ratable and those will flow from there. So again, don't want to get too granular at this point in time in individual products partially because of the time in the year, and frankly partially because we're more often going to market and selling strategic solutions that include multiple technologies together. And so as we go through the year, we'll update these numbers and we'll give a lot more context around each quarter's business, how customers are consuming and what they're actually purchasing, et cetera. So that's the way I think about that at this point.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then for Mark, you mentioned how mobility is definitely top of mind for CIOs. As you look across your portfolio of capabilities, and now you have the addition of Zenprise, any missing holes there or do you think you have the complete solution at this point?","Mark B. Templeton","Rob, I think there are always things that we're doing on the innovation front to fill gaps, but they'll tend to be smaller ones at this point because I think right now we're lined up to be, I think, in the lead in terms of offering the most complete solution from the mobile OS all the way through the kinds of apps that you need to actually go mobile when it comes to collaboration, when it comes to communication, access to Internet apps, and the wide variety of not only native apps but also the Windows apps and desktops that are so important to a full mobility strategy. So we really like where we are in terms of completeness. And a huge priority for the year will be to get to greater and greater levels of integration so that the user experience, the customer experience, the admin experience gets better, better, better, easier and easier. That will be in conjunction with what we believe will be greater and greater number of devices and users under management.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just like to drill down on the Networking business and the kind of eye-opening growth here, we're seeing 57% growth in license. So I just want to get some color on were there any inordinately large deals, the status of the pipeline, did we drain the pipeline? And if -- maybe if any of the new products got particular traction?","David James Henshall","Sure, Steve. It's David. Thanks by the way. We're really happy with the results for Q4. Specifically to the Networking business, let me take it up a click a little bit and talk about it more broadly because at a high level, we believe like others that the data center network is going through a pretty big transition currently and over the next few years, driven by cloud architecture, SaaS, mobility, et cetera. And this is the lens that we've been thinking about this for some time. And so when you look at the initiatives that I talked about in my prepared remarks and some of the individual results, you're seeing greater penetration into our traditional enterprise accounts, fastest-growing part of the business in Q4. This is true from both a cross-sell motion, as well as attach motion. I called out 700 individual desktop orders that included NetScaler as part of the solution, and this compares to about just 400 last quarter. We're talking about increasing the flexibility of architectural deployments with the virtual appliances, giving customers a lot more flexibility in how they look at their own infrastructure. That part of the business, new in the last, say, 6 quarters is up about 80% year-on-year. And then the big driver being the XDX platform, which really helps effectively consolidate Layers 4-7 services in the Data Center. And that's been up over 200% year-on-year. So you see all those things in what I call the core network business doing really, really well, and of course continued strong business from dot-coms and [indiscernible] providers. And then the last piece that I mentioned is our business in mobile carrier networks. We're starting to see what I'll call a Bytemobile effect, okay? So we did about $20 million in this segment, with more than $15 million coming from Bytemobile products, as well as a pull-through related to NetScalers. So really just opening up a brand new market opportunity that we hadn't participated in the past. So you put all these things together and we're very optimistic about the business, really happy with the execution. And specific to Cisco, as you mentioned, Mark talked about a few individual transactions, we're getting good, good traction there right out of the gate. But we're in the really early stages of working with Cisco on a long-term strategic partnership. It's going to include go-to-market, joint development, joint selling, et cetera. So stay tuned on that front.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Sonya Banerjee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Sonya Banerjee on for Heather Bellini. Well, just in terms of the Desktop solution business, I guess we're curious. What impact did shelfware related to XenDesktop licenses have on the growth rate in 2012, and how far has this been worked down? I guess in other words, did you guys start 2013 with a chance for accelerating growth if that shelfware issue was worked through in 2012?","David James Henshall","Yes, it's David. Let met talk about this. So I'm not sure we've ever described the shelfware issue, and we certainly don't look at the business that way. I mean, if you look at what is going on from individual quarters, and I talked about some very specific statistics within just Q4 in terms of like the types of business or the types of initiatives that customers are looking at when they're deploying virtualization of the desktop and some stats around new customers about 4,000 customers in total, purchasing new licenses of XenDesktop, 240 buying more than 1,000 seats and almost 20 with 10,000 seats. So these are new deployments, new initiatives and new customers. And so everybody is going to adopt and deploy at a -- at their own pace depending on their own capabilities, business initiatives, funding, et cetera. But we're not aware of like a broad shelfware issue certainly in the market at all. I will say that as we look into 2013, we are doing a number of things to address the area of complexity, ease of adoption, ease of management, ease of scale, and that's where the releases under the Avalon umbrella come in to really transforming desktop virtualization into a delivered service, making it much, much easier for customers to adopt and scale. So number of new initiatives on that front.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe just to start on that point, the tone around linearity in the demand environment seems to have changed quite a bit from the last conference call. Do you think that has to do with year-end spend? Does it have to do with better execution on your part, more conservative assumptions? How would you contrast sort of what you saw in the market quarter-on-quarter?","David James Henshall","Yes, Adam. I'd say there's nothing new on the economic front. In general, there continues to be some level of volatility in the timing of closing business. And that's true just in pockets throughout the world. But all geos had a good performance in Q4, very focused on execution, continuing to work with customers on opportunities from earlier in the year, really understanding their priorities and relative -- really relatively how we think about wallet share. So the key verticals in Q4, I mentioned earlier included pretty much across the board: healthcare, [indiscernible] services, cloud service providers, education, government. So good balance. The key is going to be trying to understand customers' priorities, make sure we've got the right solutions to make their initiatives successful and then just stay very, very close to them and help get these transactions over the line.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could just ask a follow-up on the Desktop business, there was a point this year where we were talking about double-digit license growth in the Desktop business. And now it looks like you're guiding to sort of a flat to up slightly organic Desktop number for calendar '13. What do you see is the difference between those 2 growth rates and if there's still the opportunity to get back to double-digit organic license growth in that business?","Mark B. Templeton","Sure, Adam. And if we think about the Desktop business as a whole, I mean it's actually a fairly large business for us right now. It's about -- well, it's a little over $0.5 billion [ph] in new product license last year and about nearly $1.5 billion in total revenue. And so as we think about next year, the mid-single digits is kind of where we want to be right now. The market is still we believe in its early phase. It is transitioning a little bit from a customer conversation to look at DV in the context of broader enterprise mobility, and we're obviously doing a number of things on that front. And then what I mentioned earlier on Sonya's question about just continuing to make it easier for customers to adopt and scale and manage by bringing down the complexity, which I think has been a barrier to adoption in the past. And so as Avalon technologies come out in the latter parts of this year, we'll be really, really focused on that. So that's our current thinking. It's early in the year, and we do remain very optimistic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mark, just wanted to focus in actually on the Zenprise deal. Wonder if you could talk about just the early feedback you've had from customers, especially when you think of Zenprise in the context of CloudGateway that you've been talking about plus just Citrix Receiver, obviously.","Mark B. Templeton","Well, thanks for the kind comments, Phil. We're pretty excited about the deal and what it means to our ability to assert not only our strategy in enterprise mobility, but also how to actually incorporate our desktop virtualization technologies and business in leveraging that phase. So it really feels good. That's sort of the glue that's going to bring all these together. The -- it turns out we have shared partners and customers that stepped up during the due diligence and really confirms what we were thinking, and that was pretty exciting and continues to be that way. So the businesses continued to grow both on the CloudGateway side and on the Zenprise side, where customers are saying this is good, this can only be synergistic. And I'd say that of many, many adjacent technology transactions that we have done over the years, this one has the least amount of duplication and the most, I'd say, synergistic possibilities. And that's really what we'll be, in the marketplace, talking about is how Zenprise MDM will allow us to configure and provision devices and manage all the settings and security and so forth from the mobile OS and then hand off and push apps and then hand off to CloudGateway for all of the SSL, Single Sign-On, app store and mobile app capabilities that we talked about at Synergy, Barcelona, that we're calling our Me@Work mobile apps family. So it really is sort of the key sum that brings it all together. And then, obviously, every customer that already is running the XenApp and XenDesktop will be able to snap right into this infrastructure from a technical point of view, but also we're making it really easy for them to add on to a desktop virtualization solution and add this mobility capability as well. So I'd say in our outlook, this is what we see now. We are going to be a little bit cautious of how fast the synergies actually are manifested in our revenue, but we're pretty excited about it and you can be sure that we're going to be extremely aggressive and run at a very high velocity here. So as I said in my comments, stay tuned.","Operator","Next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore Partners.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess, Mark, this is a little bit more of a follow-on to Phil's question about Zenprise. I mean you guys have been talking to people about virtualizing apps and mobility from an app standpoint for a long time. I guess, just bringing the mobility factor in, I guess how critical is that in terms of gaining mindshare really with CIOs and really having almost a top-down approach to selling? And along those lines, is there anything you really need to do with the current sales motions with your sales guys to be able to bring in sort of the mobility piece of it? Is there anything you need to do from a marketing or go-to-market standpoint as you serve -- transition to even more of an enterprise mobility story?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks, Kirk. So a few things. First, think about this as enabling 3 points -- 3 entry points into the customer around mobility now going forward. The first one is this add-on capability. So we've helped you mobilize Windows apps and desktops. Now we can help you move beyond that with native mobile apps, data and devices, and that's basically the combination of XenDesktop, XenApp, CloudGateway and Zenprise technologies in a seamless kind of package. So that's one -- that's very much a top-down where this is really a holistic approach to mobility that reaches beyond just lighting up a smartphone or tablet or a BYO initiative, et cetera. It really is a -- very much a top-down strategic offer. The second is the other end of the spectrum, and that is the mobility and the security sort of dimension where the buyers that are responsible for the existing mobile platforms very typically to support BlackBerry and so forth. They're looking at all the same issues that everyone is looking at, looking for management capabilities of devices from the OS up. So the Zenprise MDM gives us an entry point there, and the specialty sales force that comes over from Zenprise and manage that way as an overlay allows us to continue that momentum and that entry point with the -- obviously, the prospect of up-selling. Because as those buyers actually get more knowledgeable about these kinds of solutions, they naturally ask about, what about data, what about native mobile apps, what about the security of these apps and so forth. So that's the second one. And then the third one is really the new customer where the entry point is all around mobility, and that -- that's one where we'll spend time really building our brand, tying it to mobile work styles and stimulating customers that haven't yet considered Citrix in their overall mobility infrastructure. In that area, there's branding, there's messaging, there's a lot of demand-generation activities to do. And that will build over the course of the year. And you'll start to see that in the first half. And as I said earlier, we'll be aggressive about it. And as David mentioned, this is one of the key investment areas for us. So we need to have focus on making the products beautifully integrated. That'll be a 2-step process. Secondly, build capacity in the go-to-market starting with the specialty overlay sales force and training the rest of our field, as well as recruiting our partners into the go-to-market motion. And then the third area is obviously around demand generation and getting visibility for Citrix in mobile. And I think obviously, it's not a big stretch. The company is long stood for mobile, start going way back to the roots in remote access. So it's actually -- it's not a stretch at all, just something that -- it's about execution.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Kenneth Wong","David, this is Ken Wong from Citi in for Walter. I think earlier, you said you guys saw a $100 million in incremental deferred coming from Desktop. I'm just wondering if you could perhaps give us a sense for what that number was last year?","David James Henshall","From an incremental standpoint, I don't have that handy. It was definitely smaller than this year. I mean, that is the majority of the growth in deferred on a sequential basis. And the other components would be our longer-term SaaS business, support agreements and other types of maintenance.","Kenneth Wong","Yes, okay. And then also on Asia, I mean you guys saw 50% growth there. Was there something significant there in terms of big deals or something one-time in nature there or is it just you guys are getting better traction?","David James Henshall","Well, I think that in general, our Pacific and Japan regions have just done a really good job this year. I mean they are 2 smaller regions, and they've been having a much higher growth rates than the 2 larger markets. And they just continue to execute really well. Japan, in particular, had a really strong quarter in a number of different areas across both Desktop and Networking products, so very happy with the team there. And we continue to think about those as growth areas going forward, and we'll be investing behind that pretty heavily.","Operator","Our next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a follow-on on the regions. And the one thing we see now so far in the companies that reported was that Europe is actually doing pretty decent despite all the fears that we had in there. Can you -- I mean VMware talked about the budget flush in Q4 and was nervous about '13. What's kind of your sense on what's going on there?","Mark B. Templeton","Well, I think Europe has been in a fairly stable pattern for the last few quarters now, and people are becoming more adjusted to the expectations, how to work with customers, how to think about backlog and the timing of getting individual transactions closed. And so we've done a lot of work across EMEA both in terms of our teams, where we've been very focused on it, and the fact that we're just, like I said, more comfortable working in this type of environment. So it's going to be -- it will continue to be volatile in certain periods of time. I think that's an appropriate assumption. However, the -- let's call it the degree of uncertainty in the economic environment across the world has probably come down a little bit and should in 2013 because many of the unknown events are known events, and that helps a lot. Because even if it's a somewhat negative outcome, you know how to plan for it and that's a big deal for customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, are you still expecting $15 million for Bytemobile next year, and how much should we expect or is it built in for Zenprise? That's one question, and I have a follow-up.","David James Henshall","Sure, Michael. Let me -- I said in my earlier remarks that we expect the mobile platform business to be about $30 million of revenue in 2013, and we'll be delivering that product both in -- for those different solutions both in perpetual license form, as well as in a more ratable SaaS-type model. And so obviously, the mix will determine the exact amount of revenue, but plan on about $30 million for right now. As far as Byte, we had said last quarter that we'd expect it to contribute about $50 million in 2013 and will likely be ahead of that if we continue to see the success that we've had. But I think it will be somewhat uneven due to occasional large deals coming in, but certainly up and to the right. So we don't plan on breaking that out with a whole lot of granularity going forward simply because it is becoming more and more integrated with the broader NetScaler motion. So we'll give more qualitative comments in each quarter's results, but don't plan on guiding to that as an individual line item.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then if I could just get one more little less quantitative. In the NetScaler business, outside of your traditional areas of strength there with cloud service providers and in attach to Desktop, are you making -- what kind -- how would you describe your progress in the just the -- let's call this the stand-alone load balance market where you might go more directly against [indiscernible]?","David James Henshall","Well, I think just in general when we think about NetScaler, we're doing extremely well across the board. When we talk about specific initiatives for cross-sell and attached sell, I mean the attached is obviously just -- when you're looking at Networking and Desktop as an integrated solution and the things that we can kind of uniquely deliver there to customers. On the cross sell motion, that's more about just competing in a broad enterprise account for either related projects or in just core networking opportunities. And so the broader coverage we have, the more partnerships we have, the breadth of products that we've been delivering over the last many quarters have really helped out on that front. In general, the enterprise is certainly by far the fastest-growing part of the business in Q4 results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It looks like in the past 2 quarters, the non-Desktop Solutions business has been accelerating, and although a lot of people still think of Citrix on Wall Street at least as a, say, desktop virtualization company, the reality is that you guys are becoming more and more diversified. I guess where I'm going with this is that as a management team, where are the areas of investment as you look into 2013? Basically, the guidance, it feels like you're not expecting much of a turn in the Desktop Solutions business. But should we be giving up those wonderful growth rates of 15%, 20%, whatever that you did about a couple of years back? Or do you think that there is enough of an investment cycle that's going on and maybe certain internal factors specific to the industry, the cost of the virtualization starts needs to come down storage network and technology? Do you think there's a chance of that business coming back up into 2013 and surprising you, or is it going to be more of looking for the networking, the mobile and the cloud businesses really pick up the growth trend here? That's it for me.","Mark B. Templeton","Okay. Maybe I'll lead the discussion a little bit and then David can maybe add some more data to it. But I think the way we think about this as a management team is we're in the mobile work styles' business and what we're doing is offering the right mix of cloud computing infrastructure to actually enable mobile work styles. And if that requires a mix of SaaS and Premise and Windows or native mobile or whatever mix is required to do that and to really be the company that stands for that and delivers that in the marketplace, then that's what we do. And I think if you look at the last -- if you look back in, I suppose, 2004, we were 100% about virtualizing Windows apps and desktops. Last year, as to keep the numbers round and easy, I think 60% and 20% around the collaboration and data sharing and 20% around cloud networking and platforms. So -- and that's been a very natural evolution based upon our overall vision and goal to emerge as the company that delivers on the mobile work style promise in the context of how we define this with device, network, location, et cetera, independence, okay? So that's how we think about the business and how we're driving the growth. And then any particular segment then will have its own strategy, and we're obviously looking at all of those individually around share, share gains and what we do in each of the granular pieces as well.","David James Henshall","Yes. And, Kash, I'd just add that similar to what Mark said, it's hard to lump the business into one category. It's -- we're occasionally described as a virtualization company, which is interesting. But from our point of view, we're participating in a number of very different discrete markets that have different growth rates, like cloud networking, cloud platforms, mobile platforms, desktop virtualization and others and the strategy of bringing the unique technologies across some of these different areas to solve real problems for customers and doing it in a highly differentiated way that starts with a customer out point of view. And that's really been our focus. And one of the reasons why when we talk about the business, we do tend to talk about it in more aggregated terms because frankly, that's how we plan, that's how we think about it strategically and that's how we go to market.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. That's a great explanation. If you could very quickly talk about what percentage of the sales force, David and Mark, is trained to sell the complete holistic solution and where do you see that going in the future?","David James Henshall","100% of the sales force is trained to talk to our overall strategy as a company and positioning around mobile work style. And then we have overlay groups that focus on various segments in terms of products, as well as market segments in terms of customers that then work with our ERMs that are leading the conversation, let's say, with enterprise-type accounts. So everyone tells the entire story, and then we'll have tiers of various specialist teams that actually can sell networking or sell a CloudPlatform solution or sell a collaboration or a data sharing solution. So -- and the same thing goes for mobility. And that's how we can leverage the base and leverage the brand and as well as to execute because it's really hard for teams to actually have the capability to sell multiples of things all the way through a sales cycle. So specialists are an important part of how our formula for doing this and how we've been able to grow the company around multiple products and multiple routes to market and serving multiple types of customers, for prosumers at one end through small business, through enterprise and service providers at the other end.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up from a prior question. I'm wondering if you could give us some additional insight into your incremental go-to-market investments that you plan to make around networking and also with the mobile carriers in 2013?","David James Henshall","Sure, Gregg. Basically, it's in go-to-market coverage. These are -- it's one of the areas that tends to require a little bit more specialization from a go-to-market standpoint, and we need to hire up those unique skill sets. There are a number of markets that we're just frankly not covering or were underrepresented. And so the more we can bring this capacity to market, the faster we will be able to grow that business and serve customers.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then it sounds, Mark, as though customer interest and adoption on CloudStack or CloudPlatform is picking up. How do you expect this to sort of play out in 2013? And also was curious if you had any comments on relative positioning vis-\u00e0-vis OpenStack?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Gregg. So our strategy investment there, you have to think of it as a multiyear program where we're in the front end, where design wins matter. And that's been the focus. Design wins in both service provider as well as enterprise segments, as these 2 types of customers build what we like to think of as anything as a service platforms that abstract away storage, compute and network. So the focus has been on getting those design wins. And as I've mentioned in the comments, we saw a continued traction with telcos, with service providers, with educational institutions and with what I'd like to think of as the enlightened enterprise, those that are thinking in the post-server virtualization world context. So that's the -- that's what we've been focused on, and the scorecard is really good. And so we like what we're doing there. Additionally, what happens this year is as we then bring the Merlin release of Avalon out, that will really enable CloudPlatform to sit underneath our Desktop Virtualization products like XenApp and XenDesktop. And we'll be able to offer to those same types of customers the Windows-as-a-Service capability that David mentioned, and that will give us additional leverage and additional solutions and revenue from those types of customers. So this is a multiyear investment that we're making on the bet that customers move beyond sort of the server virtualization, sort of notion of data center to actually more of anything-as-a-service type platform that you build in a very, very different way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mark, you mentioned you had some nice early wins in the Cisco relationship. I wonder if you could kind of characterize that. What sort of customers are interested and how might that change as the relationship continues to grow?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, we had a couple of -- actually, the top 2 deals were with financial services companies and not bolts bracket, but known brands. And they were -- one was over 7 figures, one was approaching 7. Then a handful sort of in the mid-range in terms of size. And that's really early, Matt, because we made the announcement in Barcelona in October. And so if you think about sort of mid-October announcement and then kind of the end of the year process whether it's kind of holidays or traditional end of your close process, getting that much done that quickly actually gives us really good optimism for what's possible here, working together. And that's just on a reference and a recommendation sell. What's ahead is tighter integration on -- from a technology perspective where customers will see great leverage working with Cisco and Citrix in this area moving from the load balancing world, which we really don't like to compete in because it's a commodity role and moving into the -- at the app delivery controller and the application-defined network space. So that's really where our focus is here and certainly, working really technically in conjunction with Cisco.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's great. And then maybe a quick one for David. There's been a couple of questions with headcount. According to my math, it looks like headcount this year was up about 17%, which was pretty close to the revenue growth rate. Is that a safe assumption to use for next year's sort of headcount growing kind of in line with revenue?","David James Henshall","At this point, I think that we'd probably be using 1,000 people as a safe number, and then that's just a function of consumption. We'll be investing all the areas that we've talked about across the business. And then as the year progresses, depending on market conditions, we dial that up and -- or dial that down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Fishbein with Lazard Capital Markets.","Joel P. Fishbein - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the Amazon relationship with NetScaler and CloudBridge. If you can just give us any color on that and see if you're getting any traction there, that would be helpful.","Mark B. Templeton","Joe, so I think everyone probably knows we just announced that capability in Q4 where NetScaler went on the AWS marketplace and we're one of the early product on the marketplace. And I mean the growth is great, but it's off of a 0 base. And I think what's ahead there is just the possibilities of promoting and selling more of an e-commerce and online way through the Amazon demand generation channels. We participated in their conference and with a standing-room-only crowd in our breakout. So lots of enthusiasm for NetScaler on that platform because it does actually help app developers with global scale, reliability, performance, and security. And those are all important things when you're building a cloud service anywhere including -- especially on Amazon. So we like what's happening early on, and yes, there's more -- lots more to do there to drive consumption of it.","Ian Song - International Data Corporation","Just to follow up, that was what I was trying to get to. So should we think of it as just an extension of a channel or could there be more to it in terms of deeper strategy?","David James Henshall","I think the way to think about it is a channel, and we've seen the incredible growth of NetScaler VPX, the virtual appliance version of NetScaler. And this is really a channel for delivering that to the AWS customer base. And then, obviously, as we do more and more with Amazon and certainly, we'd like to do more in the area of virtual desktops and apps and mobility and so forth, this component will be an important piece of an overall framework that customers will be able to use. Just like where David talked about the multi-profit customers and the number of customers that are buying a solution from us that includes multiple of our components, the same thing will go for our relationship on Amazon, but that's in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Buttigieg with Longbow Research.","Kevin M. Buttigieg - Longbow Research LLC","Just back to the Desktop business for a minute. Just wondering if you could characterize kind of the -- where the cycle is in terms of new customers versus upgrade customers. And with Avalon coming out at the end of the year, do you see that as having particular appeal towards either one of those 2 groups?","David James Henshall","Yes, Kevin, it's David. In terms of like new customers versus customers that are upgrading from an app virtualization solution, I mean the ratio is greater than 80-20. And that's really -- the upgrade motion was a little bit more of a 2011, maybe early 2012 story. So when we talk about this business, it's really largely for new customers and new license. A couple of interesting stats around that, that I've looked at recently, and that is when you look at the type of mix of the different versions and alternatives the customers have, we've seen a continued shift towards the platinum version of the product as customers are looking more and more at solving different problems depending upon the individual use cases, different user populations, et cetera. It's not a conversation about VDI, and that's probably a big misconception in the marketplace. And within the platinum version obviously giving you that full breadth of FlexCast delivery technology that's unique in the market, and that's helped to drive ASPs up a little bit too. So ASPs were actually up, believe it or not, 25% year-on-year. And again, the units move around depending on the versions. So as we think about this, we're having more strategic conversations. We're attacking more important business issues. And then with kind of new things coming out this year that we talked about a few times, it's focused on just making it easier, making it easier for customers to adopt, scale and manage, and that's why I think it'll apply to both existing customers but probably really open up that group that have found traditional desktop virtualization just too complex or too hard at this point in time. So it's early, but we're very excited about the opportunity.","Operator","Our next question is Macmillan Ross with Citrix.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Ross Macmillan from Jefferies. I have 2 questions, the first on the networking business. I think in Q3, your license growth was obviously a little bit slower than normal. And I was curious as to whether any of the strength in Q4 was just a timing issue between deals that fell into Q3, or didn't fall in Q3 but fell in Q4 instead, and specifically I guess, around your typical e-commerce type customers that would typically buy in Q3.","David James Henshall","Sure, Ross. It's David. As far as Q3 and Q4. I mean there's always a few deals that slide between quarters, but I can't think of anything specific that is really of anything really large scale that moved from Q3 to Q4. I think the more pronounced issue was the year-over-year comps. Q3 2011 was just a monster quarter for NetScaler, I believe, up about 50% as there were some pretty public cloud services build-outs going on around that time. We participated well with that. They just weren't as many in Q3 2012. So the biggest volatility point last quarter was around e-com, or dot-com\/cloud service providers. But overall, the big, big driver which I mentioned a couple of times in Q4 was the enterprise, even significantly more so than any of the other categories.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's great, that's helpful. And then just another one for you David on the sequential increase in deferred. You're obviously getting a benefit of the multiyear SA, but I wasn't clear as to whether you're also actually signing more deals that are including a higher percentage of some sort of ratable licensing element. Could you just maybe go into that and help us understand if there's any of that increase as a reflection of that latter reason?","David James Henshall","Ross, the majority of growth in deferred revenue continues to be around license updates, maintenance agreements and support agreements. There is some growth in Software-as-a-Service, longer term contracts, but the majority of our individual customer transactions are not ratable in terms of new license. They tend to be more perpetual-based with the multiple years of some level of update or maintenance.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Could I just squeeze one last one in for Mark? As we think forward toward Avalon Merlin and we think about Windows-as-a-Service, are we at a stage now today that the Windows licensing from Microsoft is amenable to this Windows-as-a-Service model? Or do you think we still need to work through some changes on Windows licensing from Microsoft before this becomes a real viable option for companies?","Mark B. Templeton","Ross, I'd say that for technologies like XenApp, I think all the licensing possibilities are in place already both for enterprises and for service providers. I think when it comes to more VDI like-solutions, that would come with a product like XenDesktop. I think that's where the life -- there's more work to do on licensing and to make that much easier for customers. The way it works today is you can actually do any of these things with Microsoft licensing as long as you bring your own licenses. But as soon as a service provider wants to offer this kind of capability proactively, then I think that's where -- there are some -- in use cases, there are some licensing changes that we would like to see, I think Microsoft would like to see as well. So we're obviously close partners with Microsoft, one of the conversations that is ongoing with them to try to drive growth in this marketplace as more and more customers want to make Windows much more of a service to support what's happening around mobility and device heterogeneity and all the things that we talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.","Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","So with your acquisitions, you're entering 2 really hyper-growth markets, which is great: the online collaboration and mobile device management. But each of those markets has got a private vendor or 2 who has been gaining tremendous share over the last couple of years. So I'm just wondering how you compete with the likes of Box on one hand and how do you compete with the likes of MobileIron and AirWatch on the other?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Pat. So the answer is we compete very, very well. And the way you compete well is to make sure you differentiate in the marketplace and play to your strengths and competencies. And so when it comes to private vendors, the examples that you gave, we will tend to go to market with our strengths and that is understanding enterprise requirements, having top-down relationships, having relationships through great partners that are SIs, whether they are like HP, IBM, CSC and others. So we'll leverage all of those tools that we have. And then obviously, we have a tremendous amount of partner coverage around the world, a huge competency of ours. So whether it's our platinum, gold or silver partners around the world, we'll reach through them as well, so using all the levers that we have. And then obviously, a key piece of competing is in product innovation. And we're -- we go head to head there in many of the innovation areas we like what we -- where we are in the roadmap and the core IP. But one of the differentiators that we have is actually integrating these things together, so that when you buy more than one product from Citrix, you start to get a 1 plus 1 equals 3 kind of outcome. And you'll -- you see that in, for example, in Barcelona, we announced something called Citrix @WorkMail, which is our iOS and Android SecureMail app, and it comes with beautiful integration with ShareFile, with GoToMeeting. And so it really makes the experience of being mobile on these devices when it comes to communications very, very easy, et cetera. And when you compare that to private company that has only one solution, they don't have the kind -- they can't offer the kind of user experience. And in the long term here, I think that whether it's consumer markets or enterprise markets, more and more of the competitions and lines of competitions are drawn on user and customer experience because it's one of the effects of consumerization. So that's how we'll compete, and we're doing really well, by the way.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Nice headlines here, guys. David, I have a question about the more strategic engagements with customers that are signing multiyear contracts and apparently paying multi-years upfront. And I guess, just 2 questions, how is that going to affect future cash flow if you're pulling in multi-years of maintenance upfront? And then secondly, we -- there's a lot of companies that sign multiyear deals for maintenance deals, but customers typically pay annually still in those deals. I assume to get the upfront payment, you have to entice them to do that. I mean why would -- I guess, can you kind of walk us through that and then just explain why you would do that?","David James Henshall","Sure, John. I mean really what we're doing is what the customer wants in most cases. As I've said many times over the years, we've never taken the approach of trying to drive like ELA style agreements and really focused on delivering what a customer needs in real-time. And then there's the budget issue or whether it's just them really wanting to lock something in over a period of time. We're providing no artificial incentives to drive this type of business. And it's still frankly is the minority of our transactions, and even the minority of large transactions. And so when I reference at them, I'm referencing the growth in long-term deferred, which is certainly influenced by this. So in that context, when you look at our total deferred revenue balance, long term only represents 19%. So it's a much smaller base, and that's one of the reasons why the growth rate is as high as it is. In terms of overall cash flow, I mean our cash flows have been certainly very strong over the last 4 quarters where we delivered nearly $820 million in cash flow from ops, which is up 21% year-on-year. While we don't guide the cash flow in forward quarters, I think it's certainly our expectation that we'll be able to continue to grow cash flow faster than net income, and that's the way we think about it. So I hope that helps.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, it does. But I guess, a quick follow-up to what you said. When customers come in and your -- I understand you want to satisfy the customers. But when they come in, do they say, \"Hey, listen. We want to sign a multiyear deal and we want to pay it all upfront. And we wanted -- in order to do that, we want an extra, I don't know, 10% discount or something.\" Is that how the discussion goes or the just say, \"Listen, we just want -- we got cash that's burning a hole in our pocket, and we just want to pay you 3 years upfront instead of 2 -- instead of 1 year for maintenance\"?","David James Henshall","John, there's no one way the conversations happen. I will say that from a -- when you think about incentives and why customers move one way or the other, we actually don't pay our field organization on these out years of a subscription advantage or software maintenance when they come in. So there's certainly no incentive there for anyone to really drive that business. Again, it's just customer-focused. And if a customer is looking to give us cash upfront and support them for the next 2 or 3 years, we're certainly going to take it. I mean that's just a good piece of business, and it also allows us to, I wouldn't say lock in the customer for that period of time. But in effect, if that's what you do, you're talking about more infrastructure led sales. They tend to be more strategic, they tend to be stickier from a competitive dynamic. And so that's what drives that. There are other customers, of course, that are looking at locking in multiple years of whatever and then we'll bill that on an annual basis or whatever is part of the contractual arrangement. And in that case, we're not even going to talk about it. We won't show up anywhere because we don't refer to off balance sheet backlog for example. I mean this is just -- it's not a big part of our business. So again, minority of the business, and that's the way -- hopefully, again that helps out -- helps you think about it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted -- end of the allotted time for questions and answers.

I will now introduce Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Fleites, you may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites","Thank you, Heather. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be Mark Templeton, President and Chief Executive Officer and David Henshall, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.","This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems' Investor Relations website. The webcast will be posted immediately following the call. Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specifications and historical revenue trends related to our product grouping to our Investor Relations website. I would like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Securities Law.

David?","David Henshall","Thank you, Eduardo and welcome to everyone joining us today. Before I discuss our Q4 and 2014 results, I would like to briefly highlight the restructuring program that we announced today. Over the last few months, we've simplified our software-defined workplace strategy, a unique perspective and approach that's resonating well with customers and partners. Internally this is driving organizational realignment, clarity and focus.","In addition, the actions announced today will drive operational efficiency while enabling continued investments in the areas that will power long term growth, like mobility, cloud services and networking. This restructuring will include the elimination of approximately 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions worldwide and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. We anticipate that the company will incur a pretax charge in the range of $50 million to $55 million in connection with this restructuring. And all in, these changes are expected to result in annualized pretax savings of $90 million to $100 million.","As I outlined on our prior earnings calls, we're committed to increasing our operational efficiency in 2015 including the continued rationalization of our product portfolio consistent with our stated strategy. So now let's review the specific results from Q4. As you can see from the release, total revenue increased 6% year-on-year to $851 million. We generated cash flow from operations of over $190 million, adjusted EPS increased 6% to $1.10 per share and deferred revenue was up $154 million sequentially or 10% year-on-year.","In Q4 we closed a record 90, $1 million plus transactions. About half of these deals came in the workplace services business including 13 that were for the Workspace Suite, our newly launched solution that unites mobility, app virtualization and secure data all in a single package. Geographically the EMEA results were negatively impacted by currency as well as some softness in Eastern Europe, but despite these issues, total revenues still increased 7% including 38, $1 million dollar plus transactions. Within the Americas total revenue was up 4% and the teams closed 48 large transactions and finally in APAC, revenue grew 5% with some uneven demand conditions seen in both China and Japan during the quarter.","Next let's briefly look at Q4 results within our three primary businesses. First, Workspace Services grew 2% to $437 million. As discussed last year, we've been driving a broader conversation with customers about transforming the delivery of IT services to enable mobile work styles, securely and efficiently. Mobility has been the primary catalyst, plus the need for customers is to take a holistic approach to solving these problems. This strategy is what drove the creation of the Workspace Suite offering in the middle of last year.","In Q4 we saw significant uptake of the Suite from both new and existing customers. And while contributing about 15% of Workspace Services license revenue, it also drove the majority of growth in our long term deferred revenue as many customers chose to enter into multiyear arrangements. We do expect contribution from the Suite to continue to grow into 2015 which will gradually lead to a higher percentage of revenue being deferred.","Also in the Workspace Services area is our Service Provider business. This subscription-based program is growing nearly 50% year-over-year, a pace that we expect to continue into 2015. So we're delivering a complete mobility solution allowing customers of all sizes to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobile, on premise or service based and doing it all with a customer centric experience that only Citrix can provide.","Next in the delivery networking business, total revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $195 million. The NetScaler products were again the major driver of this business, showing strong growth within the enterprise customers which now represent about 2\/3rds of total sales.","For more context, let me touch on a few metrics from Q4. First, product integration initiatives led to over 700 virtualization orders that included networking as part of the overall solution. This is roughly a 10% attach rate which is an increase in contribution over a year ago. We transacted with over 2600 customers in the period compared to about 2300 last year as we continue to expand the base of both new and cross-sell.","And from a mix perspective the NetScaler FPS platform has been growing the fastest, up more than 25% year-on-year in Q4 and now representing 19% of the overall NetScaler mix. We continue to drive innovation in the data center with our unique technologies across both physical and software-defined networking platforms, powering some of the world's largest clouds and giving enterprises the capabilities to combine best in class app networking services on a single consolidated footprint.","And finally, revenue from our SaaS delivered mobility apps grew 10% to $168 million. Our communications cloud remains the largest part of this business, contributing 60% of the mix and growing 10%. Our secure data platform, ShareFile continues to expand rapidly, up 60% year-on-year and now surpassing 50,000 customers and over 10 million individual users. The majority of this growth is coming across document centric verticals, enterprise customers and the tight integration that we've built with our mobile and virtualization solutions.","Turning to operations, adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 85%, down about 0.5% sequentially and while margins will continue to reflect the mix of revenue, we expect this trend to level off into 2015. Adjusted operating margin was 26% in Q4 and cash flow from operations was $190 million for the quarter and $850 million for the trailing 12 months. This is approximately $5 per share.","On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter, up primarily due to cash flow from ops. Deferred revenue increased $154 million sequentially to $1.56 billion including $40 million growth in long term deferred. As I mentioned earlier, this reflects strong renewal rates for our subscription advantage offerings, the continued migration of our install base to more holistic maintenance contracts and the increased volume of multiyear customer arrangements generally associated with the Workspace Suite.","And finally, as we discussed earlier last year, we're working to optimize our cap structure and programmatically return capital to shareholders. In Q4 we repurchased $3.3 million of our shares which is the remaining balance from our 2014 ASR program and some additional open-market repurchase. This leaves about $290 million remaining under the current buyback program.","Turning to our current outlook and expectations for Q1 and 2015, I would like to first provide some context around our guidance. In the first half, we'll continue to optimize the business model, streamlining the organization, initiating a multiyear expansion of margins and increasing focus on our core growth markets. Our guidance accounts for some potential impacts executions stemming from the restructuring, modest headwinds from foreign currency and a slightly higher deferral rate on new customer bookings. From a strategic perspective we'll be investing in the emerging high-growth businesses as well as future initiatives like the workspace cloud.","So for 2015, our expectations are for total revenue in the range of $3.29 billion to $3.33 billion, adjusted operating margin to show improvement of more than 100 basis points, a tax rate of 23% and adjusted EPS of between $3.60 and $3.65 per share. For Q1, 2015 our expectations are for total revenue growth in the range of $780 million to $790 million, tax rate of 23% and adjusted EPS of between $0.70 and $0.72 a share.","So now I would like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details around our reorganization and on the quarter's ongoing businesses. Mark?","Mark Templeton","Thanks, David and good afternoon, everyone. I'm proud of how we addressed market, transitional and competitive challenges in 2014, but I'm not satisfied. From here, we're looking ahead to 2015 with a focus on innovation that delivers a better experience, more flexibility and greater security to our customers, working from a more focused organizational footprint that enables profitable growth.","So today I would like to talk about our strategy, structuring for success, expanding our leadership strength and how we're building momentum for 2015. For the past 26 years, Citrix has been a visionary in software defining the workplace, guided by our core belief that work is not a place. A software defined workplace is one where people can securely and effortlessly collaborate across the boundaries of time, place and devices. They create better business outcomes, they're more productive and engaged and their businesses are more agile and responsive to change. We've positioned, scaled and transformed Citrix through significant growth phases from remote access to web app delivery to virtualization to mobile workspaces, and now we're doing it again.","We hear every day from customers about the dual pressures they face to deliver business results while creating an engaging work life experience for people. Our focus on enabling a software-defined workplace is putting Citrix in front of this strategic challenge through the unique integration of our delivery networking, Workspace Services and mobility apps.","In the design world, form follows function. Similarly, in business, organization follows strategy. So we're restructuring to allow us to better reflect our strategy in our organizational model to refocus our investments on our highest growth opportunities and to streamline decision-making. We'll also improve our overall efficiency, helping us to continue our positive financial growth and expand our operating margin. I think we all know it's extremely difficult to make a restructuring decision like this. Understanding how challenging it will be for those employees whose roles are affected.","At the same time, these changes are necessary to deliver on the promise of our software-defined workplace strategy. As you've also seen over the past six weeks, we're strengthening our leadership team with recent appointments of Carlos Sartorius as our Senior Vice President for Worldwide Sales and Services, Robson Grieve as our Senior Vice President for Marketing and Geir Ramleth as our Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","These seasoned executives bring strong track records, global experience and the additional leadership talent we need to operationalize, execute and drive our business. Carlos has done a remarkable job getting our EMEA business back on track and in his career; he has successfully led teams in every geography in the world. This makes him a great fit for this expanded roll.","As the former CIO of Bechtel, Geir led an epic transformation of IT. It's been called actually the Googleization of Bechtel. Geir brings a customer-centric perspective, incredible industry relationships and deep technical knowledge that will help accelerate our software-defined workplace strategy. And most recently, Robson was Executive Vice President of Global Marketing and Customer Experience with Concur, now an SAP company.","As an experienced cloud services marketing leader, Robson brings a wealth of experience and talent to Citrix. His background of brand, communications and digital marketing will be instrumental toward communicating our compelling story and significant value proposition to customers.","I'm also very excited about our increased pace of innovation, both organic and acquired, especially what we're launching this quarter. For example, we're releasing some amazing features for XenApp that strengthen the value for our customers and expand the market opportunity for our partners and service providers. For example, in customers and engineering, manufacturing and government sectors, we're adding support for Linux-based DDI and remote apps. To add contextual security for banking, government and healthcare apps, we're releasing HDX screen recording. During our recent partner summit, this feature was highly, highly applauded.","To simplify anywhere access, we're releasing HTML five-based receivers for no download secure access from any browser and even Chromebooks and for people connecting over high packet loss networks, like WiFi, cellular and satellite, we're releasing a tech preview of HDX with integrated frame hog technology. Everyone that sees it is just amazed.","We're also excited to be releasing XenMobile 10 with a completely integrated backend that provides a single console for device security, mobile app security and app delivery operations. We expect the XenMobile 10 to further accelerate pipeline closure rates, increase general engagement and support a greater mix of Workspace Suite deals.","We often win XenApp and mobile deals based on the follow-me data capabilities of ShareFile. This quarter we're releasing ShareFile restricted zones. We believe this feature makes ShareFile the most secure cloud-based, document-sharing, syncing and task-flow service in the world and will help us drive even greater share in professional services, healthcare, government, engineering and financial services segments where both security and data sovereignty really matter.","Our recent acquisition of Sanbolic adds storage virtualization as a powerful core technology that will add exciting new capabilities across our entire product portfolio. Initially, Sanbolic brings high-performance, nonstop availability, simpler configuration and lower cost to Citrix DDI, Windows App delivery and Workspace Suite solutions.","It's also a key enabler to our WorkspacePod solution announced to our partners last week. WorkspacePod is a predefined Citrix software stack on certified hyper-converged infrastructure. It speeds time to value with breakthrough price performance for DDI solutions. Our first WorkspacePod partners include DataON and HP. The powered by HP solution leverages the hyper-converged power of HP Moonshot and provides the most flexible, best price performance platform for hosting simple DDI, all the way to graphics- intensive virtual workstations and apps.","So to wrap up, we have a clear strategy. Our vision of a software-defined workplace is resonating with our customers as they turn their attention to driving consumer-like experiences, contextual security and greater device app and location flexibility for work. We're organizing around this strategy with a stronger team, streamlined structure and an exciting pipeline of innovation. Together, this is our framework for delivering sustainable customer value and profitable growth.","And now I would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Heather Bellini","I was wondering if you could share with us your goals from the restructuring program in terms of operating margins. I'm bouncing between other calls so I apologize if you mentioned this, but I'm trying to get a sense of should we expect all of this to flow through to the bottom line which by our math, gets to about a 300 basis point improvement in operating margins? And I know, David, last quarter you had chatted a little bit about having a multiyear margin view. I'm just wondering if there is anything you could share with us about how you think about your operating margin goals as we exit this restructuring?","David Henshall","Sure, Heather. Let me talk a little bit more broadly about the restructuring and then touch on longer-term margins. At a high level, the restructuring it's combination of everything from simple delayering across the board, impacting [inaudible] areas in the field organization, development in certain non-core products and others. It will also allow us to continue to drive investment into our mobile apps business, like data sharing, collaboration and works, development areas like mobility, networking and workspace cloud; and go-to-market areas like NetScaler and mobile where we're still capacity constrained in a number of areas.","So the simple message around the restructuring is let the strategy drive a simplified organizational structure which in turn allows for more focused and streamlined operations and the outcome as I mentioned, some of these changes allowing us to drive $90 million or $100 million in annualized savings. Our guidance right now is for operating margins to expand more than 100 basis points this year, but begin the process of getting back to north of 25% operating margin over the next couple of years. And so that is the longer-term approach and the way to think about it. We're viewing this as step one in a multiyear expansion of margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is open. ","John DiFucci","My follow-up question, David is on that margin thing, that's something that I think a lot of investors, I'm sure are talking to you about, they're talking to us about and it just seems like the 100 basis points next year, seems like it -- Heather threw out 300 basis points in her question. It seems like you can get a lot more out of that especially in the sales and marketing area. Can you touch on that? Like why you wouldn't especially now that you have the restructuring ready to go forward, why you wouldn't try to get a little more on the margin side there?","David Henshall","Sure, John. Net-net at a high level, the way to think about guidance is a couple of things and it is the 5% or 6% growth in revenue is roughly what we saw in the second half of the year. We feel like it's a right expectation going into the start of this year. It includes some assumption of continued softness around markets like Russia, China and Japan. Some modest FX impact particularly in our SaaS-related businesses where we priced a lot in local currency, and then a slight increase in the aggregate deferral rates due to the strength of Suite focused on software service providers and multiyear arrangements.","And so from a margin perspective, the guidance as I mentioned before is greater than 100 basis points and I think that's where we would like to start at the beginning of the year and we certainly have opportunities to continue to optimize the model as well as drive upside from revenue growth. And so again, it's a step one of a multiyear approach to margins. We expect to be able to grow this year and as I said a minute ago, get back to north of 25% in the next couple years.","John DiFucci","And if I could, just one quick follow-up, you mentioned foreign exchange impact to the EMEA business. Could you remind us -- I thought that most of your sales were in U.S. dollars even internationally. Could you remind us how the foreign exchange impact -- how you're having that kind of impact?","David Henshall","Sure, John. It's really twofold. On a direct basis we do sell a number of things in local currency. All of our SaaS business internationally is local and some portion of our other businesses. So the net impact is probably no more than $10 million or so in 2015, but it's material enough that we wanted to point that out. The indirect impact is what we hear from customers and partners that have looked at changes in this [inaudible] strengthening of the dollar as something that has caused an indirect delay or a shrinking of the size of certain transactions. So it's really the indirect one that is harder to quantify. So we're just calling out the direct sales piece.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Karl Keirstead","I wouldn't mind asking a question around the restructuring, the 700 full-time and 200 contractor. Could you add a little bit more specificity around what product area they might be coming out of or functional area? Thank you.","David Henshall","Karl, I would rather actually not go into lot of detail at this point in time. We're still going through notification process around that. I would say that it's consistent with the strategy that we have talked about to focus on core product areas to focus on improving leverage in the field organization and in just general delayering across the organization. So I would rather keep it at that level for right now.","Karl Keirstead","Okay. Maybe I can get a follow-up then if you don't mind, if I could ask about the desktop growth of about 2%? Do you think we're approaching the point where that desktop growth is hitting the bottom and we could begin to have some acceleration in 2015 whether because of XenApp 7.6 or some other catalyst? Maybe a little color on the desktop growth trajectory? Thank you.","David Henshall","Sure, Carl. There is probably two pieces there that we should talk about. First one is that the dynamics we saw in Q4 were actually pointing to a stronger underlying environment than the reported numbers and the big difference there is around deferred revenue. So if you add that back in you'll see a bookings number that is the highest we had all year and really that was coming out of the mobile and desktop, what we call the Workspace Services business.","In particular, the growth in the Workspace Suite and just a reminder, that is the combination of mobile virtualization and data in one holistic package. We had great performance there. In fact, up more than 200% sequentially and really driving a lot of strategic conversations. The way that that's showing up in the numbers is just to net it out, an average transaction historically would be about 25% deferred.","For the Workspace Suite in Q4, that was more than 50% deferred and it's just a combination of the way they're structured, customers opting for multiyear arrangements, etcetera. So that's kind of the one dynamic that I would point out. I would say overall we're happy with the direction we see things going. Some of the things that Mark mentioned around XenApp, new use cases that we're driving for the broader products, continued expectation around growth of the Suite. Obviously the standalone XenMobile business is continuing to do well and so you put all those things together and do feel like that we're -- not sure if I would call it bottomed out. That sounds too negative, but certainly optimistic about the trajectory of that business going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is open. ","James Wesman","It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Could you just provide some color on your sales strategy going into 2015 since the partner summit earlier this month, maybe some of the changes you guys have made versus 2014?","David Henshall","Sure, James. Let me talk high-level about sales organization. We're in the middle of a sales transformation that began last year and we had a phased rollout across all geographies. The overall goal around the field changes is to increase execution consistency and coverage in areas that will allow us to bring down overall cost of sales and so in the U.S., field restructuring has had really two big objectives.","One is a clearer definition and consistency about the way we're aligning resources to maximize performance in each individual market and then to establish focus around really specific segments versus geographical territories. In EMEA, I would say that we start implementing last year around coverage in go-to-market model for each of the top countries that we serve and really the idea was segmenting countries into four distinct archetypes, core, established, growth and emerging and then putting the structure in place within each of these types to provide the right coverage of the market really in the way that we want to address that.","So broadly about engaging the channel around commercial, laying Citrix drive directly around enterprise and increasing focus on service providers. That's the three big areas that I would point out.","Mark Templeton","James, the thing that I would add is that we're doing a lot of work to make the product lines much more partner friendly when it comes to partners that are beyond our platinum partners. And when you see things like WorkspacePod, for example when you see us with XenMobile 10, where the backend is much simpler, these become platforms for value-add for partners that I think have been less engaged as the overall complexity of the solutions has grown.","And so as introduction of WorkspacePod really makes the time to value much shorter for the customer, it also makes it much easier for partners to implement and much easier for them to then drive services that connect that WorkspacePod and all the services that provides to a customer's specific business. So we're doing quite a few things on that side to revitalize any of the partners that have been so loyal for so long.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is open. ","Rick Sherlund","I missed the very beginning of the call, but it looks to me like the benefit you're going to get from the cost-cutting is, if I'm correct around $0.50 and I'm not sure how much of that flows into the year, but the guidance on earnings I'm kind of puzzled by because it looks like that's about where the Street was, maybe even a little bit lower but with the benefits of the cost savings I would have thought that earnings number would have gone up. What am I missing?","David Henshall","Rick, we talked about the context around guidance and I'm sure you can go back and see that in the transcript. And some of the things that we're doing for revenue guidance and the areas that I think we're being conservative on that approach. We had talked a little bit more about the growth in margins that we're seeing both in this year and our approach to a multiyear to get back north of 25. I would say overall outcomes of the restructuring will allow us to grow expenses significantly slower than revenue growth in 2015 without sacrificing the necessary focus on those parts of the business that are going to provide long term sustainable growth. So broad rebalancing, increase in margins and you'll see EPS growing roughly double the rate of revenue growth next year.","Rick Sherlund","Okay. And should I think about the cost cuts taking place at the beginning of the year or is it over the year? How much of that $90 million to $100 million is actually realized in the year?","David Henshall","Yes, that's an annualized number. I'd say at a high level, impacted employees in the U.S. will be notified shortly. Internationally it will be in accordance with local law and regulations. The facilities changes and closures will come over the next couple of quarters and then other things that we've talked about around the portfolio will be addressed over the next couple of quarters as well.","Rick Sherlund","And there's nothing here that's going to affect the sales force productivity right? No structural changes in the sales organization? I think I heard you something say about not impacting -- it's all non-quota salespeople?","David Henshall","Yes, to a large degree. I think that in our guidance for Q1, we of course do anticipate the potential for some impact of the overall restructuring to the organization. Want to just be thoughtful and conservative around that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. ","Steve Ashley","I would just like to drill down a little bit on the Workspace Services Suite and how and what impact selling that in terms of you had mentioned it's more of a strategic discussion. How does it impact the go to market of the direct sales force? How does it impact the role of the channel selling that? What do they do differently in terms of selling it and a little color on that would be great.","Mark Templeton","Steve, I would say first of all, Workspace Suite definitely performed extremely well and it performed extremely well in two places. First where we have named accounts and there is very much direct [inaudible] on our part. So it's Citrix lead partners supported, and these are accounts that were down the road, with strategic infrastructure and they are getting to the mobility part of their overall infrastructure decision and that decision is going our way based upon the differentiators we have with ShareFile and our mobility apps on one side and the integration with our delivery networking on the other side.","Then the other piece of it is our platinum partners when it comes to middle-market customers, are quite adept at selling multiple products. They are required actually to be a platinum partner to have all these certifications. So we saw a number of them step up to sell the Workspace Suite in Q4, and really an extension of the strategic conversation that they've had with middle-market customers. I don't think we've seen the potential beyond those two sales motions at this point. And I think that what we would expect going forward is that the customers outside the direct touch or the platinum initiated middle-market customer, they will be more likely to engage through the workspace cloud which we'll talk more about at synergy and that should bring some upside to the back end of this year and obviously going into next year where we're providing a full workspace capability from Windows app delivery to mobile apps security and management, to all the data services that are integrated across the board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is open. ","Ed Maguire","I wanted to shift things up a little bit and ask about the recent acquisition of Octoblu, blue which is an IoT platform for API's and workflow. I wanted to ask about how you see that fitting into the broader portfolio and whether this is a sign that you're looking to really extend reach beyond machines that users interact with.","Mark Templeton","Okay, so first of all, small acquisition, very small. And secondly, we think the most exciting IoT platform out there. As a matter of fact, there was a recent hackathon sponsored by AT&T and a couple other high-profile sponsors where there were four prizes. Two of them were won by Octoblu team and then one of the other, the third prize was won by someone else that used the Octoblu platform.","Now what our goal is, is to use the Octoblu platform as in the form of the IoE integration of everything and to actually allow it to be a platform for our partners to generate additional value add when it comes to creating a smarter workplace. So the demonstrations that we've done, through integration with our mobility apps like GoToMeeting, ShareFile, Podio as well as Citrix Receiver and so forth are pretty impressive, allowing -- [inaudible] to trigger flows that set up meetings, that cause transcriptions to be created and distributed all automatically just based upon proximity in a conference room. That's just one example. There are many, many other examples and possibilities and the Octoblu platform actually normalizes connections not only between apps but between devices, between people, both -- and machine to machine.","So you'll see this technology embedded also in some of our products because it has the ability to gather instrumentation information, send that information off to a Big Data analytics and provide real-time predictive capabilities so that we can drive the kind of experience that no one in our space is even thinking about at this point. So it's pretty exciting. It's small. It's early and look for some excitement around it at synergy.","Ed Maguire","And just was interested to get your take at least on the Windows 10 preview so far, the concept of universal apps. How are you guys thinking about evolving your workspaces to address some of the new opportunities around what Windows 10 is bringing to the table?","Mark Templeton","Okay, a few things, first of all we'll be fully Windows 10 prepared on launch. What that means is on the client side, we'll be fully prepared and onto VDI side, we'll be fully prepared for the launch. I've been personally using Windows 10 for some time now and it's a great release of Windows and we expect that it will be important for the business market, the enterprise market. And in terms of universal apps etcetera, certainly it's one of the many solutions to app compatibility across platforms and we'll support all of these. I mean HTML 5 and it's the advancements there where I think working on the cutting edge in that sense in terms of building universal apps. We see a lot of customers going that way, and we'll be fully supporting Microsoft's initiatives as well and prepared with our own products in that context.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Philip Winslow","Congratulations on having the foresight to undertake this restructuring here but I wanted to focus on the product side, particularly XenMobile and then XenApps and desktop. You talked last quarter about getting back to par so to speak with the XenMobile 9 and then the 7.6 launches in June and September and you just alluded to the XenMobile 10 launch. How do you feel on the product side as you go into 2015, it seemed like the products that came out in the second half would have a hard time affecting the second half business but do these products that came out in the second half kind of reinforce your conviction in that turnaround that you guys talked about or at least touching bottoms bottom on those businesses and then just one quick follow-up to that?","David Henshall","Will, I think the short answer is yes. Each one of these releases has created a tipping point for certain classes of customers and certain aspects of the sales cycle. XenMobile 10 creates another tipping point, 7.6 created a tipping point. We see much more the download counts and the interest in actually migrating to 7.6 is much greater than 7.5. I didn't mention that we also this quarter are releasing additional migration tools. We'll continue on that track and help customers actually automate migration including making sure that older versions of XenApp and XenDesktop run beautifully side-by-side with the newest version, so that's a huge priority for us. ","You'll see more of that in that synergy but we have released additional capabilities for easy migration and then some of the feature releases that I mentioned in the prepared comments to bring parity, more and more parity to XenApp. And then in some cases, beyond parity which then inspires customers to want to migrate. So this has been a long road. We're intensely focused on it and we're going to drive more tipping points in 2015. Not only for the individual products, around Windows app delivery and mobile apps management, but also tipping points for the Workspace Cloud, Pod and Suites. So expect that and we're hoping to have see some impact there beginning in Q2 and the second half of the year.","Philip Winslow","And then just one follow-up on the NetScaler side, it hasn't really been talked much in Q&A it seemed like the cloud networking line had a good quarter this quarter, good growth. Wonder if you could comment on the trends you saw there and just how you think about this business heading into '15?","David Henshall","NetScaler in particular had a good quarter and it was coming from enterprise customers. We had a more than 2\/3rds of the mix coming out of the enterprise as opposed to some of the prior years where you've seen a much higher degree of reliance on the big dot-coms. Overall across the platforms I called out a couple of things in my prepared remarks. I'd say SDX continues to be the standout, that business is growing 25% plus and is now just under 20% of the overall mix and just as a reminder for everyone that is the highly virtualized platform where we can combine several dozen network services onto a single platform driving consolidation, etcetera for customers.","So that part is doing really well. Virtual appliances continue to do well. I would say in the traditional ADC market, the more generic ADC, that's a price sensitive area and units are growing faster than bookings. You've seen some price compression as we try to keep up with some of the competitors they are, but overall we're really happy with what's going on in the overall NetScaler area. We've got some good things coming in the 2015 timeframe and as well as some opportunities for potential upsides in areas like WAN virtualization which is new and more of a second half play for Citrix.","Mark Templeton","Yes, Bill, additionally and as a reminder, to everyone is that we still don't have the kind of worldwide coverage to successfully market NetScaler in areas of the world where there is great opportunity. So part of the restructuring actually shifts resources toward greater networking coverage and we'll actually see some benefit from that, we think later in the year and especially focus on the parts of the product line that provide premium value as David mentioned, SDX providing consolidation value and then there will be another major release in the year that will drive try scale in a way that will get advantage from the largest scale types of customers around the world as well and continue to work with Cisco, that partnership is very healthy and robust. I think NetScaler has the best integration with Cisco's software defined networking infrastructure and is the later 4 through 7, SDN component of choice in terms of partnering. Still early market but we're bullish around what we're doing with the Cisco team.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowan. Your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz","Earlier you mentioned briefly the rationalization of your product portfolio. I'm wondering if you could help us understand at a high level what criteria you're using to help you make those decisions? And then I just had a quick follow-up.","Mark Templeton","Greg, at a high level we're looking at things that are pretty logical. First of all, profitability and strategic context and necessity, some of the products that have small amounts of revenue that are not necessary to the strategic goals of the company, what we're doing there, we're either end-of-sailing them or they're moving from being products to being features. So one example would be our fantastic technology known as AppDNA, that is technology that allows for rapid P to V or physical to virtual conversion of Windows apps. That went from being a product to being core technology that's a feature of XenApp Platinum and XenDesktop Platinum. So there is an example there.","Another example would be VDI in a box. We're going to end-of-sale that product and it will be replaced by a simpler and more price competitive version for DDI that we have coming and so there are a number of different cases, so that would be the high-level view of how we're looking at the portfolio. And as we said, I think for the last couple calls, we're looking to actually have fewer brands where we get more wood behind fewer arrows and that means turning some products into features and the elimination of some, especially the smaller-volume products.","Gregg Moskowitz","For David, if you could tell us if XenMobile revenues ended up growing 100% or more in 2014? I think that's what you had originally anticipated at the beginning of the year. Thanks.","David Henshall","Sure, Greg. On a bookings basis, yes, the overall mobility business gets a little bit munched when you start looking at it from an external point of view and that's because we don't provide allocations externally or really talk about bookings. So if I was to maybe add up all the pieces, some of the standalones in mobile opportunities are certainly being closed as Workspace Suite now which as I've talked about a couple of times had a really big pop in Q4.","The XenMobile standalone products in Q4 growing north of 40% just on a point-product basis and then other areas like the ShareFile Data platform that's embedded in there, also growing north of 60%. So I would say all in, mobility is somewhere in the $150 million-plus area for us and growing nicely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Keith Weiss","It's Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. For fear of beating a dead horse, I'm still getting a lot of investor questions on the nature of the restructuring, because basically in our models when you guys were talking about 100 basis points of expansion FY \u201815, we were looking for basically mid-single digit revenue growth in FY \u201815 with slightly slower, almost mid-single-digit total expense growth. From your guidance it looks like we're looking for basically the same thing, a mid-single digit revenue growth with slightly lower mid-single digit expense growth, but now we have a restructuring put in place at the beginning of the year. So should we be thinking about the nature of this restructuring as more of reallocating resources or freeing up dollars to put into more productive areas or is this a restructuring to really, truly drive down total expenses?","David Henshall","Keith, at a high level it's to grow expenses significantly slower than revenue growth. So if you look at our current guidance that's out there right now, it would be 5% to 6% roughly on the topline, expense growth of roughly 4% to get to the bottom-line numbers. We did take up tax rate from most people's expectation that probably impacted by $0.10 on most models. Again that's just being conservative and that could come back down if things like the R&D tax credit get extended if normal tax audits close, but that's where the forecast is at this point in time.","We also brought revenue growth a little bit down in some of the areas we talked about, whether that is elimination of some of the standalone products that Mark called out the general motion towards more deferred and then the other areas of caution that I mentioned when I was providing context for guidance. And so you put all that together and it would show profitability going up from where most people are forecasting it right now and as I've said a couple times, we maintained the goal of more than 100 bps in op margin this year and plan to get back to 25% in a couple years.","Keith Weiss","But the bottom line is that this isn't a restructuring to lower your absolute level of expenses? This is more of targeting slower expense growth into more productive areas?","David Henshall","It's both. It's certainly about driving a reallocation of expenses towards the things that are going to drive acceleration of growth in the future and then of course, bringing absolute expenses down in some areas but in the aggregate just growing expenses much slower than revenues going forward.","Mark Templeton","If I could help a little bit just from a granularity perspective, delayering is an ongoing cost reduction. You do it one time, you get fewer layers. We get faster decision-making, but it's a cost reduction. Product eliminations or if a product moves to a feature, that gives you cost reductions because the cost of maintaining a product that's not taken to market as a product but is integrated as a feature is radically different.","So that's the cost reduction. Cost reductions that will go along with some of the facilities consolidations that David mentioned as well. So there are quite a number of these things that are institutional cost reduction and then I would say less of it is around reallocation, but where we are doing reallocation, we're reallocating where we see the opportunity and where we see the strategic aspects of the business.","So for example, greater spending on networking and field coverage and networking, greater spending on service providers and moving our service providers from a single product like XenApp or CloudPlatform to becoming workspace service providers where they're providing a full complement of products that are of higher value and create higher profit for them. It's a mix, but I would say there is a fair amount of institutional cost reduction here and then moving resources on to higher growth producing products and segments that we've had proven performance.","Keith Weiss","One follow-up, any change in how you guys are going to be approaching acquisitions? You guys have definitely looked to acquire products in the past and in the near past. Any change in that strategy on a going forward basis?","David Henshall","No change at all. I think we continue to look at technology tuck-ins that are core. So for example, Sanbolic, smaller acquisition still substantive, but it's a core technology that we monetize across product lines where we are already in the market with routes to market established, etcetera and as I mentioned, the initial approach is to use the Sanbolic technology to be much more aggressive and direct in VDI where I think we have not been very competitive, but there are lots of opportunities with Sanbolic in the core platform in the foundation for monetization in other products.","Much like XenServer, there's a new release of XenServer. It's a foundational technology and it's going to make a huge impact in XenApps and XenDesktop in terms of density which in fact, reduces costs as well as performance and especially in virtual GPU support. And obviously a better XenServer means a better NetScaler SDX with some new capabilities for SDX that will be coming as a result of that related to performance and the ability to consolidate layer four through seven delivery services even better.","So that's how to think about acquisitions in the core in the foundation and then the other way to think about them is that we look for acquisitions that have great attach rates and adjacency, especially in our mobility apps space. So for example, last quarter we acquired RightSignature. The conversions on RightSignature continue to be upwards of 35% when we do the co-marketing with ShareFile. We think there are other opportunities like that where we get synergy, but even better we get stickiness with the customer so the renewal rates are higher because we are more embedded into the customer's workflow.","And obviously because we're taking very much a vertical market approach to a number of our SMB products. We think that there is great opportunity there and obviously those same products differentiate XenMobile in terms of our Worx Apps Suite, so we get synergies both ways with acquisitions like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Jim [inaudible] for Dan Ives. Just wondering if you could talk a little about the competitive landscape and in particular just on the mobility on the NetScaler side? Thanks.","David Henshall","Sure, Jim. I would say, similar to my prior comments around networking continues to be a very competitive market as it's always been. The core ADC, simple ADC use case is price competitive and we saw ASP's come down a bit in that area. In mobile, mobile has always been a very competitive space in particular on standalone mobile opportunities. Of course we compete a lot with folks like Mobileiron and AirWatch, but overall when we look at ASPs they were roughly flat on a year-over-year and sequential basis.","So highly competitive, but we're winning based on differentiation and the approach that we've taken to reframe the conversation from a simple MDM to a much broader more strategic conversation around enterprise mobility and we can do that just because of the nature of the solution bringing together all the various components that Citrix has.","In terms of the core desktop and app virtualization area, again the consistent ASPs, not a lower change on that front. We have a fair bit of business that I've talked about multiple times here that's been moving to the higher value Workspace Suite so that's a motion that's going to continue both in terms of new customers as well as the trade-up opportunities as we target back into the installed base and that allows us to bring together again multiple technology areas and get out of the price competition and really focus on feature and breadth of differentiation that way.","Obviously growth in deferred would point to a bit better demand environment than the actual reported license numbers but overall no material changes, I would say in any markets, but of course they're all still competitive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard","Two questions, David, a question on the headcount. Is the 700, is that a gross number or is that a net number? Do you expect to add that back during the year and above the down 700 for the end of the year?","David Henshall","It's a gross number at this point in time. As I said, there are some areas that are absorbing investment right now and will continue to and that's everything from our various SaaS properties where we're seeing strong growth in areas like data, places around networking and mobile where we're just capacity constrained. And then in some cases where you're going through things like off-shoring and just driving more long term efficiencies. So overall headcount will be down, but some of that will be reinvested.","Walter Pritchard","And then, Mark, you've talked a bit about product focus and you mentioned XenServer and some new things coming there and sounds like maybe Sanbolic was partially related to that. Just wondering as you think about product focus, it feels like XenServer is the third or fourth product in its market and objectively hasn't had a ton of traction outside of some of the open-source deployments that some of the cloud providers use and maybe under your own product. What is the value proposition around continuing to invest in that product as a standalone?","Mark Templeton","Walter, so first the way we rationalize the portfolio is you're either a product, a feature or you're a foundational technology. In the case of XenServer, you're foundational technology. The monetization of that technology is indirect through XenApp, XenDesktop and NetScaler SDX. If you look at the contribution of those three products relative to the investment we make in XenServer and our distribution of the open-source XenServer because as a reminder to everyone, last year we moved XenServer into the Linux foundation as a full-fledged open-source project. So there is open-source XenServer and then there is our distribution of XenServer.","So when we moved into the Linux foundation, it was a huge surge of in the community and so our investment in XenServer is -- we're still a great contributor but is a foundational technology. So by itself, the NetScaler SDX product line that really is powered by XenServer and differentiated by XenServer was a $100 million product all by itself.","You're right, we do not have an entry in server virtualization and it's not a market that we compete in directly. And to the degree that customers want to use XenServer as their server virtualization platform either under CloudPlatform or in the raw, they're welcome to do that. But there is not a go-to-market motion in investment related to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Williams with Evercore. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","It's actually Kirk. Mark, could you talk a little bit about what you're doing to simplify the messaging around mobility in the channel? Are conversation with partners continue to indicate there is just some confusion as to the strategy about how each of the product lines come together. And I'm sure you guys have been working on this, but how long does it take to get this fixed in some respects? Is this a multi-quarter challenge for you guys? Or is this something you feel like you've been working on and you can start to see the fruits of those labors by the back half of this year? Any color on that would be helpful. Thanks.","Mark Templeton","Sure. So first we just are coming off of our Partner Summit and we went through the strategy, the message around software-defined workplace and how it relates to mobility. In fact, its core value proposition is to allow customers to mobility transform their business and people. And I think the introduction of the Workspace Suite made it much easier for partners to see how to message and sell our Windows app delivery and mobile app delivery products together in a full solution, especially as we are now coming off of summit. We made it very clear to them that the way to think about this is the desktop is to the PC era is the paradigm for the PC era, but the Workspace is the paradigm for the cloud era.","And so this kind of simplified set of ideas that will be followed through with packaging and pricing and cloudification, etcetera I think begins to really address the partner issues and then I think the other piece of it is that XenMobile 10, when you look at the data on installing the backend, configuring it, etcetera, how much time it takes, the simplicity in learning impact in terms of how to operate it, it's radically better. And I think that by itself is making partners much more interested in learning the message because it's really not that hard and making it part of their go-to-market motion.","So as I mentioned in my prepared comments, what we saw at Partner Summit was huge intent and feedback from partners that they are ready now to integrate it into their portfolio and sales motion now that they feel they can handle the backend parts. So I do think it's multi-quarter, as we drive the message and have tipping points, more tipping point. Some of them are marketing related, demand gen-related. Some of them are product related and innovation related. And so I believe that's what we heard during the Partner Summit in Las Vegas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho. Your line is open. ","Abhey Lamba","Mark, how should we think about the impact of Windows Server 2003 expiry? Have you started seeing any conversations around that and what are you accounting for this year from that?","Mark Templeton","I think the primary message there is that it creates the back pressure for customers to actually look at migrating and so the confluence of all the work that we've done and are still doing around making migration simple lines up with the 2008 end expiration if you will. And clearly Windows Server 12R2 is a great platform. It's the best Windows Server ever.","And we have taken advantage of so much of what's there in XenApp and XenDesktop. Obviously a key part of our partnership with Microsoft. So I would just say it is some tailwind for migration and obviously the more migration tools we provide and training to our partners and the more compelling tipping points we have for value around security, experience and flexibility, all of those actually should bode well for having that as a catalyst and a lever for driving XenApp, XenDesktop migrations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Mark Moerdler","I want to drill in a little bit. Workspace is growing, it's 50% deferred. I'm trying to think, how should we think about how that converts to revenue? Is this more maintenance, more license with longer rollouts, longer contracts? How should we think about that? And then I've got a follow-up.","David Henshall","Yes, Mark, that's the right way to think about it and it would lead to, next year, a higher growth in deferred revenue than we saw in 2014.","Mark Moerdler","So it will be higher growth in deferred, but rolling over -- what the horizon should we think it converts?","David Henshall","The average transaction in Q4 was about three years.","Mark Moerdler","Okay. And the second, just to confirm, make sure we're all it, the $90 million to $100 million, that's after any reinvestment?","David Henshall","No. That's the gross number related specifically to the restructuring items that we called out today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","It's actually Matt in for Pat. Had a question about ShareFile and how you guys compete against Box there. Wonder if you could share some of your win rates and perhaps when you lose and when you win against them. Thanks.","Mark Templeton","ShareFile, we're just really delighted with the results that we've got with ShareFile. So first of all, we actually have surpassed the 60,000 customer mark actually very recently. So the growth rate we're seeing there in terms of customer acquisition we think is actually the greater pace than what they are seeing over at Box.","Secondly, we had focused really, really intensively on two spaces. One is enterprise and the other is in premium SMB verticals and so the reason you see us spending so much time on security is that the verticals that we serve in the SMB side, in the areas of professional services, engineering and construction, brokerage and financial services and healthcare, these customers require support for HIPPA, ERISA, etcetera and we've been very aggressive in supporting those kinds of data security privacy standards. And when we're in those markets, we win. Our win rate is awesome.","On the enterprise side, our win rates are fantastic where we have a customer making more of an enterprise kind of decision and that ranges from big professional services organizations to healthcare and to financial services. And where those decisions are departmental and people are making unilateral decisions outside of IT, that's where we'll see Box probably be a little bit more successful because many times there are deal that we don't tackle ourselves.","I think there is opportunity for us there and especially as we've added this restricted zones which is one of a kind in the market and basically what it means is amongst all the document cloud providers, we're the only one that has technology that allows for data sovereignty and complete anonymity. So we hold no keys, we have no information about your data. Not even the names of files or even owners or publishers of them.","And this is the kind of stuff that when you look at governments, when you look at healthcare, when you look at banks, when you look at other segments where customers are just not comfortable with storage of their documents in the cloud, that this is the kind of thing where we hands-down win. So we'll continue to do more of that and so stay tuned. We are real excited about what we're doing with ShareFile.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rakesh Kumar with Susquehanna. Your line is open. ","Rakesh Kumar","I was hoping if you could elaborate on some of the changes in the Partner Program as it relates to the new CSA initiative and some of the adjustments to partner profit margins that you announced at the Partner Summit?","Mark Templeton","I'll take that. High level, what we're encouraging partners to do is specialize and through specialization that they can generate we believe higher margins, higher profitability. So our incentives for training and certifications are encouraging them to specialize in areas that they have competency or where they see opportunity in their market. This is a change from where we've been, where we've really required broad certification from partners and this new program is very positively received by the partners that were in attendance at our Partner Summit in Las Vegas and then a smaller event in Singapore last week.","So this year between the partner programs that we're initiating as well as partner readiness in terms of products, we're looking forward to really a re-engagement of partners that have been more around the edge and not the broadly certified partner that's like a platinum that's certified on everything that we do.","David Henshall","Rakesh, I would just add that part of moving away from geographic leadership focus in some areas towards organizing around segments will help drive a lot more clarity in terms of what types of accounts are Citrix-led versus what our channel-led and just allow for much broader consistency about the way we engage and that will be helpful for sure.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","David Henshall","Thanks again, everyone for joining the call today. We are clearly helping customers embrace mobile work styles, mobilizing apps, data and people and all powered by Citrix cloud infrastructure and services. I think we're confident we have the right strategy, solution and operational focus as we enter 2015. We look forward to speaking again with everyone in three months. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's Citrix conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Citrix Systems Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites","Thank you, Cathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call where we'll be discussing Citrix's third quarter 2012 financial results.","Participating in the call will be Mark Templeton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Henshall, Executive Vice President of Operations and Chief Financial Officer.","This call is being webcast with a slide presentation on Citrix Systems Investor Relations website, and the slide presentation associated with the webcast will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin the review of the financial results, I want to state that we have posted product classification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to the Investor Relations page of our website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as the impact of the global economic climate, uncertainty in the IT spending environment, risks associated with our products, acquisitions and competition. Obviously, these risks could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.","Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the company's filings with the SEC, including the risk factor disclosure contained in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which is available from the SEC or on the company's Investor Relations website.","Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now, I would like to turn it over to David Henshall, our EVP Operations and Chief Financial Officer. David?","David James Henshall","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As you can see from the release, in Q3, total revenue was $641 million, up 13% from last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.68. Deferred revenue was up 26% year-on-year, and cash flow from ops was $181 million, bringing the trailing 12-month total to over $760 million.","Before I move on, I would like to provide a little context around the business dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Overall, Q3 customer behavior was uneven across really the different markets and products, particularly evident in new license sales due to hesitancy in initiating new capital projects.","The continued macro headwinds drove an unusually large number of opportunities that were either pushed into our future period or split into multiple transactions, with only a portion closing in Q3. This dynamic was most pronounced in North America during September.","Despite these environmental issues, we haven't seen any material changes in the underlying market or competitive dynamics, so the majority of these opportunities remain in the active pipeline. While we were disappointed with the level of new license bookings, we continue to engage with customers at a strategic level.","In total, we closed 42 $1 million plus orders in the quarter, which is our second highest total ever. However, the average value of these transactions declined about 15% sequentially and year-over-year due to the factors that I mentioned earlier. Geographically, the Americas region closed 25 of these strategic transactions, leading to total revenue growth that was up 7% from Q3 2011.","In EMEA, while the results varied across the different areas, revenue was up 20% from last year including 15 $1 million plus transactions.","And finally, the Pacific and Japan regions combined for 17% growth and then closed 2 at least large customer transactions.","So let's look at the Q3 results within our primary markets. First, our Desktop Solutions business grew 10% to over $349 million, while license revenue declined by 1% from last year.","For some context on this business, there's a few metrics that really help demonstrate the market adoption we're seeing in this area.","In Q3, there were over 20 different $1 million plus new license orders for the Desktop products, representing customers in government, finance, services, health care and technology verticals.","In total, we transacted with over 3,000 different customers in this area, which included 153 orders for more than 1,000 seats of XenDesktop and 28 projects for over 5,000 seats.","We now have over 2,000 cloud providers delivering several hundred thousand Desktop licenses as a subscription service to their end customers, representing an important future growth opportunity as more businesses opt for the simplicity of cloud-delivered apps.","And finally, license updates for the Desktop products accelerated to 17% year-on-year growth with strong renewal rates across subscription advantage.","Next, in our Data Center and Cloud business, total revenue was up 15% in the quarter to $127 million, with product revenue increasing 6%. The largest contributor to this business continues to be our NetScaler solutions, with small but accelerating contribution coming from our CloudPlatform business.","The NetScaler growth is coming from a number of different areas. First, we're continuing to drive across all motion into our enterprise account base with over 540 Desktop transactions including NetScaler as part of the solution.","Second, we're expanding the customer base with both MPX hardware appliances and VPX virtual appliance versions of the products, adding more than 500 net new accounts in Q3.","And third, the new high-end SDX service delivery platform is gaining momentum with service providers and large enterprises, up 14% sequentially and representing more than 10% of total NetScaler license sales.","Also in Q3, we closed the acquisition of Bytemobile, giving us a key foothold with mobile network operators and creating an important new on-ramp for integrations with the other cloud networking solutions.","Overall, the Data Center and Cloud business is at a solid performance year-to-date, growing more than 20%.","Next, within our Software as a Service business, revenue was up 18% from last year. Our collaboration products, which account for about 60% of our total SaaS revenue, were up 24%.","In general, we saw steady gains and new customer acquisition from both the direct and online channels, as well as solid retention rates within the subscriber base.","In Q3, we completed the acquisition of Beetil, a small cloud-based services desk technology that will become part of the GoToAssist IT support offering.","Additionally, we announced an updated version of our ShareFile data sharing app with new IT control capabilities to ensure the security of company data when accessed from a mobile device, and new productivity features for users.","So looking at the rest of the P&L, as forecasted, we've seen a slow but steady increase in COGS as a percent of revenue, and the main reason here being the mix of revenue as we've seen higher contribution from consulting services, SaaS and hardware appliances.","Our operating margin increased 100 basis points sequentially, driven by the increase in total revenue and certain cost controls. Cash and investments totaled just over $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter with a sequential decline due to the closing of the Bytemobile acquisition and the repurchase of 1 million shares of stock during the quarter. Our other income was aided by a net gain from our strategic investment portfolio, realized upon the acquisition of one of the companies, which we previously invested in.","And finally, we added about 700 new people to Citrix in the third quarter, bringing total headcount to over 8,000. More than half of the increase came through acquisitions with the remainder from organic hiring as we continue to focus on expanding go-to-market capacity, customer touch and on product innovation to bring the market new technologies as well as improving integrations across the solutions.","Looking into Q4, we would expect the growth in headcount to slow significantly as we focus on absorption and on ramping productivity.","So before I wrap up, I'd like to discuss our current outlook and expectations for Q4 and 2013. Entering Q4, the opportunity pipeline is at a record level. However, given the volatility in customer spending patterns over the past 2 quarters, leaving us appropriate to assume that the environment will continue to be volatile across all geos, and we're planning accordingly.","So for the full year 2012, our current expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.56 billion, and we're slightly increasing the adjusted EPS range to between $2.80 a share and $2.82 a share.","For the fourth quarter 2012, we currently expect total revenue to be in a range of $700 million to $710 million and adjusted EPS of between $0.83 and $0.85 a share.","With respect to 2013, our planning cycle is still in process, which is very normal for this point in the fourth quarter. At this stage, we're balancing the high level of predictability from our subscription-based businesses, which account for more than half of total revenue, within expectation for the spending environment to be -- to continue to be volatile into next year.","So we're currently modeling total revenue growth of at least 14% for next year and a commitment to operating leverage that will drive a minimum of 50-basis-point expansion in adjusted operating margins from the 2012 levels.","Our focus next year will be on helping customers embracing our price mobility, building delivered cloud services and expanding our go-to-market reach through both direct touch and go-to-market partnerships.","We'll update our expectations for 2013 with more specifics on our fourth quarter earnings call. Ultimately, our confidence in our market position and our ability to drive long-term growth remains unchanged.","So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed well in Q3 in spite of the macro factors creating uncertainty around IT spending. The forces of mobile and cloud are fueling a huge transformation, and Citrix is in great position to capitalize on it.","This was very clear last week at our Synergy conference in Barcelona, where the energy level from partners and customers was at an all-time high. We unveiled our latest innovations, solutions and partnerships, showing customers how to design for mobile first and cloud first; how to architect for device and app and location independence; and how to deliver flexible, scalable cloud infrastructure needed to deliver a work-anywhere experience.","So today, I'd like to highlight the announcement that is so vital to our mobile and cloud strategy going forward.","Last week, we demonstrated that mobile is not about devices, it's about a way of working from anywhere, with anyone, across any device. A mobile workstyle solution empowers people to work securely with each other, with their apps, with their data in a seamless, contextual and continuous experience.","Delivering Windows to mobile devices has been a strong driver for XenDesktop and XenApp. From here, we're expanding into the center of the enterprise mobility management market, a market expected to top $3 billion in 2015 with a compelling solution that includes 3 powerful components. First is Citrix Receiver, our universal software client available on over 3 billion devices, including all major tablet, smartphone, laptop, Mac, and PC platforms. The second is CloudGateway, our single unified control point for Windows apps, and now supporting web apps, mobile apps and enterprise data. And the third is the Me@Work mobile app family, 5 Citrix-built apps for collaboration, social teamwork, data sharing, secure email and Internet access. This is a solution approach that leverages both existing and new Citrix technologies, giving us upsell and cross-sell opportunities within our huge partner and customer base, and a solution that gives users the mobility they want and IT organizations the security and control they need across both apps and data.","As a user, you simply download Citrix receiver to your iPad, into your email credentials, and your apps and data are automatically provisioned in minutes, creating secure app work containers for company apps and data that isolate your @work apps from your @life apps. We've just added support for native iOS, native Android, and HTML5 apps, along with autoprovisioning of our cloud-based ShareFile data sharing service.","We also introduced 2 new mobile apps from Citrix, @WorkMail and @WorkWeb, providing enterprise-grade secure e-mail, calendar and contacts and secure browsing for access to corporate websites and SaaS apps through an on-demand Micro VPN. @WorkMail and @WorkWeb now joins Citrix ShareFile, GoToMeeting and Podio to form the Citrix Me@Work mobile app family, providing a secure, amazing work-anywhere experience.","Next is desktop virtualization and where we take it from here. It's just amazing how virtualizing Windows apps and desktops has become more relevant over time from our first remote access product to highly strategic infrastructure now known as desktop virtualization.","Today, there are 5 core customer value drivers. First is desk TCO for desktops and apps by lowering the cost of Windows administration and extending the life of endpoint devices. Second, centralized security and access control. This is especially valuable in regulated industries, government and offshoring projects. Third, faster Windows OS migrations by eliminating the installation of apps on desktops and desktops on devices. Fourth is BI -- BYO and mobility enablement, delivering the Windows experience to personal devices like smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks running any device OS. And fifth is something that we call business TVO, or the total value of ownership, as a strategic infrastructure for faster onboarding of employees, for enabling flexible workspaces, for accelerating M&A integration, for simpler business reorganization or for always-on business continuity.","These drivers have created a value chain where customers can implement projects for TCO, security or OS migrations and, over time, harvest more value by graduating to broader strategic usage for BYO Mobility and TVO. We invented, innovated and have invested in this value chain process in partnership with Microsoft.","These market drivers are more compelling today than they have ever been and will continue into the future, into the Windows 8 year and beyond, which is now just beginning.","The introduction of Windows 8 technology at the endpoint, at the server, and in the cloud will create a new set of partnership opportunities with Microsoft, helping our joint customers merge and migrate traditional Windows apps and desktops with the new world of Windows 8 style devices, apps and cloud services. The Windows 8 wave starts on Friday this week.","The velocity of consumerization is just amazing. In spite of 4 months, we've had new generations of consumer devices along with the apps and cloud services behind them from Apple, from Google, from Amazon, and now from Microsoft and their many OEM partners. It's all part of a major inflection in consumerization and what we believe becomes a new normal for IT. Think of it as fragmentation. This is why we began investing in the reinvention of desktop virtualization a couple of years ago and unveiled it as Project Avalon in Barcelona.","Project Avalon will be delivered in 2 powerful releases. The first release is called Excalibur. Think of it as the cloudification of XenDesktop and XenApp in a single, simple infrastructure designed to speed adoption, to grow the largest scale and to be easier to manage. It features major advances in simplicity, manageability, scalability and rich multimedia services all needed to deliver the Windows experience to millions of devices.","Last week, we've demonstrated the Excalibur and announced the Q4 availability of the tech preview. We just loved the response.","The second release called Merlin adds powerful automation and orchestration features, designed to abstract the way the complexity of the underlying compute network and storage and dramatically simplify day-to-day administration through self-service provisioning.","Together, Excalibur and Merlin will enable customers to deliver Windows as a cloud service, an amazing set of innovations that continues our leadership in Windows app and Desktop delivery.","Next up is cloud infrastructure. Cloud infrastructure is all about building cloud services, bridging between clouds and delivering those services anywhere. At the platform level, we're focused on being an active member of the Apache CloudStack open source project. Momentum around CloudStack is remarkable in terms of download rates and new people joining the community, now over 30,000 strong.","CloudStack has become one of the fastest-growing and most active open source community projects, which is made at the most widely deployed open source cloud platform today.","A number of these clouds are running over 1,000 servers, with the largest being over 30,000 physical servers, powering Infrastructure-as-a-Service and SaaS services that generate over $1 billion in revenue.","We're excited about CloudStack adoption with both enterprise and servers to provide our customers. We're monetizing CloudStack with our new Citrix CloudPlatform solution that includes the support, update and additional technologies needed to build reliable cloud services.","Even though CloudPlatform is hypervisor agnostic, it includes XenServer and has native integration with NetScaler.","In Barcelona, new strategic partners announced their support, including Alcatel Lucent, CA, Cisco and NetApp. There were also announcements from some of the world's largest telecom companies, including BT, China Telecom, Korea Telecom and NTT and how they're standardizing on Citrix CloudPlatform.","We also have some exciting news in cloud networking. We demonstrated the next generation of NetScaler SDX, our consolidated service delivery platform. Introduced last year, SDX allows up to 40 virtual NetScaler instances to run on a single multi-talent -- tenant appliance, an amazing throughput in a very strong and small footprint.","Last week, we introduced the next generation SDX now open to third-party delivery services and unifying for the first time ever a wide range of Layer 4 to 7 network services in a seamless application control later.","Top-tier partners have stepped up to support the new SDX platform, including Aruba Networks, Palo Alto Networks, RSA, Splunk and Trend Micro. The new SDX includes the ability to apply app-driven policies that automate the deployment of network services. This will also provide app layer intelligence to existing transport networks and emerging SDN solution.","We also introduced an exciting new addition to our Citrix Bytemobile product line, designed to further optimize data and video traffic, extending our value within the explosive growth of rich media over 3G, 4G and LTE networks. Our new UXI technology allows Bytemobile infrastructure to autonomically adjust mobile data optimization in response to real-time sensing of user experience. It's a powerful new innovation that gives users a better mobile experience while saving millions in bandwidth cost for mobile network operators.","The combination of CloudPlatform, NetScaler and Bytemobile positions us well for the massive buildout of cloud services that's transforming private data centers, cloud providers and mobile operators around the world.","At Synergy, we expanded our strategic partnership with Cisco, which began just over a year ago, when we announced a multiyear initiative to give customers a brilliant, high-def experience when delivering Citrix XenDesktop over Cisco networks.","Over the last year, working together, tens of thousands of virtual desktops have been deployed worldwide, serving customers of every size and across every industry segment.","In addition to the great technology innovations, we've also developed some effective go-to-market programs around the world. To build on this success, we're expanding into 3 new strategic areas: mobility, cloud and networking.","First, our collaboration in mobility will result in a powerful set of integrated solutions for mobile workstyles and BYO. These solutions will bring together the combined strength of Citrix Receiver, CloudGateway, XenDesktop and ShareFile with Cisco's Jabber collaboration portfolio, secure access products and media net technology. Working together, we'll give customers an unparalleled experience for accessing any mix of apps, data, voice and video across billions of mobile devices.","Secondly is our collaboration in cloud will result in an open integrated cloud solution for both enterprise and service provider customers. This will bring together Citrix CloudPlatform with the technologies like Cisco Nexus switches, Cisco UCS servers and Cisco ONE networking technologies. This powerful combination will make it easy for customers of all sizes to build through Amazon style clouds with incredible scalability, elasticity and economics.","Finally, our collaboration in networking will help customers deliver cloud scale networks with built-in application intelligence. The centerpiece of this strategy will involve integrating Citrix NetScaler as a strategic component in the Cisco Cloud Network Services architecture, right alongside core Cisco networking services. As part of this strategy, Cisco will also reference to NetScaler to its worldwide customer base as a preferred solution for next-generation app delivery controllers.","Both companies are investing significantly in technology innovation, solution integration and joined go-to-market capacity. We're excited to take this key relationship to the next level, and we're convinced it will deliver tremendous value for Citrix, for Cisco and for our joint customers.","So last week was both exciting and really important for Citrix. We're moving aggressively with innovation, solutions and partnerships and establishing our focal points for 2013 to grow end-to-end across social collaboration, enterprise mobility, Windows-as-a-Service and cloud infrastructure markets.","Looking forward, there's ambiguity and uncertainty in a macro sense, creating even greater stress on IT organizations who are already challenged by transformation, consumerization and the fragmentation of computing.","While all this can create headwinds to even the most compelling solutions, it's also an environment that spotlights the value we deliver at the enterprise frontiers of efficiency, speed and agility. So the current environment doesn't change our view of these markets. It increases our commitment, our confidence in our strategy, the tight focus on execution and belief in our opportunity.","Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to share some news about the loss of a valued long-time Citrix colleague and friend, John Burris. We lost John on Friday after his terrible fight with colon cancer. He was 57. Before John became CEO of Sourcefire in 2008, he'd left an indelible mark on Citrix and the many people he touched. For 10 critical years in our evolution, John successfully led our global sales and services teams and was a vital member of the executive leadership team. John was someone whose wisdom was always in demand. You could always count on John for the truth, for optimism and for a lot of fun. He was always caring, authentic and professional.","From here, we celebrate John's life of good work and the joyful memories he's left with so many people around the world.","And now, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you guys could give us a little more color on your guidance for next year? I'm wondering, usually you give a very conservative forecast at this time of the year for the out-year, and I'm just wondering what are the things giving you the greatest confidence in the 14% revenue growth level for 2013 given your overall commentary about the macro as we look to close out 2012?","David James Henshall","Sure, Heather. This is David. Obviously, we're heavily influenced by the overall uncertainty of the environment right now and how as we've seen that over the past couple of years impact just the timing of customers pulling the trigger on new capital orders. You offset that with the fact that we've got well over half of our total revenue base coming from subscription or annuity type services, whether those are our license updates, which continue to do very well and have actually been accelerating over the past year; our SaaS solutions, which are coming in right near 20%; and technical services because there continues to be a tremendous amount of demand for knowledge transfer and helping customers be successful with implementations of large solutions like virtualization of the desktop and others. The -- so I'm looking at the number of different growth engines. They are kind of incremental even to what we're doing today. It's innovation in areas like CloudGateway, which helps drive enterprise mobility and help customers adopt BYO including access to things like native apps and whatnot. We've got data sharing, which is really now coming on through our ShareFile integration. We've got networking across a number of different areas, including some pretty interesting things we're very excited about with Cisco. And then inorganically, we're also looking at incremental opportunity through Bytemobile, which as I mentioned has just closed earlier this quarter. That's addressing the explosive growth around carrier networks and also opens up a new market opportunity for us to pull through NetScaler and some of the other products. So that's really the layer of cake of how we've thought about this going into next year.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But if I could -- I'm sorry. I was just going to ask a follow-up. The Desktop Solutions business, I mean, that's one where, I think, based on kind of what I'm hearing from people, is one of the areas where growth has been a lot slower this year than what they would have thought, and I think you've started the year talking about a low to mid-teens growth rate in that segment, and looking out to next year, how do you -- should we think about that business kind of reaccelerating from the levels that we've seen kind of this quarter and last quarter?","David James Henshall","Yes, Heather. I think it's definitely one that's going to be influenced by the environment to some extent. And I think after Q4, we'll give more granularity in terms of the individual product areas. But overall, it's just still an opportunity that is generating hundreds of millions of dollars for us is solving some real world imperatives for a lot of our customers and has an opportunity pipeline that is, well, I'll just say it's significantly higher than it's ever been. So really excited about the opportunity, so the timing that is more specific. Mark talked about an -- more of individual things that we really focused on in the short term that tend to be more tactical around virtualization of the desktop and whether that is addressing mobile, whether that is M&A integration, compliance, security, those things that people are going to spend money on in any environment. And in the longer term, the things that we're doing from a product level to really address complexity and making it way, way easier for customers to adopt scale and manage large infrastructure at the type of level that they're looking. So long answer, lot of things going on, and it's going to be a bit lumpy given the environment for -- probably for the next couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question will be from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This has been sort of an interesting quarter across our group where we've had different companies call out different pockets of weakness. You all saw it in the U.S., which is different in some. Could you maybe drill down on where you saw it, was it a particular vertical? And as you look into the fourth quarter, are you assuming that the deals continue to be smaller, broken apart as you described. What are some of the assumptions underpinning the fourth quarter guide in the U.S?","David James Henshall","Sure, Adam. It's David again. In terms of verticals, there is nothing that really stood out from an end -- kind of an end industry. It was more of the phenomenon that I mentioned earlier where deals just pushed. We had a disproportionate number of push, get smaller in some cases where something was carried at x and closed at 75% of that number, or in the case where customers just actively set up. I'm going to cut this into a few transactions and spread it over the next couple of quarters. So I think that's just the general impact of the overall environment. More specifically in terms of regions, the one area that was quite weak for us was around U.S. Fed. That is an area that is, again, somewhat lumpy but more weak in Q4. And then in a couple of markets as you'd expect in EMEA, those were challenging as well.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And if I could just ask a follow-up. This -- in this quarter, like some of the last several quarters, there's a pretty wide delta between your billings growth rate and your license growth rate. Could you maybe give us some color on the bridge there? Did you see more longer-term deals going into deferred? Are you comfortable giving any kind of deferred license number? Maybe help us get from the license growth rate to the billings growth rate?","David James Henshall","Sure, Adam. In terms of actually breaking out the component of deferred, we've never done that and we really don't want to because they do bounce around quarter-to-quarter. Overall, I'd say that we did close what was probably the second highest quarter ever for large transactions. So we're executing with customers at that level, and those do tend to have some element of either term base or annual licenses or, in some cases, where customers will buy a more ELA-type agreement. And so you look at the growth in long-term deferred revenue, that's usually the best proxy. I think long-term deferreds are up 54%, if I recall, year-on-year, and it's been one of the bigger growth engines there. So that's probably the best way to think about it. We're still focused mostly on short-term transactions, the majority of business is still in a year, but this trend we've been highlighting for a couple of quarters is one that will be slow but kind of steady up into the right.","Operator","Our next question will be from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just on the quarter, itself, and the large deals, David, can you share what proportion was SI driven, just to help us understand sort of what component might have gone to deferred from some of those larger deals?","David James Henshall","Sure, Bhavan. I wouldn't say that SI in particular tend to have a higher or lower deferred. It's really on a deal-by-deal basis. Overall, SIs -- contribution from SIs was up about 11% year-on-year, representing again probably in the 15% of product bookings, largest contributors continue to be Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Fujitsu and then Dimension Data. Those are the 4 biggest ones in the quarter. It's an interesting area that we spent a lot of time focusing on. We now have about 10,000 people across SIs that have been trained, and we met with a huge number of them last week in Synergy Barcelona. And a lot of the message was around how we provide more capacity out to customers because in a lot of areas we are, let's call it capacity constrained from an implementation but also from a knowledge transfer standpoint to make sure that successful early implementations extend to that next phase and become more enterprise wall-to-wall. So work in process, and we're excited about the opportunity, but it's going to take some time.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, yes. And then similar to last quarter where you had some deals pushed and then they closed, did you see -- sort of we're now 3.5, 4 weeks into the quarter, have you seen a similar phenomenon or has it been less pronounced than it was in, say, the beginning of Q3?","David James Henshall","Yes. The beginning of Q3 was interesting because Q2 had much more, let's call it short-term noise around some economic changes in EMEA, and that caused a big pause in the last week or so. This quarter was also near the second half of September, I'd say, was much more pronounced. But there wasn't any general dislocation out there or any news event that caused that. I think it's more of just, in general, customer behavior. So this resizing, pushing of deals, splitting of deals late in the quarter, it's more of just the general concern as customers look into Q4 and into 2013.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, yes. And maybe one quickly for Mark. Mark, you're obviously talking to customers and CIOs and operations executives all the time. Sort of as you look at next year coming into this year, desktop virtualization, application virtualization, ranked pretty high on that top 10 list of things to do. Sort of any sense of how that feels going into '13?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, I don't think it feels any differently. I think what's different is their anticipation of their own businesses and how that affects the IT budget, and the mix of spend in sort of run versus grow kinds of categories. And there's no doubt that a whole bunch of the growth that we've seen in desktop virtualization has come from really grow kinds of initiatives, more of the TVO kinds of implementations that have been really profound when you look at some of the larger customers we have around the world. But that means that projects and more of the TCO type style implementations will be -- will probably dominate more customers as they look to sort of squeeze through, which looks like to us and to them to be a pretty uncertain environment. So I think this is a macro issue and becomes a timing issue, and I think we'll be one of the first to benefit from a change in buying behavior as there's a lot of pent-up understanding and demand around the value of desktop virtualization. And, of course, the intersection of that with the product cycle we're driving, first with the release of the Excalibur, the release of Avalon, I feel really good about where we're going in that space.","Operator","Our next question will be from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","On the networking side of the business, could you drill down a little bit more on the new Cisco relationship and the expansion there? I think you talked about integrating NetScaler as strategic component of Cisco's cloud networking strategy and referred to the reference sell that Cisco is going to do. So are the salespeople actually compensated? Is there more formalization in that relationship that needs to occur, and now that Cisco is really no longer in the market with its own ADC, would you hope to pick up a fraction of that revenue, a majority of that revenue that they enjoyed in the market?","Mark B. Templeton","So the way to understand this is as a series of phases that really starts with the reference selling and doing certified designs to put NetScaler in place for customers that have been using Cisco load balancers and want to move to an advanced delivery controller kind of architecture. And as I mentioned in the comments, the reference sell is really, if Cisco sales force will refer customers to us as a preferred solution for those that want to move forward. They'll still continue to support ACE, they said that. But for customers that want to move forward to ADC, they'll reference sell NetScaler. The second phase really, which starts actually now as well, is really more about technical integrations that allow NetScaler to become part of the Cisco fabric. And so I think everyone knows that Cisco has done a tremendous amount of work in making their intelligent network platform highly programmable and at the lower layers of the network. And we've done a lot of work to make NetScaler programmable at the higher layers of the network. And so a key project is to get that integration going so that NetScaler can pass the application awareness from the higher layers into the transport network and vice versa so that we can do a lot of really interesting and autonomic kinds of configuration and reconfiguration of the network based upon the upper layers of demand all the way down to the lower layers of transport. So that will be the second phase, and you can expect that to be more -- a few quarters out. And then the final phase is really how we integrate further with the overall Cisco cloud networking platform and strategy, which will play out over -- simultaneously and over a longer period of time. So this is a multiyear commitment and agreement and partnership, and we're pretty excited about it and it's off to a great start. As far as the details around compensation and all of those things, I think you need to expect that for this year, the reference selling, everyone already has as fiscal year plan, et cetera, and the timing of this relationship and putting things in place allow us to incorporate what we want to do to compensate people in the field properly in 2013 and beyond to get even greater levels of collaboration. So it's very strategic, and we'll back it with great investments and great tactical, if you will, kinds of programs that -- to make sure everyone's on the same page, pulled in the same direction.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. David, on the Desktop Solutions update side, you've seen increased growth this year on a year-over-year basis, and I think it may have even accelerated a little bit sequentially given the year-over-year growth for our updates. Is that a function of renewal rates? Are there other timing issues at play here? And as we -- I know it's early to think about the components of '13, but should you sustain in that kind of mid-teens growth rate there?","David James Henshall","Rob, it's a function of a couple of different things. One of them is the transition that we've made from XenApp to XenDesktop over the years, and just to be able to yield a higher amount per customer. Second is the more strategic nature of -- I hate to call it that, but the more strategic nature of Desktop is part of a customer's infrastructure tends to yield a higher renewal rate. And we've been slowly rolling out the idea of software maintenance, which includes not only the license updates but also more of an integrated support solution, and that carries a higher ASP. And so that's one of the things that we've been doing on a very slow basis but has a lot of room to run over the next couple of years as we can get closer and closer to customers.","Operator","And your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to dig into the Desktop Solutions line a bit, and then just sort of get your kind of expectations when you look at Q4 and kind of what's sort of implied in the guidance there and then for next year. I mean, obviously, you guys talked about the license line being down a little bit. That's not necessarily shocking, given the tough comp. But just what trends do you see in there? And then as you do think about the guidance, how should we think about sort of the license revenue growth for that in Q4 and the next year also in, obviously, the context of what is still a good license update line?","David James Henshall","Sure, Phil. In terms of like forward-looking guidance, we haven't broken out individual products. And I don't think it makes sense to do that right now. It's -- there's going to be some give and take, given the breadth of our product portfolio. And so within this environment, we're going to just stick to a pretty high level of guidance and then just describe the actual dynamics of the business in much more detail when we have actuals. That's kind of what I'd say about guidance. In terms of the overall trends, we talked about a few of them earlier. I mean, there's really nothing going on from a market or competitive dynamics standpoint that's worth noting. We are still -- when we look at our CRM system, we're still winning the exact same amount of transactions. We're engaged now at, I believe, it's just over 80% of the Fortune 100 at some level with XenDesktop as an individual product, and the number of new POCs and opportunities continue to be very, very strong. The dynamic, though, that I talked about earlier, was this whole deals getting resized, deals getting pushed, deals getting split. And I think that the expectation should be that you will see that in Q4 again, and we're planning accordingly for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mark, I want to ask, just understanding the macro, but I think the minus 1%, for example, in the Desktop is probably worse than we expected, even understanding the macro, it was pretty bad. And I'm wondering from an execution perspective, is there anything, any story in the numbers around execution and any changes you've made in the organization or otherwise to compensate for that going forward?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Walter. Actually, if you look at the performances across all the geos, you see a lot of consistency and how people reacted to headwinds and the impact on their businesses. So -- and that actually gives us a lot of confidence in kind of where we are in both execution and people, and so there's no abnormal set of issues around any particular part of the business. We're always up-leveling, upgrading, working on the bottlenecks, et cetera, and there's nothing unusual there when it comes to in market, go-to-market execution.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, David, on the 14% preliminary growth for next year, is that a number that doesn't assume any M&A that hasn't happened already, or how are you considering M&A in the number? I know this year, actually M&A did have somewhat of an impact.","David James Henshall","No, that's just what we have today.","Operator","Your next question comes from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.","Darren R. Jue - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's actually Darren Jue on for John. I want to follow up on Phil's question about M&A. If you could give us an idea of how much of the growth in the quarter, in the current quarter, came from acquisitions, and what is implied in the guidance for next year?","David James Henshall","Well, let me talk about next year first. So when we think about 2013, even though we're not breaking out any of the individual pieces, I mean the only acquisition that we've done in 2012 that really had ongoing revenue stream is Bytemobile. Everything else is looking back into 2011, and to a large extent, we were acquiring technologies, new things that we were integrating and starting to grow and expand. So when I look at it that way, I'd say everything except Bytemobile is organic going into 2013. And while we haven't called out the individual components, I think Byte as a standalone should be at least $50 million of revenue. I mean, it's a really interesting market, addressing the cellular networks and the explosive growth that you're seeing right now across just, call it consumerization, but it's largely in video multimedia traffic across these networks. And so the number is still in process as we work through our 2013 plans, and I'll get more specificity after the end of this quarter. At a high level, that's how I think about it.","Darren R. Jue - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And one other question, David. You mentioned that part of the reason for the operating margin increase this quarter was related to cost controls, and I wonder if you could just discuss what some of those controls were?","David James Henshall","It's just the normal things you see, Darren, in this type of an environment. When you've got a little less certainty externally, you pull on the levers that tend to be variable in nature. And so while we did expand headcount at a fairly material way, a large part of that was through acquisition and the -- and college hires that we've already committed to, and things like that. So we look at the other discretionary line items, whether that is travel or external consultants or things like that, that we always dial back when the environment is less certain. So you should expect that to be the case in Q4 as well.","Operator","And your next question is from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got 2 questions for you. The first one is how do you see the attach to the Windows 7 Desktop refresh, we've seen about 50% has moved to Windows 7. Is the sensed expectation that the second half will have more desktop virtualization because of the nature of the PCs? And then I got a second question to follow up.","Mark B. Templeton","Mark, so the Windows 7 impact is really all about an OS migration that then opens the overall question with customers, in consideration with customers around thinking about virtualization at the desktop, virtual apps or full virtual desktops, whether they're VDI style or what I think of is a VDI \"light\", which is more of a server-hosted version of a Windows 7 desktop. So that's the effect of the Windows 7 motion that's in the marketplace, not specifically around the refreshing of devices, okay? So we see that continue, and we're halfway through the physical migration to Windows 7 as measured by devices. But I'd say that we're not nearly halfway through in terms of potential for virtualizing Windows desktops, Windows 7 style desktops for, let's say, new Windows 8 style devices or Windows 7 style applications, which tend to be built on the Win32 architecture and virtualizing them to deliver them to a full range of devices, including the new Windows 8 style devices. So that's how we think about Win 7. And not as much around attach, but around consideration rate for desktop virtualization as a new way of delivering the Windows experience.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Perfect. Okay, the second quick question was through the quarter, some people have commented that September was a little -- was showing more weakness than the rest of the quarter. Was there any sense that there was a slowdown in this -- that break-apart that were occurring at deals was accelerating toward the end of the quarter?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, I think that's absolutely what we saw.","Operator","Our next question will be from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","David, just a quick clarification. The amount of Desktop business that is sitting in deferred revenue as of September 30, is it fair to say that, that went up on a sequential basis?","David James Henshall","Yes, it did go up on a sequential basis.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And I know you said that operating margins will expand by a minimum of 50 basis points in 2013, so it's not necessarily a ceiling. But would -- just wondering if you could perhaps walk through some of the assumptions behind the 50-basis-point improvement, because unless we were to see another sizable acquisition like Bytemobile, I probably would have thought that we would see maybe a little bit more expansion in the out-year.","David James Henshall","Yes, right now, this is at this stage in the planning cycle, what you'd expect. It's more of a directional indicator the way we're thinking about constructing a business plan for 2013. I mean, you spend most of the time, at this point, looking at the individual markets, how products are going to continue to evolve and develop market share assumptions, et cetera, and then we kind of flow that down the P&L through the rest of the operating line items. And so when I say that our -- it's more of a commitment to driving up margin up, and that's how it should be interpreted, because at this point in time, we're still working through our business plan, want to make sure that we're investing for long-term growth, long-term profitability, long-term success, et cetera, but doing that in the context of improving op margins overall. So I wouldn't get too much into the detail until we get into probably the end of this quarter, and we can talk more specifically about the business. And that is -- it's not anticipating large dilutive acquisitions as part of your question. This is just as we see the business right now going into 2013. Should we do anything material? We'll come back and talk about that if that would ever happen.","Operator","Our next question will be from Kirk Materne with Evercore Partners.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","It's Matt Williams, actually, in for Kirk. Just curious if you could speak to some of the trends around ShareFile, and if the enterprise reps are now selling ShareFile, or just some general commentary on that business.","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, we're really pleased with the growth of ShareFile now 1 year into the acquisition and integration process. So we're growing on 3 dimensions. In the SMB market, where we've had a focus with SMB customers for professional file sharing and -- including PDR services, and that continues to do quite well. Secondly is in verticals. So we've taken ShareFile in some key verticals that we focus on, and that growth has been an excellent. And then the third has been enterprise, which has exceeded our expectations in terms of the interest of customers or the poll. The engagement of our enterprise sales force as well as our partners and the product team has actually done a lot of things to innovate, to make ShareFile enterprise-scale and ready. So last week, we announced, for example, the availability of a new capability called Storage Zones, which allows enterprise customers to choose where documents and files are stored. So yes, they can choose zones in the cloud, but also they can create their own zones in their private cloud or data center. This helps especially in industries and enterprises that have -- that are under heavy government regulation, et cetera, and knowing exactly the physical location of files and where they're stored and how they're transited is key to compliance and governance. So we just released that capability. We have some exciting plans around Storage Zones, and I think that'll bode well for growth into 2013 and beyond, especially as we make ShareFile more and more integrated with all of our end-user-facing capabilities, whether it's GoToMeeting or Podio, within the Receiver infrastructure itself. And the team is doubled, more than doubled. So we have about 200 people on the team now in Raleigh, and we're expanding the facilities there and we're really delighted with the progress we're making there.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great, thanks. And then if I may, just a quick follow-up. You touched on it in another question, but is there any more color you could provide on the Federal business? It sounded like it came in considerably weaker than maybe you were expecting. So just any more color around that business will be helpful.","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, I would say it was one where, probably more pronounced than any other individual area, individual transactions push. And it also has the added phenomenon of, in many cases, we are part of a larger opportunity that a systems integrator, for example, is working on. And there's a number of them that I can -- at least a few that I can think of off the top of my head, large scale transactions that have actually -- the order has been placed through the government to the SI, but the project itself will not roll out for the next couple of quarters. So for us, we don't take revenue, or we actually don't take a booking until we get that from the SI. So it's real business that'll come through in the next couple of quarters, but just not in the time frame that we would have expected it to.","Operator","Our next question will be Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","[indiscernible] kind of increasing adoption of tablets in the enterprise, and what does it do to that licensing model there?","Mark B. Templeton","Raimo, can you repeat the question? Actually, the first half was cut off.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Oh, sorry. Yes, I was saying you don't really break out XenApp and XenDesktop that much in detail anymore. But qualitatively, can you talk about what you see with XenApp at the moment, especially as we see increasing adoption of the iPads in the enterprise? And what does it do to that licensing -- part of the licensing model?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, I think we continue to see XenApp seeking its own level in terms of the mix vis-\u00e0-vis in Desktop. And I'd say, if anything, we'd expect more of a renewed interest in XenApp itself given that virtualizing apps is kind of what it's all about, that's why we call it XenApp. It also includes the VDI \"light\" kind of FlexCast Delivery model, which is also very economical and very powerful. So as we've said pretty consistently, I'd say, is that we leave these decisions to customers. We show them kind of how the incremental capabilities of XenDesktop, which incorporates XenApp, can be valuable. I'd say XenDesktop tends more toward a strategic kind of infrastructure buyer, and XenApp will tend more toward more of a project-oriented buyer, that's TCO and security and access control kind of focused. But I think it gives us, basically, 2 entries in the marketplace that can respond to customers as the environment dictates, and that's a good problem to have.","Operator","Our next question will be from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mark, I just wanted to understand a little bit more about the macro comment you made. I think we all tend to lump everything into the macro category, but I'm wondering if you could tell me, what are customers exactly saying when they say macro? Probably, they don't even say macro, but are you hearing fiscal close as the source of the uncertainty? Is it U.S. customers, European businesses and the unpredictability of that, that is the source of uncertainty, or is it just election cycle? It looks like this has been a very interesting reporting season, the pace of deceleration, not just for your company but just across the group, has been pretty significant. And I'm wondering if it's not just concerned about macro but something even deeper than that, or maybe there isn't, I'm just making it up. But I just wanted to get your thoughts, what exactly on customers' minds when they explain to you why they split up a transaction or pushing something out?","Mark B. Templeton","Kash, great question. I -- first of all, I'm not an economist, and I'm not going to pretend to be one. But I'd say your list of possible sort of causes and concerns that customers have is a long one, and it's all of the above, and that's the issue. It's the length of the list probably more so than any one single thing. And then when you look across geographies, obviously, I'm thinking about an election cycle, et cetera, there's no way to sort of map those things across geographies. But we saw this phenomenon, as I mentioned earlier, on a global basis, and I think other companies and peers that have reported have reported similar customer behaviors. So I think it's the -- it's kind of all those things, and when people feel like there's -- they can't count on the future and it gets even more ambiguous, they pull back. And we saw this going into the recession. There was a pullback where customers had to reconsider their investments and which way they're going to go, and that can be a couple quarter of cycle before they decide, Okay, these are the things that we do want to invest in, and these are the things that we push below the line. And I think we probably are in the midst of that, and, unfortunately, also in an environment where no one sees a catalyst that will change things in any material way. So I'd say that's it. And so we see acknowledgment of value proposition, et cetera, the customers have already tipped over strategically with desktop virtualization. They continue to go because they actually yield both the cost savings and the speed and agility capabilities that it promises and delivers. But I think it's -- in our business, there's a bigger impact on customers that have yet to get to that point, and a lot of our growth relies on tipping customers over from and sort of project-oriented thinking about desktop virtualization to more strategic thinking about it and then jumping in and doing it. So that's why we see these phenomenon late in the quarter. Customers holding positions till late and then deciding to push, or if they go resizing in some way, either splitting or deciding that we're going to buy fewer -- lesser quantity and buy more in concert with what we can consume, let's say, next quarter. So I think that's what everyone -- I think that's pretty natural consumption behavior.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Do we get a budget flush after the elections or not, from your perspective?","David James Henshall","Well, I mean -- this is David. I think we've always been under the belief that there's no -- there's not really such thing as a budget flush. And that's because customers tend to spend and buy what they need. I will say that Q4 always is the largest quarter of the year, and some of that is due to -- on large part, let's say, is due to business models, the way they're built, and compensation plans. Lot of opportunities get queued up to close in Q4. So we'll take it if it comes, but we've certainly never modeled one or expected it.","Mark B. Templeton","I mean, I'd say certainly that if one factor around uncertainty is settled, then that could be -- it would be a positive thing. But I don't think it changes kind of all the other things that are on everyone's mind in terms of global growth and financial markets and kind of where things are looking for that catalyst. And so I think we're assuming that now after couple of years of, I think, moving sideways in terms of the U.S. economy, my point of view that probably looking at the same going forward where there's a tremendous focus on productivity and this thing called the efficient frontier, which it doesn't produce jobs but it does produce projects that create productivity, create opportunities, like what we're doing in mobile and Windows' as a cloud service and some of the other areas around cloud infrastructure, around collaboration services. So I think that's what we're looking at.","Operator","Our next question will be from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","[indiscernible] splits OS migration actually just kind of a variational question that's been asked. And, Mark, you've been clear that there are many drivers and this is maybe just one of them. My question relates to Windows XP, and as we approach the end of life, do you think that 2013 will be a more active year to see Windows XP migrations than we saw in 2012?","Mark B. Templeton","Steve, no -- absolutely, no doubt. And we'll line up a number of our products and technologies to help customers deal with that and -- as they get to kind of a point of no return, they will have to decide to move forward. And we'll do the -- we'll line up the things we're doing with the Excalibur release of Avalon, plus our App-DNA migration infrastructure, plus the professional services scale-up that we're doing ourselves and through our partners, plus some of the things that we're doing programmatically through something we call the accelerator program. So we'll line all those up so that we'll simplify it as much as possible for customers to move forward from XP to Windows 7 environment is most likely in enterprise, because I think most people are expecting that the Windows 8 phenomenon will be much more of a consumer phenomenon when it comes to apps and desktops and -- I mean devices, and sort of the apps and desktops world will be more driven by Windows 7.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Mark Templeton, for closing comments.","Mark B. Templeton","Thank you. Thanks, again, for joining the call today. We're facing an environment of uncertainty, and I can assure you, you can count on us to face this environment with a healthy mix of caution, focus, but also aggressiveness.","So we'll see you next quarter in our Q4 report in about 3 months. Thanks, and have a great quarter.","Operator","This now concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great evening."],"5462":["Citrix Systems, Inc.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Citrix Systems' Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Eduardo Fleites, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Eduardo Fleites - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Kyle. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's second quarter 2015 earnings presentation. Participating on the call will be Mark Templeton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Henshall, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on Citrix Systems Investor Relations website. The webcast will be posted immediately following the call.","Before we begin, I want to state that we have posted product specification and historical revenue trends related to our product groupings to our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind you that today's conversation will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. securities law. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Obviously these risks can cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. Additional information concerning these and other factors is highlighted in today's press release and in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC or on the company's Investor Relations website.","Furthermore, we will discuss various non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC's Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call can be found at the end of today's press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to David Henshall, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. David?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As you can see from the release, total revenue was $797 million, adjusted operating margin was up to 24.8%, adjusted EPS was $1 per share, up 20.9%, and we generated cash flow from ops of $201 million. The restructuring actions that we initiated last year are delivering good results, as we work on simplifying focus, portfolio and rebalancing of investments. The results for Q2 reflect the progress our team has made in absorbing and adjusting to the restructuring, org and leadership evolution and changes to our field in channel strategies that we implemented in Q1.","In the quarter, we continued to see some FX impact, largely in EMEA, but in line with our expectations. From a geo perspective, excluding SaaS, total revenue in EMEA was flat in the quarter. Americas was up slightly, but results in the Pacific declined 8% year-on-year. In total, we closed 46, $1 million-plus transactions with more than half coming from the Workspace services business.","Looking to Q2 results within our three primary groups; Our Workspace services grew 3% year-on-year to $406 million. We continue to drive a broad conversation with our customers about transforming their delivery of IT services, securely and efficiently across all types of applications and data. While overall net new license in this business declined modestly, this is the third quarter in a row that we saw improving year-on year-performance. And as we've discussed previously, there's a number of different initiatives we're driving to improve results in this business through simplification, innovation and aggregation of our unique assets.","So for example, in Q2, we saw solid uptake of our Workspace suite, our comprehensive solution for securely accessing all types of applications, data, desktops, which contributed over 10% of license revenue for this group. It also drove the majority of the $20 million growth in long-term deferred revenue as a number of customers chose to enter into multi-year contracts. Additionally, we continue to grow our CSP business, where partners utilized XenApp and XenDesktop subscriptions to deliver as-a-service offerings to their customers. This quarter the Windows App Delivery CSP represented 6% of license revenue, growing 21% year-on-year.","So we're delivering a complete mobile solution, allowing customers of all sizes to bridge between the worlds of Windows and mobile, on-premise or service based, and do it all in a customer-centric experience that only Citrix can provide.","So next in our delivery networking, total revenue decreased 3.5% in the quarter to $173 million. The decline is driven by two factors. First, license contribution from our ByteMobile business declined by about 50% from last year. As we indicated in our release, we've been in the process of exploring alternatives for this business over the past several months, and as you'd imagine, this process has been significantly disruptive to the team and ultimately the results.","Second factor was the very difficult comp in the cloud services segment of the NetScaler business. As we talked about last quarter, we expected this segment to be down significantly from last year. In Q2, the segment declined 40%, only representing about one quarter of the NetScaler mix. Offsetting this was the enterprise ADC segment, which increased by more than 8% from Q2 a year ago.","For more context on the enterprise segment, let me touch on a few metrics for the quarter. First, solution sales led to over 650 virtualization orders that included networking as part of the solution. This is roughly a 10% attach rate, which is an increased contribution from a year ago. We sold to roughly 2,200 unique customers in the period, with approximately 40% of those being net new. From a mix perspective, both the NetScaler SDX platform and the VPX family of virtual appliances grew by more than 40% and 20% respectively. Together these two platforms represented 40% of the total NetScaler license mix.","And finally, our SaaS-based solutions delivered revenue of $178 million, up 10%. The communications cloud remains the largest part of this business, contributing over 60% of the mix and growing about 11%. Our secure data platform, ShareFile, was up 44% in subscription revenue with the majority of this growth coming across document-centric verticals and enterprise customers.","As you saw in our announcement, we're planning to review strategic alternatives for our GoTo family of products. This decision comes from ongoing work to simplify the portfolio and focus on our core enterprise markets for secure app delivery of apps and data. We've built GoTo into a great business over the past decade, and our belief is that there may be opportunities to create further value for this pure-play SaaS business if not constrained by the company's overall operating model. However, please note that we're just at the very beginning of the process, so we won't be sharing further details at this time.","Turning to operations; we're seeing results from the restructuring initiatives that we've been discussing over the past few quarters. In Q2, our adjusted op margin was 24.8%, up more than 500 basis points sequentially and more than 300 basis points year-on-year. In total, operating expenses declined sequentially, despite continued investments into our higher-growth businesses. We're happy with the current progress and will be working with the Operations Committee of the Board to continue to drive efficiencies and focus growth throughout the company.","Our adjusted tax rate in Q2 was 16% as compared to 16.9% a year ago. And similar to 2014, the closing of certain tax audits contributed to the lower rate. On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations, as I mentioned, was $201 million, leading to about $850 million over the trailing 12-month period. This represents approximately $5.23 a share. Deferred revenue increased $24 million sequentially to $1.54 billion, representing a 2% sequential growth and 8% year-on-year. A large part of this growth is coming from long-term deferred. This is through the multi-year customer engagements that I referenced earlier. And finally, we repurchased 700,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $66. This leaves approximately $116 million remaining under the current buyback program.","So turning to our current outlook and expectations for Q3 and fiscal year 2015, I'd like to first provide a little bit of context around our guidance. Last quarter we said that we would continue to optimize the business model by taking the actions necessary to drive our targets. Streamlining the organization, initiating a multi-year expansion of margins and simplifying focus on our core growth markets. And this afternoon we made a number of additional announcements aligned with these outcomes. We're confident that these can lead to even better execution, greater efficiencies and profitable growth. However, given the level of change occurring in the business, we do want to be mindful of the potential for short-term disruption in the second half.","So our expectations for the full year of 2015 include maintaining the current range of total revenue at $3.22 billion to $3.25 billion, while raising the adjusted EPS range to $3.65 to $3.75 per share. Additionally, we've previously committed to increasing full-year op margins by at least 100 point points over 2014. Based on this outlook, we currently expect to finish the year significantly ahead of this goal.","For Q3 2015, our expectations are for a total revenue growth in the range of $780 million to $790 million, and adjusted EPS of between $0.83 and $0.85 a share. And finally, once the process around ByteMobile is completed, we'll provide an update to guidance as appropriate.","So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details around the quarter's ongoing businesses. Mark?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, David. Greetings, everyone and thank you for joining the call today. We're sharing a lot of news with you and I'd like to help you parse through it with a strong eye toward what all this means for our future.","First, let me say I'm pleased with our Q2 results, and how they reflect the benefits of the Q1 restructuring actions we took to improve our operating margin, broaden sales through our channel, leverage the integrations between NetScaler, XenApp and ShareFile and continued growth of our as-a-service offerings. The additional actions we're announcing today are designed to ensure we're directing more of our energy toward our core secure app and data delivery offerings, setting the company up for even better execution, greater efficiency and profitable growth.","Last month I began my 21st year on the Citrix team and my passion for our team, our partners and our customer vision is unwavering. A little more than one year ago when the board asked me to remain as CEO, I began to conclude that a simpler message, greater product focus, and operational efficiency would accelerate the realization of our strategy, a strategy to catch a paradigm shift where legacy PC era desktops are replaced by more flexible cloud era workspaces. Where IT is delivered as an on-demand service, and where solutions are centered around secure, consumer-like delivery of apps and data in an ever more hybrid world of devices, apps and people.","My full energy over the past year has been devoted to five primary goals. First, to establish a sustainable next generation strategy for the company, in the light of a rapidly changing customer industry and technology landscape. Secondly, to build around our core competencies to drive profitable, sustainable growth, and that's by eliminating, refocusing and optimizing Citrix around our core assets.","Third, to increase our focus on business and technical innovation by returning the company to thought leadership, differentiated solutions and operational excellence. Fourth, to protect and nurture our strong culture, which is critical for attracting, retaining and developing the talent we need. And fifth, to create a CEO succession plan with a goal of leadership continuity and suitability to the future. We've been making good progress, requiring many difficult and complex decisions, all by a leadership team of which I'm very, very proud.","In October last year, we began a three-phase process to reorganize, restructure and optimize the company. Since then, we have been acting thoughtfully and urgently to execute on many fronts, driving operational and strategic change and sequencing that change with sensitivity to employees, partners and customers. In just the past seven months, we completed a significant restructuring, introduced new leadership in sales, marketing, strategy and product development, all while launching new releases and innovations to our core products. So, we're in flight with a range of initiatives that continue to reinforce the progress we're making across the goals I outlined a year ago.","So here's what to expect next. First, further simplification of our customer value proposition through greater focus on our secure app and data delivery products. Secondly, improved focus on channel driven, low touch, high-margin sales. And third, ongoing improvements in operational efficiency. David discussed a number of the specifics in these areas, many of which have been in process, including the outcomes we expect over the second half. My goal for Citrix is to enter 2016 with the kind of focus, team, partners and momentum that will again set us apart when it comes to solutions for secured delivery of apps and data, with clear differentiation in user experience, information security, and flexibility for our customers.","Next I'd like to say just a few words about our channel-specific objective. As we've scaled to serve the world's largest governments and enterprises, the center of our go-to-market program has shifted away from the lower touch, higher profit revenue generated by the broader channel base we've historically served. We also believe we've under-exploited distribution partnerships around the globe that can increase our reach with lower go-to-market costs. So we're working to address our channel strategy, and we've hired a talented, worldwide channel success officer to spearhead all of this.","As I mentioned earlier, one of my key goals has been to create a CEO succession plan. Since the search for the right successor can take significant time, I've asked the board to begin that process now. This will allow me to continue to focus on the objectives I've outlined today without distraction and with confidence in the thoughtful transition process. My heart and soul are committed to making Citrix a success in this new chapter of our journey. I can assure you, I'll be intensely focused on driving us forward until we identify the best person to take the reins, however long that may take.","So in conclusion, the announcements we've made today will drive greater focus, effectiveness and efficiency. Way back in 2003, we made a bold decision to extend our Windows-based remote access franchise and completely reposition the company around a long-term value creation strategy based on a broader set of secure app and delivery solutions, addressing the breadth of customer needs across Windows, Linux, web and mobile.","So we're refocusing on that core strategy. As we look to the future, we clearly see a hyper-connected world and exploding variety of devices, greater application diversity, increased regulatory environments, and demand for consumer-like experiences. All of which have been drivers for the markets we serve. We are in a unique position to help our customers master this complexity just as we have for hundreds of thousands of customers over the last decade.","And now, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Philip Winslow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Just have two parts here. First, I know you guys don't break out license between NetScaler and the Xens anymore. But wondering if you can give us a sense for just the directionally what you were seeing in those this quarter, and any deviation from Q1? And just kind of what your thought process is when you gave guidance for the second half here. And then as far as some of the announcements made after the close here, you discussed obviously the online assets. Would that be including or excluding ShareFile when you discuss Citrix online and what is the rationale behind that? Thanks.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Hi, Phil. It's Mark. Let me take the GoTo question first. And as you saw in the release, really we're going to start with an exploration of the GoTo assets, which really the flagship is GoToMeeting, GoToTraining and GoToWebinar. We consider the delivery of data to be part of the core because delivery of apps and data are very adjacent to each other, common buyers and a lot of synergy there.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","And, Phil, on the first part of your question, the impact was largely driven by the networking business for the reasons that I outlined. On Workspace services, I'd refer back to my prepared comments where we've got a lot of good momentum on some of the newer initiatives, and we're moving in the right direction, and certainly the third or fourth quarter in a row that we're seeing better progression on a year-over-year basis. So we're happy with the progress.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thanks guys. And, Mark, congratulations on the next phase of your career here and it's really been a great ride. So thank you.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Phil. I've got, Phil, a lot of work to do until we find a successor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Nicole Hayashi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks. This is Nicole in for Heather. I just had a quick question about \u2013 a little more about the GoTo business and your plans there. What percent of this business \u2013 what percent of the revenue does this business represent, first of all? I think last time you said it was roughly 90% of the business?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","No, Nicole. We've broken it out in the past. I mean GoTo is the vast majority of what is represented by SaaS on our P&L.","Nicole Hayashi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. Thank you. And then I think just in terms of some of the sales changes that have happened over the last six months. Could you talk about where you are in that journey right now?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes. One of the things that I called out earlier, I think that we're adjusting to the changes that we made, all driving better focus on customers, partners, and the core solutions. So I'd say the teams have stabilized through this process. As Mark referenced, we've got more work and more focus that we're driving against our partners. So we've hired a brand new channel chief. And we're going to continue to march down that path through the second half of the year.","Nicole Hayashi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. David, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sales and marketing being down, I think it was 7% year-over-year. How much of that was related to head count and how much of that was related to perhaps shifting around or reduction in marketing and other spend that might not be calculated?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Walter, I'd say most of the actions that we've taken this year have been related to permanent costs. I'd say this is not simply a shifting of variable costs from place to place. We've talked a lot about the restructuring actions. And I will say that those have been across the enterprise side of our business. And in fact we've been investing incrementally into many of our SaaS based businesses. And so you're seeing a lot of the leverage, and really actually, all of the leverage coming out of the enterprise side and a lot of that through some of the sales and marketing initiatives that we've talked about, both in terms of just account coverage, channel coverage, the segmentation work that we've done, all focused on again driving better focus on the customer, better clarity in terms of the solutions, and higher productivity long-term.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then, David, also on, within the app virtualization or the app desktop virtualization business, any color \u2013 I know last year the kind of transactional XenApp business had been fairly challenged and you hadn't released a new product in a while, can you refresh that. I'm wondering if you can give us any sort of commentary on how that business is trending. And then also sort of qualitative color on XenMobile, which had been growing well ahead of that overall business and had been becoming a meaningful partner of that app delivery business?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Let me talk generally about those two pieces. So, in XenMobile we're happy with the progress that we're seeing on that front as well. We've had a couple of a really important product releases that we've talked about publicly in the past to be able to make it easier to adopt scale and manage these products. And we've got some large scale transactions. I'd say that we are seeing an increasing trend of the mobile solutions being consumed as part of the suite. I referenced that earlier where it wasn't a product a year ago, but has become quickly over 10% of the license mix for that group. So we are seeing more customers opting for the complete solution about delivering apps, whether they are Windows apps, web apps, mobile apps, et cetera. And that's why that solution is so differentiated.","In terms of the overall app and desktop business, there's a couple of things going on. One is that many of the more accessory or ancillary products that we have referenced in the past; we've been going through the process of portfolio optimization and I won't go back into those details, but as that has happened you'd imagine that the revenue streams that existed for those have been coming down, putting the headwind on the growth rate. So that's one thing that will normalize here before long.","Other than that, I mean the initiatives that we've talked about I think are moving in the right direction. Our CSP business, which many people equate to DAS, continues to do really well. That business is growing north of 20%. I think that that's also been impacted frankly by FX. So unit growth is substantially higher than that. And that's attacking a part of the market that we really haven't serviced in the past. So, happy with that. And then on the core XenApp, release 7.6 came out fairly recently. New feature pack at the end of the quarter bringing in some awesome new enhancements to user experience and security and many of those features. So, feeling pretty good about it.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. That's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you, guys. A lot of continued change that we're talking about in the business on a going forward basis. A question for David in terms of how we should think about the forward guidance. It seems like in this quarter you guys saw some continued disruption on the ByteMobile side of the business from the distraction of potentially spinning it off. To what extent are you looking for a similar type of distraction on the GoTo side of the business now that you've publicly announced that you're looking alternatives to their? I would guess that if we could see a similar type of disruption, is that accounted for explicitly in the guidance?","And then maybe a broader question of how are you guys looking to sort of manage the business and keep overall Citrix's focus now that we have Elliot Management on the board, and now that we're spinning out businesses, now that Mark has announced his intention to retire. How are you guys making sure that the overall business remains focused on good operation?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","It's quite a few questions in there, Keith, so let me just start at the top and work my way down. I'd say the first message is, everything we've been doing over the course of the last two or three quarters is focused on simplification, it's focused on the core markets, portfolio optimization and efficiencies. These all equate to a similar business model, easier to execute. In terms of the disruption, the SaaS businesses are largely targeting a different customer set than our core enterprise, right? So they have a different route to market, in many cases just different dynamics at play.","So \u2013 and the nature of simply being SaaS I would expect much less disruption to those businesses as we go through this process. ByteMobile is a little bit different because as you know we have taken the team out of the field where they used to reside, put them into a holistic unit and then go on through an examination process that has been very disruptive. So certainly don't expect that to be the case on the SaaS side.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Keith, the thing I would add is that we're executing to a pretty detailed plan that includes product roadmap, competitive strategy, building strength in various parts of the team. And shifting some of our weight across product lines in markets. And I've announced today that I've asked the board to begin a search for a successor, but I do expect that to take some time. And in the meantime, I am passionately and intensively leading this change and working in partnership with the best executive team ever with I think more clarity than ever around getting to our core, leveraging assets that are on board. Making them work better together and yielding that value in the marketplace through our partners where we've got plenty of innovation and excitement ahead over the next six months.","So there's lots for the team to focus on that will be exciting because it'll be exciting for partners and customers because of the value that we'll be delivering.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Stephen DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Mark and David, you say you're going to focus on secure app delivery. And as David just noted, the GoToMeeting or the GoTo product family, even though it focuses on app delivery, it's really different user set. And I guess you've already had engagement for third parties for potential sale of ByteMobile. But when I look at all this and some of our previous discussions as to how the GoTo fits in with everything, I'm just curious are there any other products or family of products that might not fit in that \u2013 in how you're simplifying this secure app delivery sort of vision today versus yesterday? Like for instance, the network acceleration business, it certainly saw your vision when you actually purchased that and get into that business. But at the same time, and it does contribute but at the same time it does seem like it could be separate. Is that something \u2013 might we think of any other businesses that might be separated going forward?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","John, I'd say two things. So, first of all, as I've said on prior calls, we've been optimizing the portfolio, including taking some low-performing products to their end of life and end of sale. And that's a continuous process that we've done. And we're well down the road with a lot of that. So we're always doing that, so that's sort of point number one. Point number two, we're not going to speculate about any other piece of the business because frankly, we think the other pieces of the business are at the core. So you talk about \u2013 I think you mentioned NetScaler in the context of app acceleration. It's actually we consider it to be the parallel technology to XenApp only for web apps. That's exactly why we acquired the company back in 2006.","Whereas, NetScaler provides the kind of performance, which is about user experience, the kind of security, which is about protecting the web app, and the kind of economics, which is about really being able to have a much more efficient backend system to run the web app. And those are exactly the same value propositions for a web-based app as XenApp delivers to a Windows app.","So we consider in ourselves now getting back to that core of app delivery and data delivery. And app networking is an essential part of it. I mean the way I think of it is the world's largest down to the world's smallest web apps are delivered by NetScaler. I do think that there are segments of the market that we can perform better in. And I think we have a plan to do that. I don't want to outline that right now because it is a very competitive market. And I don't want to tip our hands to our competitors at this point.","John Stephen DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Okay, Mark. That makes sense. If I might, Mark, just one follow-up sort of a question for you. Sort of higher level about the whole desktop business and frankly \u2013 what I'm really focused on is what was once called VDI, no one likes to use that. You don't hear it as much anymore because it didn't really take off. But frankly it all made sense. When you guys sort of painted that vision, it all made sense. It just seems to me and it seemed to me at the time that the world just wasn't ready for it and what I'm talking about are just think about the networking technology and storage technology, the cost of those and also the performance of those. What was really required to make this user experience satisfactory and make the cost reasonable just didn't seem to be there yet. But those technologies continue to improve out there. And your part of it and the networking technology, too, right?","But I'm just curious, are you \u2013 it doesn't feel like we're there yet. But I'm just wondering if there will be a time when people will sort of shy away from like this concept of VDI a little bit, at least in the investment community. But I wonder if there's a time when you know what, it does make sense for the masses to start to adopt something like that and maybe we call it something different because people like to call it different, when it maybe didn't work out as well as we thought the first time around. Are we getting there or is there something like that in the future perhaps?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","John, I love how you formed your question. I'd say this that we continue to believe that virtual apps and desktops, whether they are Windows-based, or Linux-based, continue to be a great opportunity for us. We have leading share. We have leading technology. And it's a marketplace that has definitely evolved. Now, specifically, the VDI marketplace has been very tepid because of the costs involved in storage and in compute. That is changing, partially via what our partners are doing, but a lot of the innovations that we've directed at that problem. And so, yes, there is a potential for that marketplace, including new use cases that are driven by some of the innovations that we introduced in the spring time at synergy around 3D graphics, capabilities, hosting synergy really rich apps in the cloud, being able to imbed those in line. There are just a tremendous number of possibilities there. And so I think we're \u2013 we believe in that market. Believe in the investments we're making. And it's likely as you look forward, and you imagine how people work, a desktop or an individual Windows app is probably a large \u2013 a smaller piece of how someone gets their work done. And that's why we've invested in the delivery infrastructure for web apps, for mobile apps, Linux apps, and the data that goes with them and to do that from end to end in a secure way.","So, what you'll see us do is go where the growth in those areas are. That's reflected in the value, the core value proposition of app virtualization. And the value proposition is pretty straightforward. TCO, security, device independence and management efficiency. And so any sectors that have a significant mix of legacy devices, legacy apps, have a high cost of a security breach and have a user population where they don't actually control the endpoint. Those are rich opportunities for us and you'll see us attacking those very more \u2013 with a lot more focus through how we go-to-market, our partnerships, how we package and price product et cetera. So we're being really thoughtful I think and aggressive in how we grow that business.","John Stephen DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the SaaS business. You mentioned that you're very early in process. But what might be your thoughts on use of proceeds from any divestiture that might occur down the road?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Hey, Steve. It's David. It's really too early to speculate on that. We'll provide updates as appropriate in the future.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And in terms of Citrix, Workspace, Cloud, you really have been kind of been driving towards the launch of that product and kind of re-orientating the business around it. I'm assuming that still remains a commitment that that is still an important product initiative and when you talk about possible future changes to the channel that you might be thinking about better a lining some partners around that. Can you talk about that a little bit?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Absolutely, Steve. We felt on this call that we should focus on the performance in the quarter and the range of announcements that we've made. But I'm happy to pontificate on Workspace cloud to keep it brief. We're \u2013 it's going to go live in Q3 as we've \u2013 as planned and promised. We're very excited about it. The pilots are exciting. The partners are excited. And we think that this becomes the core way that our partners will transact and conduct business with us providing the control plane and some of the complex aspects of secure app and data delivery and where they can focus on solutions and connecting to business problems and business opportunities. So, yeah, it's full speed ahead on Workspace cloud.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Terrific and congrats on a great run there, Mark. Thanks.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. It's Raimo here. Can you hear me?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes, Raimo, we can.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Sorry I don't know how I got a new name? Raimo was too complicated anyway. Two quick questions. First of all, can you talk a little bit about how you think the mobility space will evolve with kind of Microsoft making more noise, it's been a good partner for you for quite a while. They obviously are slightly unique in what they do, but they're starting to make more noise. How will that change the environment in the market? And then I had one follow-up question.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Raimo, I think that Microsoft's work in the market will actually catalyze and grow the primary market more rapidly than smaller players have been able to do that. So I think that's the primary impact of Microsoft's focus on it. I think the second thing is because of all of the mobile app management players out there, only one has a tight and strong relationship with Microsoft, and that's Citrix. So it has great potential for partnering. And just as we did in desktop virtualization, we'll have an opportunity to do that more and more and more going forward with Microsoft in the enterprise mobility space.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then one follow-up, David, for you, on the gross margin side, we've been talking for a while that the gross margin will improve because we have a positive mix effect from more desktop less NetScaler. If I look at the results this quarter, where you obviously came out better than you kind of talked about, is that already the fact that you've been talking about or were there other drivers at work? Thank you.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","No, Raimo, I think that's exactly right. As we've been saying that we would expect it to plateau in this 84%, 85% range and so we're a little bit ahead of that in Q2 based on mix. One of the things in our guidance is expect to have a stronger networking quarter on a relative basis than we did in Q2. And so I wouldn't be surprised if gross margin declined a little bit sequentially, but I expect it to remain generally in this range going forward.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Lovely. Thank you. I might think about the new name.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kasthuri G. Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. I actually like the name Raimo and my suggestion would be that you should look at Raimo's name, you should look at the analysts that have the longest questions on this conference call, you should consider for the CEO position.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Good to hear you, Kash.","Kasthuri G. Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a funny comment. It would not hurt to have a friend as the next CEO, although Mark, you were a friend, for the next CEO to be a sell side analyst would be a nice thing from my perspective. It'd be good to have another friend, so anyway, getting to more serious aspects of the business. Can you \u2013 you've really piqued my interest on this new channel strategy comment. How do you see the channel strategy looking like the next 12 months? What are the things that you envision Citrix doing differently? Because you've been a very channel-friendly company in the past obviously, but do you recognize something needs to change. If you can expand on that.","And also, secondly, the EUC share gains that VMware had, any thoughts on how you plan to reverse that? Thank you. That's it for me.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Kash. So, all right, first, I'd say, our, as we've really developed the marketplace for especially Windows app delivery, we've focused more and more and more on the largest customers and largest transactions and the partners that actually drive those, including some of our own efforts around our named account program. And I think what I was referring to in my prepared comments is that we've done that not because it's wrong but to the exclusion or \u2013 and really not get \u2013 staying focused on the partner and the customer that are in the land, expand, middle market, sort of that end of the spectrum, the spectrum that actually we have been so strong in for so many years. And so the focus of our channel programs have already begun.","If you look at how we reorganized the Americas, we've separated the direct touch field organization from what we call the commercial organization. The commercial organization is 100% focused on driving business through and with partners, where partners actually lead the business. We think that we can modify and optimize our partner program to actually incentivize those partners even more. And also give them some new products that will be very consistent with how they like to go to market and provide simpler solutions for the smaller and mid-market type customer. So, that's what you'll see us do. And frankly, it's kind of the answer to the second question as well because where we see softness in that part of the business, in the EUC area of the business, is at that end of the marketplace. And we think the combination of channel programs, plus Citrix Workspace cloud, plus some yet-to-be-announced exciting things that we'll wait on, we think that that's how we can actually compete more aggressively there. And reclaim lost ground at that end of the market.","Kasthuri G. Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Awesome. My very best wishes.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jim R. Moore - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Thanks. This is actually Jim Moore in for Dan Ives. Can you actually just talk a little about the competitive landscape on the NetScaler front with the cloud specifically and I guess what changes you might have seen now versus like a year ago?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Jim, it's David. I'll take that. In terms of the cloud segment, I wouldn't say there's competitive changes there, it's more of a timing issue that we've described in prior periods. If you recall we had a very strong performance in the first half of last year that created some really difficult comps. Going into this year, we thought it was going be a bit more balanced. And that's what we're seeing; certainly saw that in Q1 and Q2. I've described the percent of the mix that has come from that cloud service provider segment in the past. So, no change competitively, but certainly change in just the overall timing of what is a highly concentrated market.","Jim R. Moore - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I'd say \u2013 one follow up I'd add is that the enterprise segment of course is highly competitive and that's one where I mentioned that we're growing in the high-single digit range. And so we're making good progress there and I think that's a combination of the solution sales where we are \u2013 be able to create a differentiated solution by leveraging capabilities of NetScaler and virtualization together, by being able to leverage our installed base to a greater and greater degree, et cetera. And so that business continues to grow. It represented the majority of NetScaler in the second quarter.","Jim R. Moore - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Katherine Egbert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Katherine R. Egbert - Piper Jaffray & Co","Hi. Good afternoon. You put up a really nice result in terms of operating margins far exceeding what you've done in this period in the past. But you didn't update guidance for the year. I mean is it safe to assume that you're still going to be over 100 bps for the year? And how much more can it be?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Katherine, it's \u2013 we didn't give a guide here because it's clear that our current guidance is substantially ahead of the target we set out. So I mean we're in the beginning of what we believe to be a multi-year expansion of margins. We've talked about that a few times. We are very focused on driving efficiencies throughout the business, not just this year but over a protracted period. So, we're not planning on updating the number. But just looking at where consensus will shake out with our current guidance, it'll put you north of 24% for 2015.","Katherine R. Egbert - Piper Jaffray & Co","Right. Okay. How big is ByteMobile? It sounds like that one is maybe the closest to being sold?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Katherine, we haven't broken out the contribution from that and really since the acquisition. So, upon the conclusion of this process we'll provide an update to guidance and the numbers as appropriate.","Katherine R. Egbert - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay. And then last question. How do \u2013 I just wanted to ask this before, but just to put a fine point on it, I mean how do you sort of stay focused both internally but also how do you keep your partners engaged given what's going on with company and the three press releases today? How do you keep resellers and customers engaged when I think a natural thought is, is Citrix going to be the same as it is a year from now or two years from now or will you be independent?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Actually, Katherine, I see this exactly opposite. I think that this is a case where the message that we're sending to our customers and our partners is that we're absolutely focused on the core, the core of secure app delivery. One of the things that has come from partners and customers in the past, just making sure they understand the clarity of our strategy, the clarity of vision and innovation. And really this whole process through this year has been about simplifying that, focusing that and reminding everybody of the tremendous assets we have around products like XenApp and NetScaler.","Katherine R. Egbert - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay. Thank you. And, Mark, congratulations.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Katherine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","S. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks very much. David, you might have addressed this on the prepared remarks, and I missed it, but Asia-PAC, I guess was there any impact on the business from a stronger dollar? Or is that mainly just operational, it being down I think around 8% this quarter?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Kirk, less from FX and more just operational and continued challenges in certain markets.","S. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then just one other question. Just in terms of the SaaS business. I know obviously GoTo and ShareFile were kept separate for a long time. I believe there was some combining of sort of some operations and management. Has that been I guess re-separated out as you look at that? I'm just trying to get a sense on how, I guess, potentially disruptive it would be to separate the two from one another. I realize they sort of started out separate, but can you just give us an update on that?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Kirk. The \u2013 generally both products are built on separate platforms so that they're not inextricably intertwined from a release cycle perspective. And so I think there are lots of degrees of freedom here around not only how we imagine a potential strategic alternative, but also how we imagine further integrations with our Windows, Linux et cetera mobile side of the business, as well as on the other side. So I think they are separate platforms. That's how they're built.","S. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Great and best of luck in terms of your next steps, Mark.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thanks so much, Kirk.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Two questions. The first one is with the new focus on channel, how much of the revenue is channel driven now? What do you think you'd like it to be? And then I have a follow-up.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, Mark, our channel driven \u2013 our channel fulfilled revenue on the enterprise side of the business is somewhere in the high 90% range in terms of how it's delivered, through distribution, through a channel partner. What we're talking about here is really adding focus to increase revenue through the broader channel that services smaller and mid-market companies, and with the same product set that we have. So that's how the mix works. But one sort of dimension is how we actually drive the business where we're touching the customer and the partner is following through with the fulfillment. But at the other end of the marketplace, the partner is really driving and touching the customer, and we're supporting them with the right kinds of incentives and programs for fulfillment. So really that's what we're talking about when we talk about refocusing and optimizing our partner program.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. Can you also give us some more color on APAC and Pacific, and what was going on there?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","I'd say the biggest change on a year-over-year basis has been business in China as well as business in kind of greater ANZ has been moving more towards subscription and CSV. A little combination of those two factors. We also had a couple of large transactions in Q2 a year ago which created a little bit more of a difficult comp.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Perfect. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I just had a follow-up to a prior question. David, you said earlier your enterprise ADC business grew 8% this quarter, although I believe it had consistently been growing quite a bit higher than that. Is there anything that you would call out here that could be behind the deceleration this quarter? And also just how are you thinking about the growth prospects specifically for enterprise ADC going forward?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Gregg. It does move around depending on the quarter and what the comp looks like. And the good news is this business continues to grow nicely. And I think that it's a competitive market and it'll continue to be. The underlying market growth rates, I think you can pull those from the industry analysts, but we've got a good position and I think we've got a lot of really good assets to go drive, whether that's our installed base, our optimizations of the virtualization and mobile products, et cetera. And so I think we're optimistic about the capabilities there and are going to keep driving it.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And just a quick follow up, just wondering what the approximate timeframe by which the newly formed operations committee would hope to complete their initial review?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","No timeframe mentioned right now. As appropriate we'll come back to all shareholders.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Thanks. I've got two. One a follow-up to the question just asked, not so much about the timing of the operations committee but more if you could expand on the mandate and scope of that committee. Are we talking about a fresh look at cost cutting, or will that committee also evaluate what assets Citrix should keep in its portfolio beyond the decision to divest the go to business? And I guess fundamentally how does the work of this committee differ from the restructuring review that you and the team made last year and started implementing early this year? Thank you.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure. At a high level the role of the committee is around operations and capital. And really what that means is working closely with management on the next phase of our growth in evolution. I think we're all very much aligned in terms of opportunities to grow efficiencies, to grow shareholder value, and we'll be working on the best way to do that. I think it's really that simple.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then my follow up is just on the second half revenue guidance. I realize that this is \u2013 Citrix is more of a cost turnaround story, but just on the top line guidance you mentioned that you are mindful of the short term disruption from all of these actions but the guide still requires the total revenue growth to accelerate somewhat in the second half. And David, maybe you could just outline a couple of the reasons that you feel confident that it can? Thanks.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure. I think the biggest reason is that we're seeing incrementally better progress over the last several quarters. We're moving in the right direction on a number of these things. And then the primary headwinds that we have called out, whether it's ByteMobile or the Cloud service providers or others should abate as we look into the second half.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Mark or David, we don't get to hear much about your mobile solutions from the field as much, but it seems to be performing in line to better than your internal expectations. Can you discuss your go to market strategy in the space and how you're planning to expand your reach? Is it currently an install-base play or are you trying to reach out to new customers as well?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","The answer is both. To this point, it's been very much an install-base play where we have very close relationships with customers around the conversation that occurs around app and data delivery. So it's a very natural incremental and adjacent conversation to have with them. In terms of new customers, and there \u2013 while we have a huge base, there's still many, many new customers that are out there for us. And we see that on the mobile side the primary vector there is through the Workspace Cloud and making the XenMobile capabilities available through Workspace Cloud through our partners that really specialize in the small and mid-market segments.","So that would be where we'd see incremental opportunity going forward, especially as Workspace Cloud really reduces the sort of technical skills required to stand up a full Workspace environment. That includes the ability to deliver Windows apps and desktops, Linux apps and desktops, mobile apps and all the data that goes with them as well. So that's where we see a potential greenfield for the business going forward.","Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And, Mark, congrats and good luck for the next chapter of your life, but quick question on that. Is there a time line to look for the new CEO and how will the search process be different this time versus the last time in terms of the experience the board is looking for in the new leader? Thanks. That's it for me.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","There's \u2013 thanks for the question and the kind comment. There's no timeline as you know on these kinds of processes. You can't define them by time. They have to be defined by outcome and a successful outcome, finding the right successor. And the committee is just getting started. And we're talking about \u2013 I'm not on the committee \u2013 but talking about what the profile might be, et cetera.","And in the meantime, while I appreciate everyone's remarks and congratulations, I can promise you I'm intensely passionate about what we're doing and driving forward whatever time that takes, because I want the board to have plenty of time. I mean I think one of the things that I learned from the last search is that the amount of time that it took and I ended up obviously retaining my role, but it does show that succession is a tough and difficult process that you have to be very thoughtful about and we don't have any time constraints on it.","Abhey R. Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. David, you've got pretty easy license comps in the back half. I'm just curious how you're thinking about returning to growth on license? And then just tying into that I was curious if you're seeing in some of the contract composition your customers taking these contracts over time versus the traditional upfront and seeing the recurring shift bursting across the industry towards subscription over time versus the upfront?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Brett, I agree with you. I think that we're obviously focused on growing the business and a lot of the headwinds that prevented that in the last four, five quarters are things that we're working to move away. And so I'm happy with that progress. In terms of the overall contracts we have seen a bit more of a shift towards longer-term arrangements. It's not tremendous, but I called that out in deferred revenue. We've seen this for a few quarters now. And all the growth in long-term deferred revenue is simply related to customers that want to engage in multiple years of license updates or maintenance contracts or in some cases term licenses.","We will manage the whole subscription evolution with Citrix Workspace Cloud et cetera towards more consumption. But at this point we really believe those are addressing net new markets more than a transition market. So that's certainly the way to think about it in the short term.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So you don't see the traditional model changing anytime soon?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Not rapidly.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James. Your line is open.","James Wesman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. It's James Wesman sitting in for Michael. Mark, can you talk about deal sizes in the quarter? I believe last quarter that had been a bit of a struggle, and so I was curious if you give us more color on if those deal sizes recovered and if this is a function of the sales reorg settling?","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yes. I think David can give you some data, but clearly relative to Q1, closing large deals was much simpler and more straightforward than in Q1 in the midst of the restructuring. We've seen a lot of settling down in the sales in the field organization. As a reminder, in Q2 we still had some of that restructuring work going on in certain countries that require up to three or more months of notice. And so we're delighted with the strategic end of the business, that is the seven and above figure deals that we were able to close.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","James, specifically when we talk about that as referring to the larger transactions, not across the entire board, but of the large transactions, the average transactions size increased between 5% and 10% year-on-year and north of 40% sequentially.","James Wesman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And one follow up, Dave. Just on the Cloud service provider business inside of NetScaler, I know you'd mentioned it was down about 40% year-over-year this quarter. Do you guys feel going forward that this has flattened out? And can you talk about your outlook for this piece of the NetScaler business for the rest of the year?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's a difficult one to forecast exactly the timing of the transactions because they're predicated on a handful of extremely large companies doing data center buildouts largely related to new services that they're rolling out. And so it does track that fairly closely. The strategy of our business has been to continue to expand largely the enterprise and that's the area that continues to grow. And so the volatility of this becomes less and less overall. We work very closely with these partners to make sure we understand the requirements. In some cases, putting together unique capabilities as required. And that helps us stay out in front of the roadmap.","James Wesman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open.","Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. David, you called out Workspace Suite gaining some traction. I'm just curious, is there still a focus on the Trade-up program to drive engagements or are there other routes to market or tactics you're taking that give you some increased confidence on attach going forward?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Sure, Derrick. I think it's both. I mean it's obviously we'll engage with customers if there's opportunities to take an existing customer and migrate them to a more holistic solution that includes mobile and data and some things like that. We'll obviously drive that, but as you'd imagine, a lot of the focus is on addressing net new customers or what would be net new seats and opportunities inside of existing customers. So it's got to be both.","Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Then I think you've shared some of this at past Analyst Days, but can you give us some color on the gross margin profile of the GoTo business?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, we haven't really broken that out since the annual look that we do on our Analyst Day. But in general last time it was in the mid-70%s.","Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Zeller from Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. I may have missed earlier but looking for a NetScaler specific number within the networking group, how did NetScaler perform year-on-year?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, NetScaler is down year-on-year for the reasons that we referenced earlier. They are largely driven by the SSP engagement \u2013 or I'm sorry, we call it service provider segment and the enterprise segment grew. That's the way to think about NetScaler.","Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback from Stifel.

David, can you give us a sense of how much cash flow the GoToMeeting business generates?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","No. We actually haven't broken that out in the past. We'll have to hold that until we get further into the process.","Brad R. Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Is there any reason to think that it's materially different than the revenue contribution?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Again, we haven't broken it out in the past and so I would just \u2013 I'd caution you to wait until we get further down in the process.","Brad R. Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then I'm not sure if it's for you or for Mark. Ten weeks ago at Synergy we heard how instrumental GoToMeeting was. Today we hear about it being a, in essence, discontinued asset. What's changed?","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Well, I think that at Synergy we talked about GoToMeeting in the context of being one of our product lines. It's not actually bundled into, for example, XenMobile. ShareFile is part of XenMobile. We're very proud of GoToMeeting and what we've done to build that brand and that business. And I think that what we've seen is that in that marketplace, on the enterprise side it is really a marketplace that's dominated by Microsoft with Lync and Skype for Business, and certainly Cisco has some products in that area. And we feel that GoToMeeting has its core and its strength in SMB markets, in premium SMB markets and verticals, which is really not very synergistic with our enterprise delivery infrastructure business. So our perspective has changed on it as we look at where we should be investing more and less.","And as we've said on the prepared comments, we think that the potential for value creation with the GoTo family can be greater if it's operated without the constraints of enterprise software business model. SaaS-based models, like especially in the GoTo area, will operate at half the operating margin that we need as an enterprise software company. And that constrains that kind of business at a time when it needs investment to drive growth in what is a very competitive market. So that's our thinking on it and why we're looking at the strategic alternatives.","Brad R. Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Rizzuto from SunTrust. Your line is open.","David James Henshall - Citrix Systems, Inc.","John?","Mark B.

Your line is open.","Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC","Oh, great. Thank you very much. I'm just wondering how you managed this transition when you're going be retiring and a new CEO will come in. How much leeway will the new person have in terms of implementing his own strategic ideas and building the team that he wants around him? Or her, I should add? Thank you.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Yeah, thank you, Pat. When you transition leadership you're looking for a level of continuity and suitability to the future. And so one of the dimensions we have to look at is someone that understands the market spaces we're in and can bring in a point of view, and then enable that person as CEO to do what they need to do. When the baton was handed to me many, many years ago, our first CEO Roger Roberts told me \u2013 gave me some advice. And he said the best advice I can give you is make it your own. And that really means don't think about decisions in terms of how would Roger make this decision. But in fact, what do I believe. And that's what I've done and that's what I expect we will enable the successor to do.","And then I don't think it's any secret amongst all of you listening, you spend 21 years of your life, but the privilege I've had on this team over 21 years \u2013 this is a bit \u2013 the way I spell work is L-O-V-E around here. And that means that I'll be available at the request of a new CEO and to help in any way that person wishes, and because I'm \u2013 I've been in it for the long run and I'm going to stay in it for the long run even though I might be in a very, very different role.","Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for that perspective.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Pat.","Mark B. Templeton - Citrix Systems, Inc.","Okay.

David?","David James Henshall","Thanks, Eduardo, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As you can see from the release, overall results were very solid in Q2, including $730 million in total revenue, up 19% year-on-year; $227 million in product license, up 21%; 24% annual growth in deferred revenue; cash flow from ops of 25%; and adjusted EPS of $0.66 a share.","In Q2, we closed 46 transactions greater than $1 million each compared to 39 a year ago, with relative strength coming from customers in the financial services, telco, healthcare and retail sectors. Geographically, we are continuing to see uneven capital spending across our various markets. Business in the Americas was generally solid throughout the quarter, with balanced execution across the product areas. In total, 2\/3 of the strategic multimillion dollar orders were from this geo, leading to total revenue growth to 24% year-on-year.","In EMEA, revenue is up 16%, led by strong expansion in the networking business as private investments to expand market coverage are delivering good returns. And finally, revenue from the Pacific and Japan regions increased 10% from a year ago, impacted by tough comps from Q2 2012.","Next, I'd like to highlight the results within our 3 primary markets. First, in our Mobile & Desktop business, revenue grew 11% from last year to $382 million, including a 2% increase in product license. In Q1, we introduced XenMobile MDM, providing CIOs with a solution to enable mobile work styles with device and app management.","Last month, we expanded the solution with the release of XenMobile Enterprise Edition, which delivers an integrated product that addresses mobile devices, app and data management, along with secure e-mail, Web and other productivity tools, really a differentiated solution.","The business is in a transition right now as mobile has quickly become a top priority for CIOs. The topic is leading to a lot of strategic conversations with brand new customers where engagements will most likely start with XenMobile and then pull through after desktop virtualization as the customer addresses the broader requirements of enabling mobile work styles, BYO, workshifting, data security and other initiatives.","We're seeing significant XenMobile pipeline developing, up over 40% sequentially, and we're very comfortable with our full year goals for this solution. However, this ramp is having a near-term impact on the standalone desktop virtualization sales and sales productivity as we've shifted focus to building up this business. We do believe that the impact should moderate over the next few quarters as our sales teams and partners get more comfortable selling the combined solutions.","In the Mobile & Desktop business, in total, there were 19 $1 million-plus transactions in Q2, representing customers in financial services, telco, technology, healthcare and other verticals. Additionally, more than $20 million of the sequential increase in deferred revenue was related to these solutions.","Some good examples of how customers, during the quarter, are utilizing these technologies as a way to accelerate their business imperatives included a financial services firm that purchased over 50,000 desktop virtualization seats to reduce their application delivery costs, increase the flexibility of their infrastructure and enable mobile options. Or a pharmaceutical company, enabling over 10,000 salespeople to migrate to tablets to access several lines of business apps. Or a leading energy company utilizing XenMobile and NetScaler SDX together to secure personal and corporate devices for employees in the field while delivering apps securely through a single app store. Or finally, a major retail chain in the Pacific that is part of a project to adopt web-based productivity tools, purchased 20,000 DV licenses to deliver their traditional Windows applications across different devices. We're increasingly talking to customers about business enablement, reducing the cost of their app and desktop infrastructure and increasing productivity by enabling enterprise mobility options.","Next, in our Networking & Cloud business. We really performed well in Q2, with total revenue increasing 46% to $165 million, including product license revenue that was up 54%. The NetScaler products were again the major driver of growth in the quarter. In addition to very strong growth from the buildout of public clouds in cloud services, we continue to leverage NetScaler as part of delivering integrated solution to our enterprise accounts. For example, the cross-sell and attach initiatives led to more than 550 desktop virtualization orders that included NetScaler as part of their solution, and this is up about 20% from a year ago. We transacted with over 2,000 different customers in the period compared with only 1,500 last year as we worked to expand the base. This includes 1,000 net new networking customers, many of which adopted VPX virtual appliances. And from a mix perspective, the NetScaler SDX platform really stood out in Q2, representing 20% of NetScaler license sales and increasing well over 100% year-on-year. SDX is differentiated in the market, running up to 40 independent instances, including third-party services on a single appliance, delivering real customer benefits like multi-tenancy and consolidation within the datacenter.","And finally in emerging products. Bytemobile continues to ramp. While it contributed less than 10% of networking product in the period, we're focused on expanding the customer base which drives long-term revenue growth. An example of this included a new multiyear, multimillion dollar contract with a large mobile network operator in the Pacific region. But consistent with many opportunities in this business, the revenue from this specific contract will be billed and recognized over an extended period of time, so very little impact in the actual Q2 results.","So next, with our collaboration and data business. SaaS revenue was up 15%. The GoToMeeting family continues to be the primary driver, growing 21% in Q2. Additionally, ShareFile, our data sharing platform, is ramping well, up 75% from last year.","Looking forward, the opportunity with ShareFile is expanding as we address enterprise requirements through new innovations like StorageZone Connectors for SharePoint, network drives, Microsoft Azure, as well as tight integration across our mobility solutions.","Turning to operations. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 86%, down 1.5% from a year ago as the mix of new product revenue reflects the success we're having in the Networking business. We do expect this trend to continue over the next few quarters, leading to adjusted gross margin for the full year between 86% and 86.5%.","During Q2, we added 228 new people to Citrix as we focus on expanding go-to-market reach and customer direct touch primarily to drive our opportunity in networking. Additionally, we've been investing to expand the data sharing and the mobile platform teams.","And finally, the adjusted tax rate was 22%, up from 8% a year ago. And as a reminder, last year, the tax calculation included benefits of approximately $22 million or $0.11 a share, primarily related to the closing of IRS audits for certain tax years.","Looking at the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased to $1.5 billion at the end of June. We repurchased over 600,000 shares of stock in Q2, bringing the first half buyback to nearly 2 million shares. Cash flow from ops was more than $200 million, up 25% from last year, and deferred revenue increased $40 million sequentially and 24% year-on-year.","So turning to our current outlook and expectations for the second half of 2013. Overall, we executed really well in Q2. Though it's reasonable to expect demand levels to remain mixed across our various markets, activity metrics like pipeline and POC have remained strong. We're very confident in our core business strategies and the investments we're making in enterprise mobility, collaboration, cloud and networking. We'll continue to focus on delivering financial results while investing to expand our long-term capacity and differentiation across these areas.","So for the full year 2013, we're modestly increasing expectations for total revenue and EPS based on the strength of Q2. For 2013, expectations are now for total revenue to be in the range of $2.96 billion to $2.98 billion, adjusted gross margin of approximately 86% and adjusted EPS between $3.09 and $3.11 per share. And for the third quarter 2013, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $740 million and adjusted EPS of $0.72 to $0.73 a share.","So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to give you additional details on the quarter's performance and discuss our ongoing businesses. Mark?","Mark B. Templeton","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our overall Q2 performance and proud of our strategic and financial results. We're executing well on product, go-to-market and partnership investments to drive growth in business mobility and cloud infrastructure.","In the bigger picture, Q2 was a continuation of the Q1 environment, with uneven capital spending, especially in European markets. And just like in Q1, we accelerated our focus on leading the market for mobile work styles. We felt solid metrics in opportunity pipeline growth, especially for mobility solutions, in the growth of strategic consulting services that support large and multiproduct deals and in share gains across cloud networking, data sharing and collaboration markets. These elements are critical to the success of our segment-specific and overall business strategy, serving markets that are estimated to grow to $16 billion by 2015.","A huge highlight for Q2 included the unveiling of important new products and partnerships at our Synergy Conference in Los Angeles, all designed to support our trust in solutions for mobility, cloud networks and SaaS services.","So next, I'd like to highlight how we're continuing to evolve our innovation, go-to-market and partnerships going forward. First, let's focus on our mobility business. XenMobile and XenDesktop 7, released in late Q2, uniquely position Citrix to provide a complete mobility solution across any type of app, any type of data, any type of device. Our enterprise sales teams and partners are focusing on the whole solution, introducing XenMobile into our XenDesktop customer base and doing a really effective job of depositioning competitive endpoint solutions. This is resulting in record pipeline built, larger scale customer engagements and initiating new account relationships.","The introduction of XenMobile Enterprise Edition is the catalyst of these conversations, establishing the bar in the enterprise mobility market with MDM, mobile apps, virtual desktops, secured docks and mobile support as the standard. More than 2\/3 of our customers are opting for the Enterprise Edition, which also connects beautifully to XenDesktop and XenApp. It also includes secure mail, browsing and documents powered by our WorxMail, WorxWeb and ShareFile apps. The Worx-enabled app ecosystem is also a powerful differentiator, enabling over 100 third-party mobile business apps to be securely delivered by XenMobile.","We're getting important early recognition for our innovations and thought leadership. Recently, Citrix received the top ranking by Gartner on the critical capability survey for MDM, where Citrix led in all 5 categories. And Gartner ranked Citrix as the market leader in the MDM Magic Quadrant. So with a fast-growing opportunity pipeline, technology leadership, industry momentum and go-to-market intensity, we like our position in enterprise mobility going into the second half of the year.","Now let's shift to the desktop business. David mentioned earlier, we saw a continued momentum in a number of large deals, reflecting our ongoing strategic presence with enterprise customers. The announcement and release of XenDesktop 7 was not only a Q2 highlight, it represents the reimagining of Windows desktop and app virtualization, reimagined for the mobile-centric, cloud-driven enterprise. This major new release brings virtual desktops and apps under a single infrastructure, optimized for private, public and hybrid cloud environments. It includes new HDX mobile technologies that provide a native style multitouch mobile user experience over any network, including less capable networks like 3G. HDX mobile also radically improves mobile video performance and reduces network utilization. XenDesktop 7 delivers a cloud-ready infrastructure for delivering Windows apps and desktops as a service from a single, easy-to-use console. We've dramatically reduced installation time, accelerated app migrations, streamlined operations management and reduced the cost of ownership. And XenDesktop 7 takes advantage of performance, cost saving and platform innovation in Microsoft's newest releases of Windows Server and System Center. We think it's a solid multiyear product cycle ahead as customers refresh their datacenter infrastructure, leverage hybrid clouds and build bridges to public clouds. We also think XenDesktop 7 further solidifies our position in key verticals, like health care and financial services, while opening new opportunities in more specialized app markets such as CAD, engineering, PON and multimedia design.","Customers will really appreciate new cost efficiencies we're achieving with Cisco, Dell, HP, IBM and NetApp, reducing datacenter hardware for VDI below $200 a user for the first time; and Synergy, NetApp and our solutions that can actually drop storage cost to as low as $30 per VDI user. With continued innovation and partnering, we're reducing virtual desktop cost to new levels, past the tipping point where enterprises can more easily see both business enabling benefits of mobilizing Windows apps and desktops, as well as the financial benefits of centralizing them. We're incredibly excited about this release, and the initial response from partners and customers has been phenomenal.","So we're delivering a complete enterprise mobility solution, allowing customers to bridge between the worlds of the Windows and mobility and to do it all within the integrated experience that sets Citrix apart.","Next, I'd like to talk about our collaboration and data sharing business. We're continuing to see excellent adoption of our mobile collaboration products. GoToMeeting is top-ranked among Web conferencing products and consistently ranks in the top 10 mobile apps for business across iOS and Android. GoToMeeting mobile apps have been downloaded nearly 5 million times.","Scheduling meetings directly from mobile devices now allows our users to have a completely mobile experience, confirming our mobile first strategy is working effectively. And in Q2, we launched a new \"all you can speak\" toll-free audio feature. It's an industry first and a valuable upsell feature for existing GoToMeeting customers.","We're also driving strong year-over-year growth in international markets where e-commerce is becoming a more pervasive route to market and a growth driver for us. In Q2, we announced a partnership with China Unicom, our second partner in China. We're an aggressive early entrant in that emerging market with the right partners to capture growth.","ShareFile had another amazing quarter of growth in both SMB and enterprise segments. We've closed some large ShareFile enterprise deals in Q2, including 7 that were 6-figure transactions. In Q2, we significantly enhanced ShareFile mobile apps with simple document editing and annotation. Now you can easily annotate and sign PDF files and even edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs right inside the ShareFile app on your iPad. The new release also supports secure mobile access to SharePoint and file server documents based on our new StorageZone's Connector Technology.","We're continuing to scale and drive ShareFile as a premier solution for secure business data sharing across both SMB and enterprise segments and as a core feature in our XenMobile product line.","Finally, I'd like to turn to our Networking & Cloud businesses. As David noted, the strongest business segment in the quarter was in cloud networking, where NetScaler grew over 50%. We're getting early payback from the significant investments we're making in our go-to-market capacity. In addition, we're benefiting from solid market drivers and NetScaler's unique software-defined architecture. This architecture is giving us great competitive advantage, product line breadth and market velocity. In fact, almost 1\/3 of the Q2 business was driven by customers adopting software-based, virtualized and multitenant form factors, like NetScaler VPX and SDX. Additionally, NetScaler continues to be a core component in XenDesktop and XenApp architectures, with a similar opportunity emerging as a de facto gateway for XenMobile ahead. And Bytemobile continues to bring us good growth and gives us a powerful base in the core network of mobile operators, many of whom are now also considering and adopting NetScaler.","Just a few weeks ago at the Cisco Live event, we reached the second milestone in our strategic relationship with Cisco: The announcement of Citrix NetScaler 1000V, available only from Cisco. With this, Cisco is leveraging NetScaler to seamlessly integrate into their overall datacenter services portfolio. Customers will get best-in-class capabilities of NetScaler fused into Cisco's virtual and datacenter Nexus fabrics. We're already driving new opportunities, as partners and customers proactively approach both companies on next-generation datacenter refreshes and new buildouts. We have some great Q2 joint wins with Cisco, and we expect the NetScaler 1000V to drive expanded partnering opportunity going into the second half of the year.","With the rapid growth and the understanding of software-defined networking, NetScaler is poised to continue to take share in this rapidly transforming market, driven by the edge we have in our core architecture.","Next, let's shift to CloudPlatforms. In the CloudPlatforms business, we continue to see both design wins and production scale-ups, especially in enterprise, education and telco market segments. Today, Citrix CloudPlatform, powered by Apache CloudStack, is in production in almost 200 clouds across the globe. Recently, the University of S\u00e3o Paulo created the largest IT cloud project in Latin America, filled with Citrix CloudPlatform and CloudPortal along with tight integrations to NetScaler and XenDesktop. The solution was the result of close collaboration between Cisco, Citrix, Microsoft and NetApp and emblematic of the kind of large-scale production-ready solutions our CloudPlatform is enabling.","In Q2, we also announced the release of XenServer 6.2 as a full-featured open source project. This significantly extends our open source strategy and brings cloud-ready features, openness and simplicity to XenServer. The new release dramatically increases scale and performance, with huge step-ups in DM density and support for platform enhancements in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. XenServer 6.2 also includes new optimizations for XenDesktop, with features like IntelliCache, Desktop Director alerts and Dynamic Memory Control to drive lower TCO and best-in-class performance. So overall, I'm really pleased with the execution in our Networking & Cloud businesses.","Looking forward, we really like the trends that are fueling our business. IT, as we've known, it is being reshaped by new definitions of work and computing: work is going mobile, computing is going cloud. This is the future of IT. This is how we'll capitalize on these better ways for people and IT to work. This is why we're confident in our fiscal and strategic plans, and this is precisely how we'll continue to increase our relative market position.","So next, I'd like to now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rob Owens.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Wanted to drill down a little bit into the desktop license line. If I look at the first half of the year, I think it's down about 5% on a year-over-year basis. Initially, when you guys kind of shape the year, I think you talked about flat to slightly up in the desktop biz for 2013, then you added on the XenMobile component. So maybe just help us understand, I think, there's some confidence towards the back half. But just what gives you that confidence, and if you're still kind of holding to that more organic flattish type of number for XenApp and XenDesktop this year.","David James Henshall","Sure, Rob, this is David. Let me take that question. Couple of things going on there. First, as we think about the mobile and desktop business, we know -- we are going to continue to report this as an aggregate number like we talked about last quarter. We're doing that simply because that's the way we're going to market, that's the way we're thinking about it and that's how the customer conversation is really happening right now. So we don't plan on breaking out the various components. So as we think about the entire business, there's a couple of things going on. Externally, Europe has been tough. That's probably the hardest area. Macro is certainly impacting that to a degree. But probably more specific than that, all the success and focus we were having around mobile as a topic has certainly impacted productivity of our sales teams and the focus on standalone desktop virtualization. More so than we would have anticipated, I'd say. So it's a double-edged sword. The good news is that these conversations are generating a tremendous amount of pipeline for mobile and desktop right now, and we expect that to moderate as a pressure over the balance of the year. So in terms of the actual guidance, as we look at the overall business, I think it does continue to accelerate as we get into the back half of the year. We're not going to be giving specific guidance at the product level, but I feel that -- I feel much better about the second half going forward. And certainly as the teams get more comfortable with the combined solution, then again, those pressures ought to moderate.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then I guess for Mark, on the strategic levels, you look at that combined solution, do you think you have all the components at this point? Is there other tuck-ins that you'd like to do as we look at that moving forward?","Mark B. Templeton","Rob, I think we feel really good about the end-to-end and the complete solution that we have. I think where we have a lot of intensity is in better integrations, smoother integrations and improving the user experience consistently. So we're on a pretty fast pace roadmap with a couple of releases between here and the end of January. So it's much more a focus on execution, integration and less on kind of pieces that are missing.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm curious if you could give us a sense of -- is there an easy way to frame the mobile impact to revenue or bookings for '13 given the excitement around the new product line? Or is this something that we're just going to have to kind of wait till '14 to get a little more granular on?","Mark B. Templeton","Yes, Brent. As far as the standalone revenue, I think that it's one of those things that, like I said, we won't break it out. When we did the acquisition, we talked about a number of $30 million of total revenue and we're extremely comfortable with that at this point. It's going to get harder and harder for us to segment that out in a way that actually adds value to the conversation, because, as I mentioned earlier, it really is a unified go-to-market and a unified conversation with our customer. In many cases, what's going on is that the excitement around mobile is starting with the devices or apps. And then as the customer gets more strategic in the conversation, they start looking at how do I deliver all of my app infrastructure. And in most cases, that means Win 32, and that brings in app and desktop virtualization. So I think it's going to be a continuum. We did see right out of the gate a handful of transactions, big in our top -- call them our top 25 transactions that included both XenMobile, XenDesktop and NetScaler as individual products and as part of the same project. So I think that's what we're going to see more and more going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just on the sales process here around XenMobile and XenDesktop. XenMobile, at least my understanding is that the ROI conversations that people might have had around XenDesktop don't occur, and it's a faster implementation, a faster sale. And despite sort of the current bump, say, in execution, is it fair to start thinking of this as that XenMobile could accelerate some of the growth in XenDesktop? Or are we being -- are we thinking too aggressively about that opportunity?","David James Henshall","Yes, Bhavan, I think you're absolutely right. The degree of which is to be determined. We'll talk about it over the next few quarters. But from a conversation standpoint, I mean the demonstrable ROI is right there. It's easy. It's a quick conversation and it's top of mind for CIOs. Probably mobile and security I'd say are the top 2 priorities right now. And so therefore, it's a really easy way to initiate a dialogue. A lot of transactions that I expect to open and close in -- even in the same quarters. So sales cycles are much, much lower and it's way -- as I said a couple of times, as you start that, the easy, simple conversation around devices or mobile apps, native mobile apps and then you can get those transactions done and initiate a longer-term relationship that brings in things like app and desktop virtualization, networking, et cetera. So it's a terrific entry point right now and we certainly feel good about it at the back half of the year and going into '14.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then, David, are you seeing similar interest for XenMobile in Europe? Because it feels like it's very North American-centric today. And sort of could it help the European business maybe gain some more traction given the challenges in that region?","David James Henshall","Yes, I think it's global right now, in fact. We're seeing great traction, and it's early, but great traction in every geo. And so I think the same dynamics are in play certainly in the U.S. and EMEA when it comes to -- as we think about mobile and desktop as a broader business. And we'll work through that over the next couple of quarters.","Bhavan Suri - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then one quick one. Just as we get to the -- closer to the end of life of Windows XP, obviously, we've talked about this in the past, it wasn't a huge driver for XenDesktop. But are you seeing any conversations of CIOs not just about sort of that transition but that sort of accelerating XenDesktop growth as we get to the end of life in -- next year for XP?","David James Henshall","I think, it's one of many conversations that we're having with CIOs right now. I'd say it's not the top of the list. The top of the list continues to be around topics like mobility, like data security. The end of life of XP is not new, and that's probably the biggest point. As we get closer, I'm sure it's an opportunity to have more conversations as the customers start thinking about that. As you'd imagine, we're talking to -- we're at a much more strategic level and much more urgent priorities, I'd say, in most accounts.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wondering, 2 product questions for you. On XenDesktop 7, which you're launching -- you launched here. I'm wondering how you're thinking about that impact the conversations that you're having in the second half particularly around some of the cost benefits that, that platform brings. And then on the NetScaler side, just wondering if you could quantify any of the impact that you're starting to get at this point from Cisco. I know it is early and you mentioned Cisco Live was after the quarter ended, but just trying to get a sense if you're starting to see some sort of halo benefit from the endorsement of Cisco for that product.","David James Henshall","Sure. Walter, I'd say, on the first part, XenDesktop 7 is a really important release and it's important for a couple of reasons. Probably the biggest of which is that it's bringing down complexity materially, and we've talked a lot about that over the last few quarters of one of the barriers to adoption or expansion in many accounts is the fact that desktop virtualization is fairly complex. And so this release was really focused on making it more accessible, so that customers can get through POCs faster, ramped and managed at scale. And so I think we've made big steps forward on that front. Secondarily, it is the first platform that's going to support Windows 2012. We've made a whole bunch of enhancements that Mark and I both talked about around performance and driving down costs. And so it's got -- it's, by far, the most powerful release we've ever had for XenDesktop. And, of course, unifying the architectures between app and desktop into, really, a single solution. So -- but I think it helps. There's no such thing as a hockey stick in these types of businesses. But for new conversations, it will certainly allow them to move faster and will help customers migrate on a pace that is right for whatever their business initiatives are. As far as Cisco is concerned, great early-stage partnership. In terms of the announcements that we made around cloud networking in June, NetScaler 1000V, that will start to have an impact in Q4, so there's really no impact at this time. I'd say that the overall relationship is extremely positive really across networking, what we're doing in mobile workstyles, which include XenDesktop and UCS, as well as some of the cloud services work. A minor amount of business that I would attribute to ACE, and we've had that question a few times in the past, but we're doing a lot more, I'd say, with Cisco influence in the field or accounts that we're managing together and we're able to solve larger problems by integrating various parts of the stack. So it's great, it's early stage and we're optimistic about it going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","David, can you talk a little bit about dynamics between the split of revenue that goes into license bucket and license updates when you sign a desktop deal? Has there been any change in the last few quarters as those growth rates are diverging? And as part of that, do you think we should focus more on your license plus maintenance growth rate as a better metric to analyze that segment instead of just focusing on the license?","David James Henshall","Yes, it's a good question. I mean it's how we think about the business internally and how we measure our sales teams. It's a tough one for us to call out because every quarter is unique and different. And so therefore, we try to keep you focused on the aggregate license and then the aggregate deferred growth. I will say in Q2, for example, I mean the second largest desktop virtualization transaction in the quarter actually had no recognized revenue. We're -- based on a customer request to deliver some things on the back end, that transaction will be recognized over a 3-year period of time. So that's one where a large part of the growth in deferred, in this case, more than half in Q2, is going to be attributed to desktop virtualization. So we'll talk about it at a high level, but probably the best way to think about the business in general is that the aggregate product license line, the aggregate revenue line and then EPS because there really are a lot of moving parts. And strategically, we're having a conversation with a customer that brings together multiple products across the domain.","Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Got it. And one quick one. Your third quarter guidance indicates a very modest sequential uptick, but you just launched Project Avalon and mobility solutions. So qualitatively, if you can talk about what are you baking in from these new products in the third quarter or is it primarily a fourth quarter phenomenon? That's it for me.","David James Henshall","The way we think about guidance is we had a great Q2. We're feeling very good about the business in what is still a fairly uneven environment. We're raising the full year expectations for the business, and we're going into the second half with what I hope to be conservative assumptions downstream but what I think is prudent right now. There's still a number of unknowns in the market. I'd say EMEA is probably the most uncertain of the geos and no expectation for that to get better anytime soon. Public sector in the U.S. continues to be more volatile than it would be historically. And therefore, I want to maintain this posture in the back half of the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. I was just going to ask a question on the mobility offering. Is -- what is a more likely scenario going forward that a customer makes the initial kind of core XenMobile purchase and then later, maybe quarters later, adds in the desktop, XenDesktop, XenApp kind of -- to fill out? Or do you expect them to make a complete purchase and pull the desktop products kind of on the initial deal?","David James Henshall","Steve, I think there's great potential for the future sale of desktop virtualization to XenMobile customers. If for no other reason, than the -- all the things we've done, XenDesktop 7 and the roadmap there, that makes it lower cost, faster and easier to implement at the margin. So migrating a set of apps from physical to virtual, migrating a set of desktops from physical to virtual. We make that easier and easier and easier, lower, lower cost to implement and to own. And so as mobility and the mobility solution that -- within XenMobile itself or our mobile -- native mobile apps, et cetera, device management take root, customers will find it very easy to add on the XenDesktop or XenApp capability to then bring Windows into the same total mobile context as everything else. So we're optimistic about that.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Perfect. And then just on the NetScaler business, obviously, you guys just continue to kill it. I was wondering if you felt that it was a normal quarter just in terms of not pulling business forward and the third quarter seasonally strong from NetScaler. Are you expecting to just have a normal seasonal third quarter for the NetScaler business?","David James Henshall","Yes, Steve, I think the NetScaler seasonality has been evolving over time, and the primary reason is there are a number of large vendors out there that are doing big scale datacenter buildouts, either support new cloud services or infrastructure-as-a-service type of thing. And because of that, we're -- we don't see the Q3 bump as much as we would have 3 or 4 years ago. So I mean, we just posted our third quarter in a row north of 50% year-on-year growth. So I certainly don't expect those types of growth rates to continue. The numbers are just too big at this point. But the diversification of business, I think, is the real story here. And that is we're getting good pull-through as I mentioned from cloud service buildouts. We're continuing to participate strongly in what I call e-commerce or Internet-centric accounts. And then on the enterprise side of the house, all the initiatives that we've talked about over the last several quarters, including the expansion of coverage which every one of our geos posted really good growth in networking, I think there's still some opportunities there. The expansion of products, as -- we mentioned how many people are adopting both the virtual appliances as well as the SDX platform, and I'd say SDX continues to be probably the biggest story where it just really differentiated in the market. And what you can do from a consolidation standpoint, from a multi-tenancy standpoint and do it in software is really unique. And because of that, we had nearly 150 customers per SDX in the quarter, and 85% of those were enterprise customers. So I mean, this is getting great adoption across the board and I think it's a combination of all of those that makes us feel very good about continuing to take share across the category. But in terms of the overall growth rates, those -- we still measure those year-on-year. And our guidance would point to a deceleration in the second half back to closer to normal levels because of just how strong it's been [indiscernible] .","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the leverage you all think you can get out of your desktop installed base as you go into accounts with your MDM solutions. And I'm also wondering how you see that product set evolving over time. We've talked to a lot of people about the market in some cases moving to mobile application management. I'm just wondering how do you think you're positioned as the market continues to evolve there given your strength in the streaming of applications to people's desktops already?","David James Henshall","Heather, I'd say that the opportunity is huge there. And, in fact, over 2\/3 of the business for XenMobile in Q2 was for the Enterprise Edition, which actually is -- has all the MDM, all the mobile apps, all the mobile app management embedded in and included with it and also integrates smoothly with XenApp and XenDesktop. And if you look at the customers that are in that mix, many of them are the strategic customers for XenApp and XenDesktop, where we've got -- already got an entr\u00e9e with the account and opened up a broader conversation with their mobility or their mobile team. So we're already starting to see that in the business and I think as we execute across a pretty aggressive roadmap that you'll see in the second half of the year, it'll actually encourage the installed base to actually check off the box, come to Citrix because it's really a -- it'll be a very easy extension from a XenDesktop or a XenApp installation to add XenMobile installed on top of it.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And one follow-up question. In terms of -- you mentioned the sales force being somewhat preoccupied with -- on the XenMobile side, maybe taking away from some time they might spend on traditional XenDesktop sales. Is this an area where you think eventually you'll need a specialized sales force? Or do you see them kind of coming up to speed on the product and selling them all together?","David James Henshall","Well, I think the answer is both. In fact, we already have both. We have a specialized team and we obviously have our general enterprise sales force. And part of the -- working through this process is that the bandwidth in the specialist team is limited and outstripping the demand, the supply is not up to the demand. So a lot of the enterprise reps are having to learn the product and do a lot more than they probably need to do in the future when it comes to a very XenMobile-centric and mobile device-centric kind of conversation. So I think that's part of what we're working through this year, and we're looking to see better results in terms of the productivity in Q4. And then as we do a number of things at the start of next year around go-to-market, around the roadmap, around partnerships, et cetera, that productivity should increase significantly next year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Israel Hernandez from MKM Partners.","Israel Hernandez - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to drill down a little bit on Europe in the desktop business and the weakness that you've been seeing, it's been ongoing. How is the pipeline looking? Are deals still there or are they evaporating? Is it the transaction business that's suffering? Any particular vertical? Just want to get some more color there as to what you guys are seeing. You're indicating you're not expecting any improvements, certainly over the near term, but just kind of curious about the longer-term outlooks there.","David James Henshall","Sure, Israel. It's David. I'd say that consistent with what I said earlier, it's a mixed bag in EMEA. We had, we think -- you mentioned large transactions. There were, let's see -- I forgot the exact amount. I think there were 10 in the EMEA region, that compares to about 10 last year. So not a lot of change from an enlarged deal point of view. The aggregate value of those was down a bit year-on-year, and I think that's just reflective of the macro environment. As we step back and we look at the individual markets, you're going to have some that are performing well one quarter and some that aren't. And it's been a long time since the majority of them were executing well based on the environment. So last period, Central was challenging as was the North region and we had relative strength in what we call Western Europe. So it'll be a mixed bag, but we're doing the things that we can control and helping customers through the environments where it makes sense. I'd say, as it relates to the overall pipeline though, things aren't going away. I mean the conversations are still there. The ability for customers to pull the trigger with capital is what's been harder to predict, but we're still having active conversations at the same level we have been in the past. So the one unique thing similar to what is happening in the U.S., of course, is around mobile. And it's the same dynamics of customers looking at this and saying, \"I can do it quickly. It's a simpler, smaller opportunity,\" and so we can get those done. And similar to Mark's comments, those will pull through the broader strategic conversation, make it easier downstream. So we're executing, we've got good leadership there and we'll keep focusing on the things that we can control.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Last quarter, you did say that -- I know you're not breaking out [indiscernible] , but if possible, you would say that desktop and mobile combined would grow license at low single digits. And now you've got -- you did 2% instead of the double digit this quarter. Does it look like that will be probably more like negative or flat, or what will that be? What's the update to that? And then secondly, what do you need to do in terms of OpEx? What's the plan in terms of spend to start to get both sales force and channel more effectively selling mobile and combined mobile\/desktop?","David James Henshall","Yes, Michael, on the overall business, you're right. We're not going to give micro guidance at this point in time. There's too much -- there's too many moving parts going on in the organization. And since we have a general team -- a generalist team to a large degree, they can focus on different parts of the business, and we'll keep guidance at the overall product license line. I will say, though, regarding mobile and desktop, I believe that the growth will accelerate as we look into Q3 and Q4. And that's a function largely of productivity starting to flatten out and mobile starting to ramp. As far as the individual products within that, that will be determined based on the types of projects that customers are engaging with in that period. As far as OpEx, we're doing a lot of training right now. We've spent the first part of this year getting the new teams up to speed and getting integrations underway, getting systems put together. Lot of activity trading in both channel partners, as well as core team on mobile and how mobile and desktop fit together into a larger solution. How to position those both as independent problem-solving tools, as well as a strategic solution. So not a huge amount of incremental investment on the go-to-market side. Consistent with the last couple of quarters, the majority of investments we're making on go-to-market are around networking, and that's been an area that is fairly unique and fairly complex, and therefore, requires more direct investment. And you see the results there, I mean we're having terrific growth across every geo because we can just get in that many more conversations. And so we're doing very well there. And that's going to continue. There's definitely some places where we are opportunity, excuse me, capacity constraint in networking around the globe.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So is the total license guide that was low double digits since the last quarter, that's still in place?","David James Henshall","In terms of total license for the year, it's basically unchanged. It's low teens with what would be implied in our guidance. And then the total revenue number would be roughly 15%. And that's how we're thinking about the business right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked. But just wanted to focus back in on XenMobile and just sort of a broad industry question. Mark, just curious what you're seeing from a pricing perspective out there? Obviously, you're sort of uniquely across both mobile application management and mobile device management. Just what are you seeing out there and any sort of specifics between MDM versus MAM?","Mark B. Templeton","Phil, I think what we see is that basic MDM is a very low price, low value kind of technology and solution for most customers. And the more they understand about kind of how to manage the mobile environment and enable mobile workstyle, the less incremental value they have for MDM. And I think we see that in MDM, sort of, specific deals and why we've packaged XenMobile in a way that allows us to sit on top of someone else's MDM if a customer wants to almost get it for free from somewhere else, because the real value in terms of the security of data, the delivery and provisioning dynamically of apps and the availability of sort of core mobile apps as a suite, including mail and browsing and data -- mobile data, et cetera, is really where the value is and the value proposition is. And so I think as the market gets more educated on mobile -- enterprise mobility, in general, it really has everyone concluding the MDM is not where the value is. It's really in the whole stack that XenMobile enterprise represents. And so the pricing there we've been delighted with. And when it comes to sort of a shootout on MDM, we try not to do bad business there and we can sell customers value add on top of other MDM in those cases.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's like a lot of the call was focused on the very mournful, sorrowful piece. But I want to just stand here and congratulate you guys on putting up a 21% license growth rate number, which compared to some of the other companies that reported, stands out, so a very nice job on that and also on the margin front and EPS front and the balance sheet and cash flow. So just to keep it a little bit more balanced. I wanted to understand more about what's going on, on the NetScaler side. Do you think these gains are sustainable? Is it market share that's really driving the gains in that business? And also secondly, I wanted to hear, Mark, you on what do you think is the total available market for XenMobile? It would intuitively seem to me that anybody that is a XenDesktop user -- more XenDesktop users or XenApp users, probably going to be likely candidates for something like this. I just want to understand how you look at the TAM and how you view your ability to be more differentiated and so-called locked in to the customer over a long period of time, so we can view this business much like a XenDesktop, XenApp business with a long tail and trajectory.","David James Henshall","Kash, this is David. Let me take the NetScaler question. Actually, let me first say, thank you, I appreciate the comments on the overall business. Yes, you're right, we're really happy with the total quarter, being up 21% in product and the mix environment is great. So the strategies are all coming together and the product sets feel good for the second half of the year. Regarding NetScaler, maybe I'll just reiterate a couple of things that I said earlier around the -- where the business is coming from. And it's balanced, and that's a good thing. We're getting good participation, growing business out of the international markets. I think we've had a couple of quarters in a row with EMEA up 40%, 50%, which is great. And a lot of that is just due to expanded capacity. And we're getting strong growth in Japan and Pacific as well. So we're going to continue to invest in that area so that we've got coverage enabled to actually have these conversations. But on the product front, I think we're taking share from a market standpoint simply because of the breadth and performance of our product. The software-based approach to networking, I think, is proven to be something that customers are really gravitated towards -- gravitating towards and that's because it works. It works for them. It allows them flexibility to scale up and scale down as they need to, and making it easier for customers to do what's right for their business is a good long-term proposition. So I think from a market share standpoint, when the numbers come out, I'm assuming we will take pretty good share in some places. But right now, we're really just focused on those different segments and trying to be successful there. The one place I didn't mention yet is around telco, and that's a new market for us. And we're still lightly penetrated there. And most of the time, we're entering telco space through Bytemobile where we're getting attached with pretty much every new transaction for Bytemobile. We'll include a pull-through of some NetScalers as well. So just another thing to keep an eye on as we go into 2014.","Mark B. Templeton","And, Kash, regarding your question about TAM, around desktop and mobile. First of all, TAMs and -- when you look at TAMs, it's a little bit of black magic and it's based upon how you slice and dice the market place. And what we do, like most companies, we take all the external data from industry analysts, et cetera, plug -- and add [ph] that to our own view. Now in the case of desktop and mobile, we're a huge player in the market. So a lot of kind of the number you get to is the combination of the external view that when analysts look at us and then when we look at what might be possible through execution and value proposition. So we put them together, which is how we believe customers over the long term, let's say, the next 2, 3 years are looking at this marketplace. We look at about $6 billion TAM in 2015. And that takes into consideration the various segments of enterprise mobile, which does include MDM, it does include MAM. It does include some segments of core mobile apps. It does include certain segments of mobile analytics. It does include certain dimensions of mobile security. And then on the desktop side, obviously, we look much more purely at desktop virtualization and exclude things like classic desktop management and really focusing on virtual desktops and apps. And obviously, a big influence there over the next few years is based upon our view on our product execution in the product roadmap. But also how this kind of technology will get deployed in the cloud context, not only by customers, but also by service providers. And we haven't talked much about service providers today, but that part of our business in -- on the desktop side continues to be pretty exciting. We think that they're great potential routes to market for XenMobile. And as the roadmap evolves here, it'll be easier and easier for service providers to actually be out there in the marketplace with the complete solution. So probably a little bit longer answer than you expected. So think $6 billion, 2015, a combination of both the desktop and mobile markets and a lot of segments within, especially the mobile space.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays Capital.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Kash made a great comment there, and I would kind of echo that congratulation there. And just a question on the Software-as-a-Service part of the business. If I look at the last 2 quarters, the growth rate has -- it looks like it has changed somewhat. This used to be like 18%, 20% grower. We're now kind of more in the 13%, 14%, 15% range. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers that we should be thinking about if we model the business going forward? Because obviously, the law of large numbers that what are the other drivers to kind of come up with the growth rates in the future?","David James Henshall","Sure, Raimo. This is David. There's really 4 segments within the SaaS business that I think are important to point out. The first is remote access. That's our GoToMyPC product; remote support, which is largely GoToAssist; collaboration, which we talked about as the GoToMeeting family; and data sharing, which is ShareFile. And each one of those 4 are addressing different segments and they're growing at different rates. I'd say the remote access market is one that is very mature at this point in time, and so therefore, it's been slowly shrinking. That business has been declining and pulling down the overall growth rates. The 2, call them most strategic that we've focused on certainly around collaboration, which is still growing north of 20%. We're doing really well with the GoToMeeting family there. And then ShareFile, which -- our data business is new, so it's still a relatively small percent of the overall total. But I mentioned it was growing 75% or so. The way to think about those is not only standalone products, but also part of a larger solution or a platform, if you will, for how we're thinking about mobility and ShareFile, for example, integrated with the XenMobile products. We've done integrations with receiver, therefore, desktop and app virtualization. And so it's truly a platform. Reported revenue, I think this range where we are right now is a pretty good modeling range for the balance of the year. And then as the faster growing businesses become a larger component of the total, we'll talk about that as we get into 2014.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire at CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could address your plans around Apache CloudStack. It's nice to see that is in production around in 200 clouds right now. But what are your plans in terms of investing around that and expectations for potentially a pull-through or expansion of your products into some of those production sites and customers?","David James Henshall","Yes, Ed, so the number I cited, almost 200 production clouds, those are actually CloudPlatform implementations, which is our product that has Apache CloudStack embedded in it. There are many more than 200 production clouds on Apache CloudStack in that it's a production-ready environment far beyond anything else that's available in the market, that's open source. And then secondly, we're not -- we're a participant in that community. We're going to -- we're continuing to invest as we have all along, and we've seen a lot more momentum come to the CloudStack community over the last year in terms of the number of companies that are contributing and the number of net total contributors which is making CloudStack more and more and more robust, which then obviously helps us on the CloudPlatform side. Part of what we do in the commercial availability of CloudPlatform is we add tight integrations with XenServer, tight integrations with NetScaler and then we add on top of all of that, a product line we call CloudPortal that actually makes it easy for service providers to publish and sell the finished goods that live underneath on top of CloudPlatform. So we're continuing to invest and we're seeing that more and more of this is there are segments that are richer than others right now, and we're -- we've learned a lot about where that opportunity is. And the segments are where there's a high urgency for production, for a platform that's reliable, secure, that will scale. And there's less urgency where people are still crafting strategies and talking about it. So we've seen great uptake in telco, what we like to think of as the enlightened enterprise and which is a smaller slice of the overall enterprise market and education as well. All have been good segments for CloudPlatform. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color around that segment of the business.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","David, I just want to, I guess, circle back around on some of your comments around the distraction around mobile versus, say, some of the older products. I get there's always sort of a shiny new toy syndrome that can come in when there's a really exciting product. But your salespeople are also pretty -- they're pretty -- they only do that if there's a real opportunity for them to exceed quota with those products and do even better than they were thinking. So should we think about this as salespeople are taking a step back or integrating XenMobile into their -- I guess, some of their pipeline, but the pipeline is just going to be -- gets pushed back? And along with that, if you sort of reset, meaning you have a deal but you want to start bringing XenMobile into the deal because you see an opportunity, I guess how long does that take, how long does that set you back? Meaning when you see salespeople potentially expanding their pipeline but pushing out the conversion on that, is it a 3-month sort of pushout? Is it a 6-month? I guess, what are you seeing? Any, I guess, color around that would be really helpful.","David James Henshall","Sure, Kirk. The best way to think about it is the fact that most of our ERMs or sales teams are on annual quotas. So they think about the business in the context of a calendar, fiscal for us, year. And therefore, the quarter-to-quarter boundaries are not as important as you'd think. And so it's really about building up the business within that context of that timeframe. And so there's -- it's not surprising that there is a productivity hit when we bring in a new market that every customer wants to talk about. Some of it is our teams actively driving that, of course, as they're really out there building pipeline and doing things like that. And the other, frankly, is from customers. As customers understand the breadth of the portfolio and whether they were at Synergy or just heard press -- announcements, and they want to understand what our capabilities are. So they may be trying to upsize a deal or reprioritize individual projects. So it'll come from both angles. And it's one of those things where -- pipeline is about planting seeds and you harvest those as you get later in the year, and confident that our teams are very focused on that. And so they're not going to let it get away from very long. We have really solid sales orgs around the world.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just one follow-up, if I could. We've heard sort of mixed data points out of the Asia-Pac region this quarter. You guys obviously price in dollars, so for your Japanese customers, your products are unfortunately getting more expensive. Can you just talk about what you guys are seeing -- it's actually a lot of different territories in Asia- Pac, but what you're seeing if there has been any sort of impact from the macro gain slowing down a little bit in China?","David James Henshall","Yes, I think, similar to Europe, it's hard to call specifics in markets. There's a whole bunch of individual market dynamics at play. We do price in dollars in a lot of areas, and so there's some pressure from an exchange rate point of view. And the flip side of that is we also price in local currency in a lot of our SaaS businesses, so we've got some headwinds there as well. So mixed bag for us. I'd say, from an attainment point of view, both our attainment against plans, both of our Pacific and Japan teams are doing really well. There's a lot of opportunity and actually I think a record number of large strategic transactions coming out of the broader regions, certainly a record for Q2. So we're having the right level of conversation and we'll power through. Nothing that I would call out as a -- beyond ordinary there. Certainly not as volatile as, I would say, the European continent is.","Eduardo Fleites","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives from FBR Capital Markets.","Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Guys, after some of those questions [indiscernible] I checked the press release to make sure it was being raised when you look at it. My question is more around -- with NetScaler. Are you starting to see some competitive displacements out there in terms of just given the strength that you're seeing across the board?","David James Henshall","Yes, I'd say, we're -- we focus less on competitive displacements and more of just, on a customer-by-customer basis, what problems we're trying to solve. If that means we're displacing a specific vendor, great. But really looking at everything from TDC, refresh cycles to incremental opportunities with virtual appliances to datacenter consolidation with SDX. So it's across the board, and I said earlier that from a product portfolio standpoint, we feel very good about the breadth of what we're delivering right now. We think we've got a really good combination of tools and it's unique in the market right now. So it's execution for us to continue to add capacity where we can. And the volatile part of this business, of course, will be around big datacenter build outs, cloud services. Those come and go from period to period, it's not steady state. So it's one of the reasons why year-on-year growth rates will bounce around a little bit. But in the aggregate, I feel very good about our ability to take a lot of share this year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers.
