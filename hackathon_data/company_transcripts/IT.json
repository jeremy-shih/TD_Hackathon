Please proceed sir.","Brian Shipman","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Gartner\u2019s second quarter 2012 earnings call. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond.","This call will begin with a discussion of Q2 2012 financial results disclosed in today\u2019s press release, followed by an opportunity for you to ask questions. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the press release is available on our website, that URL is www.gartner.com.","Before we begin, we need to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward-looking statements.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Gartner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Gene?","Eugene Hall","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings call. For the second quarter of 2012 Gartner once again delivered strong results. On an FX neutral basis, we showed growth across all three of our business segments.","Research, our largest and most profitable segment continued to grow at double-digit rates. Consulting had another solid quarter performance and events continued to exceed our long-term growth targets. Normalized EBITDA was up 16% quarter-over-quarter, and diluted earnings per share was up 34% over second quarter of 2011.","As you\u2019re aware, we\u2019re looking at a tough world economy with economic uncertainty coming from all major geographies. Here in the U.S. unemployment continues to be a challenge. In Europe, the debt crisis remains threatening and in Asia, growth has slowed. Despite this environment, Gartner consistently delivered excellent results across all our businesses.","We\u2019ve achieved double-digit results across all geographies and industries for the past several quarters, and we expect this trend to continue. Our results demonstrate the strength and successful execution of our strategy for growth. Our strategy enables us to continue to capture our substantial market opportunity, which as I\u2019ve stated in the past, we estimate to be at $47 billion. The fundamentals of our strategy are to create extraordinary research insights, to build strong sales capability, to deliver high-value differentiated offerings, to provide world-class service, and to continually improve our operational effectiveness.","IT is complex, continually evolving and remains one of the most important drivers of growth and competitive advantage for virtually every institution in the world. Whether an organization is looking to leverage technology to achieve rapid growth, or looking to manage costs, Gartner is the best resource to turn to for help and our results show it. The Gartner brand is in a class by itself. Our products, services and people are superior to the competition. And we have a successful and attractive business model with high renewal rates, great cash flow and incremental margins. I remain confident and excited about our prospects for sustained double-digit growth over the long term.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call to Chris, who can comment in detail on our second quarter results.","Chris Lafond","Thanks, Gene and good morning, everyone. We delivered another very strong quarter in Q2. On an FX neutral basis, we once again achieved double-digit growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow. In research, year-over-year contract value growth remained strong at 14% on an FX neutral basis, and retention rates ended at or near all-time highs.","In Events, our revenues were up 16% FX neutral and accelerated in Q2 from Q1 on a same events basis. And in Consulting, our benchmark and core Consulting businesses grew a combined 9% year-over-year FX neutral while our Contract Optimization business was lower year-over-year as a few deals moved into Q3.","Demand for our services was robust across all three business segments in the second quarter. Our strong top line performance and effective execution in capitalizing on the operating leverage in our business allowed us to once again expand our gross contribution margin, which is now at 60%, up from 59% in Q2 of 2011.","As a result, we delivered significant growth in earnings in Q2. In the second quarter, normalized EBITDA increased 16% year-over-year and our GAAP diluted earnings per share were up 34%. With this strong start, we\u2019re well positioned for continued growth for the remainder of 2012. These results again demonstrate the continued successful execution of our strategy, our ability to consistently deliver on the long-term financial objectives we have established over the past few years and the overall value we bring to the strategic IT initiatives of our clients.","I\u2019ll now review the results of our three business segments in more detail before taking your questions. And I\u2019ll begin with Research. Second quarter, Research revenue was up 11% to $278 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Research revenue growth was 14% in the quarter. The margin in this segment increased from 67% to 68% as our strong execution continues to capitalize on the operating leverage inherent in this business. All of our key Research business metrics improved or remained very strong in the second quarter. Contract value grew to a record level of $1.141 billion, a growth of 14% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis.","Our growth in contract value in Q2 remained broad-based, with all geographies and industry segments delivering strong double-digit growth year-over-year. New business again increased from last year continuing the trend we\u2019ve seen since late 2009. The new business mix was balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. While our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting, approximately 83% of contract value growth came from volume.","This volume growth reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients. As a result, we ended the quarter with 12,474 client organizations, up 7% year-over-year. And as for pricing, we\u2019ve consistently increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year on an annual basis since 2005 and that remains our plan again in 2012. We have maintained client retention near record highs for the past two years and our client retention rate ended the quarter at 83%. In addition to retaining our Research clients at an impressive rate, the clients we retain continue to increase our spending with Gartner.","And as a result, wallet retention also remained strong at 99%. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a four quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","So in summary, our Research segment continued its strong performance in the second quarter. We grew contract value by $141 million on an FX neutral basis year-over-year. We continue to see strong demand from clients. And we expect continued acceleration in revenue and contract value growth over time. We remain confident in our ability to deliver 15% to 20% annual revenue growth in this business over the long term.","Turning now to Events, our Events business continues to deliver exceptionally strong year-over-year growth. Events revenue in the second quarter increased 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and 16% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. During the second quarter, we held 21 events with 12,540 attendees, compared to 21 events with 11,295 attendees in the second quarter of 2011.","On a same events basis, Events revenue accelerated in the second quarter from the first quarter of this year, with total attendees up 12% year-over-year and exhibitors up 13%, both in line with the guidance we provided to you for the full year 2012. We\u2019re seeing strength in every geography and across the entire Events portfolio. Our Events business is well positioned to deliver continued growth through 2012 and beyond.","Moving on to Consulting, revenues in our Consulting business grew 1% in the second quarter on an FX neutral basis, but declined 1% on a reported basis. Our benchmark and core Consulting businesses delivered strong results up a combined 9% FX neutral year-over-year in Q2. Our Q2 Consulting segment results were impacted by our contract optimization business, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter given the nature of that business. As I mentioned earlier, a few large deals moved from Q2 into Q3.","Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for Consulting ended the quarter at $93.1 million or a healthy four months of backlog. Our pipeline remains solid as we enter the third quarter. Billable head count of 481 was down 2% from the second quarter of 2011 and up slightly from last quarter. Utilization for Q2 was over 67%, up 360 basis points from the second quarter a year ago and revenue per billable head count remained above $400,000 per year ending the quarter at $425,000. With a solid second quarter, a four month existing backlog and a strong future pipeline, the Consulting business is on track to deliver results in line with our guidance for the full year.","Moving down the rest of the income statement, during the second quarter, our gross contribution margin increased by 114 basis points year-over-year to 60%. This increase was driven by margin improvement in our Research and Events segments. In particular, the successful execution of our strategy continues to capitalize on the high incremental margins and operating leverage inherent in our research business.","SG&A increased by $12 million year-over-year during the second quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to the continued growth in our sales force. As of June 30, we had 1,356 quota-bearing sales associates as compared to 1,146 a year ago, which represents an 18% growth year-over-year, in line with our long-term target for growing our sales force by 15% to 20% per year.","Moving on to earnings, we delivered another strong quarter of solid earnings growth. Normalized EBITDA was $79 million in the second quarter up 16% year-over-year. And GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.43 up 34% year-over-year. Note that GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 were negatively impacted by $0.02 of acquisition related charges. Our normalized EBITDA margin was 19.9%, all of this is consistent with the phasing guidance we laid out at our Investor Day in February.","Turning now to cash, our strong performance so far this year translated into a significant year-over-year increase in cash from operations, which was $99 million for the first half of 2012 as compared to $64 million in the first half of 2011.","Over the long term, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow substantially greater than our net income given our tight cash management and the negative working capital characteristics of our Research business. During the second quarter, we utilized our cash to complete the acquisition of Ideas International for a net purchase price of $10 million, as well as continuing to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program.","Our share repurchases for the first half of 2012 were over 2 million shares at a total cost of almost $85 million, which nearly matched this level of share repurchases in the first half of 2011. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position with net debt of $50 million. Our current credit facility runs through December 2015, and at this time provides us with almost $362 million of available borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value. We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash and in the absence of appropriate acquisition opportunities, we believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital and we have $231 million remaining under our Board authorization.","Now I will close with a business outlook for 2012. Our business remains well positioned for another year of strong growth in revenue and earnings. At the midpoint of the year, we\u2019re on track to deliver the results we communicated back in February. The second quarter modestly exceeded our original expectations for EBITDA and EPS. As a result, we remain confident in the guidance we provided at the start of the year.","Looking ahead to the second half of 2012, I would point out that our full-year GAAP EPS guidance remained unchanged despite our expectations that acquisition and integration charges related to the recently acquired Ideas International will impact EPS by roughly $0.03 per share on an after-tax basis.","So to summarize, we delivered great results for the second quarter of 2012 and demand for our services is strong. We generated double-digit revenue growth and our key business metrics remained strong in the second quarter of 2012. Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with positive operating leverage inherent in our businesses delivered strong operating margins and we continue to generate substantial operating cash flow. We will continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we expect to repurchase shares throughout 2012.","Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in the second quarter, we established a solid foundation for delivering a strong year of revenue and earnings growth this year. We remain well positioned to continue our consistent delivery of double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing returns to our shareholders over the long term.","We\u2019ll now be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks and good morning. So, Gene, I know you typically don\u2019t give guidance on contract value, but given the stepped up pace of sales force hiring, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re feeling more confident about the second half of the year or maybe even more broadly, if you could just talk about what you see in terms of visibility in the backlog or contract value pipeline?","Eugene Hall","Good morning, Peter. So, I\u2019m actually feeling great about the second half for the year and on into 2013. We did add a lot of sales people towards to the end of 2011 and those sales people have gone through their training and they\u2019re getting their initial territories, and so I really expect they\u2019d be hitting traction in both the second half and then obviously through 2013. If I look at our pipeline, pipeline looks terrific in terms of deals and as Chris said, while we had great growth in all geographies and all industries. Our pipeline continues to look that way across the board. So, I\u2019m quite optimistic about both the second half as well as again going into the 2013.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks, Gene. And Chris the \u2013 so the margin performance is pretty impressive here in the second quarter particularly after the margin was basically flattish in the first quarter, can you talk about the implications of stepped up sales force expansion in terms of \u2013 should we be thinking about more modest margin improvement in the second half?","Chris Lafond","Thanks Peter. The way to think about the margin expansion for us comes in a couple places. As you know, we talk often about the incremental margins in each of the three businesses. So, on the research side, we believe we have a roughly 70% incremental margin. So, for every dollar we sell, about $0.70 will flow through the gross margin line. Today that business is at about 68% margin. So, there is still some room for that to continue to expand up towards that 70% number. Consulting we think over the long-term is 40% and we are not quite there yet, and Events is between 48% and 50% and we\u2019re starting to get pretty close to that number. So, there is certainly still some room each of the three segments, as we continue to grow and the mix shift as well. Right so, as we continue to grow Research faster than the others, you continue to see margin expansion simply because of that mix shift.","So, those are all the drivers that happen kind of on the gross profit line, as you go below, and look at the SG&A line, SG&A has been relatively stable as you know, we\u2019re investing heavily in sales as we talk about. We continue to manage G&A, G&A continues to come down as a percent of revenue; that will continue to be a source of margin expansion as well.","So, we still think there\u2019s plenty of opportunity, I think we\u2019ve done a really good job of expanding the sales force over the past six or seven years, while also expanding margin. And I think we can continue to do that 50 to 150 basis point expansion, as we continue to move ahead.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Got it. Thank you and then just last thing, Gene or Chris any comments in terms of sales force productivity, and leverage you\u2019re seeing from that, Gene you sort of mention that I guess, to my earlier question.","Eugene Hall","Yeah, so basically on sales force productivity, there\u2019s two things going on. One is, for our tenured sales people, we continue to work very hard to drive that sales productivity, we see that rising over time. And then obviously, as we add more new sales people that changes the mix, in their first year or so, our new sales people have lower productivity and so, if we have a richer mix of new sales people in the first year obviously that impacts the kind of average productivity.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Got it, okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and your next question comes from the line of William Bird, Lazard. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Bill Bird \u2013 Lazard","Good morning. Nice results guys. Just a follow-on related to contract value, just given in the macro context and some of the seasoning that\u2019s going on in the sales force, when would you expect contract value growth to get back in 15% plus range?","Eugene Hall","Hey. Its Gene. We are not, as Peter mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t forecast contract value, but as I mentioned I think we expect to see \u2013 we\u2019ve got a great pipeline as we see the large numbers of people that we added in the latter part of last year get up to speed we expect an acceleration over time. So I think we\u2019re talking in the second half into 2013.","Bill Bird \u2013 Lazard","And at this stage, just given the macro volatility, have you seen any of that translate to business on the ground?","Eugene Hall","The thing that \u2013 it\u2019s clearly a tough macro environment everywhere, but the thing that IT is really important for every institution as I mentioned in my talk and what we see impacts our performance more than anything else is our execution as opposed to the macroeconomic factors. As I mentioned and Chris also mentioned, we had double digit growth in every geography and in every industry segment, again this quarter even though the economic environment is not that great. And again if we look beneath that through the individual sales teams that do well versus don\u2019t do well, it really is driven by economic \u2013 I mean it\u2019s really driven by our operational performance, not the economic environment. IT is a great way to save costs in the institution and when people have those kinds of issues, we help them with that. And so it\u2019s really applicable \u2013 our services are really applicable in any kind of environment.","Bill Bird \u2013 Lazard","Okay. And just final question on Events, what are you seeing in advanced bookings for exhibitors and attendees?","Chris Lafond","Hey, Bill, it\u2019s Chris. As you know, we monitor that very closely, if you look at our, for example upcoming fall symposiums, the advanced exhibitors are looking great well ahead of last year, so continuing to look really strong. If you look back at all the events we\u2019ve had so far this year, all of them \u2013 almost every event we\u2019ve had is up year-over-year both in attendees and exhibitors so we\u2019ve got really strong performance. Everything we see so far continues to suggest that we\u2019ll continue so we see no indication of anything other than that.","Bill Bird \u2013 Lazard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Thank you, good morning gentlemen. Just to expand on the sales productivity area. Can you maybe give us some color on what the productivity looks by region? Is Europe because of the economic situation there, it may be slightly less than U.S. and Asia or just some characteristics around the different regions?","Eugene Hall","Yeah. So, our \u2013 it\u2019s Gene, our sales productivity varies on a number of factors not just geography, it\u2019s things like are they selling to large companies versus small companies versus mid-sized companies, is it a market where we\u2019ve got a very large counter value base or one that we entered relatively recently. So, for example, some places in China, we might have entered more recently not have as big a contract value base, so not as be of renewals. So, all those things affected, you have to look at all those.","But if I would kind of summarize above that to sort of say, what\u2019s going on by geography, to get back to original question, is there is no major driver that says, gee we\u2019re getting, things are doing worse because the economic problem somewhere is worse and in fact, our \u2013 if you look in Europe just as an example, they \u2013 their performance year-over-year was among the best in our entire \u2013 if you look at across all the regions despite the economic environment. As I mentioned, we had double-digit growth everywhere in Europe, in fact year-over-year was one of the stronger performers. So, it\u2019s really again driven by our operational execution, not by the market \u2013 not so much by the market environment.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","All right. And then you obviously grew sales force, again 18% year-over-year this quarter. I guess, just to try and get an update on sort of the hiring environment, I mean obviously people out there are looking for jobs, but just in terms of the quality and attrition rates, maybe just an update on that?","Eugene Hall","Yes. So, our attrition rates are right where they have been. Our sales force attrition hasn\u2019t changed materially. So, that\u2019s going great. In fact, we\u2019re very focused on actually lowering it because we would like to have people to stay longer, particularly making sure we hire people that are a really good fit with Gartner.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","All right, again the last question, just for the Ideas acquisition, like was there any contribution to revenue, contract value, et cetera this quarter and maybe should we expect anything for the next two?","Chris Lafond","Hi, Manav. It\u2019s Chris. The Ideas acquisition, as you know, is a very, very small organization. So, there\u2019s really no material impact to revenue, EBITDA, CV. The only place that there was anything even remotely material was the $0.02 of acquisition-related charges that we talked about. That number will be $0.03 for the full year. So, we\u2019ve already taken a bulk of that and for the rest of the year it should not be material to our results at all.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","All right, great. Thanks a lot of guys.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Tim McHugh, William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tim \u2013 William Blair","Yes, thanks. Just want to circle back to the contribution margin for Research. I know there is inherent leverage in the business, but it\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s particularly strong this quarter. Was there anything that you\u2019re seeing in terms of the efficiency of the research organization or something else that explains it or is it really just normal operating leverage?","Chris Lafond","No, nothing unusual. No one-time things. I would say it\u2019s just normal ongoing operation of the business. I think as we continue to grow the Research business, we know how to manage those costs. We know how to take advantage of the leverage in that business. So I wouldn\u2019t say there was anything unique or different, there are periods of time where we have timing of different things that bounce between quarters, so you may see a particular quarter a little stronger. But overall I think for the full year, we still expect that we\u2019ll see a nice expansion in that segment.","Tim \u2013 William Blair","Okay. And then just on the uses of cash here, you talked about buying back stock, it was a little lower this quarter than the prior few quarters. Is that because you\u2019re looking for acquisitions and you\u2019re waiting to see how things were happening or is it just the normal timing and I guess what does that mean for the second half in terms of uses?","Chris Lafond","Yeah. I think there\u2019s just normal timing between quarters. I think if you look at the half, we\u2019re basically right where we expect to be in terms of our share repurchase program. And yes we were looking at \u2013 we always look at acquisitions and continue to look at acquisitions. We obviously used some money for one this quarter. But, I would expect that you\u2019ll continue to see us be in the market on a regular basis and it could be lumpy every quarter, but overall we\u2019ll continue to be in the market.","Tim \u2013 William Blair","Okay. And my last one. The number of organizations, the growth really picked up there and was a little better than I would have thought. Was that fairly evenly spread or are there particular regions or markets that drove that?","Chris Lafond","It\u2019s pretty well balanced, when you look at our overall contract value growth and you look at the overall growth in CV by either geography, industry, it is extremely well balanced across all of that, so I wouldn\u2019t point out any individual place that was particularly stronger or weaker than anywhere else. So I would say, continues to be very balanced.","Tim \u2013 William Blair","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Bill Sutherland, Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Bill Sutherland \u2013 Northland Securities","Thanks very much. Just want to be clear, Chris, on the trend, contract optimization revenue. That\u2019s just a push out, correct? You don\u2019t see \u2013 I mean it\u2019s not like a headwind that you\u2019re dealing with?","Chris Lafond","No, not at all, if you look at our Consulting business, as I talked about on the call, our Core Consulting and Benchmark businesses had a really strong year-over-year performance so continuing the strength we saw in Q1. So those were both up a combined 9%, FX neutral. Contract optimization can be a little bit lumpy as the nature of that business depends on when clients choose to do a particular IT purchase transactions and so we\u2019ve completed some work on few deals that we already see coming into Q3 so those have just slipped from Q2 to Q3. So we still feel very confident that the guidance we\u2019ve given in the businesses performing exactly as we\u2019d expected.","Eugene Hall","Bill, it\u2019s Gene. I\u2019ll just give a little color on that which is, the way that business works is we do the work helping the client and we get paid when they actually sign the contract and we had a few deals that we actually, as Chris said, completed work in actually during Q2 but they signed the contract in like the first couple weeks of Q3. So we don\u2019t get paid until then. And our expectation is that those deals will just enhance our Q3 business with that segment.","Bill Sutherland \u2013 Northland Securities","Makes sense. I just thought since it\u2019s tied to client purchases and that might be a place where the economy\u2019s having some impact? So I just want to be clear on that.","Eugene Hall","Yeah, actually, if anything \u2013 Bill, just one thought on that, if anything it\u2019s the opposite which is that, there\u2019s $3.1 trillion or $3.2 trillion of IT purchases, we cover a teeny portion of that. And the \u2013 that business is in very high demand, because people \u2013 in places where people are under cost pressures, that\u2019s a great way to save money. And so if anything I think there is \u2013 when times are tough is when that business shines the best.","Bill Sutherland \u2013 Northland Securities","Makes sense. I wondered if you will \u2013 I was looking to see if you release this in the past or talked about churn, customer churn, in terms of either voluntary, like deciding to end the service, or involuntary related to corporate activity and if that\u2019s shifting at all?","Chris Lafond","Hey, Bill. It\u2019s Chris. So I would say if you look at our client retention rates, our client retention rates are at essentially all-time high, so I think we\u2019re at 83% this quarter which is up from where we were, by another point. As we always talked about our longer-term goal, we believe we\u2019re driving towards a 90% number there. We think there is certainly some activity that\u2019s related to acquisitions, bankruptcies et cetera. So, there is some percentage of accounts that we can\u2019t necessarily control, because of those things. I would not say there is any meaningful shift in anything we\u2019ve seen, I think our retention rates continue to improve and continued to improve with all the activities that we\u2019re taking to work on that.","Bill Sutherland \u2013 Northland Securities","So 90% is kind of like the natural ceiling potentially?","Chris Lafond","I mean where we are today, we certainly have set a target to get 90% and as we get there, as we always do with you guys, we\u2019ll share with you what we think we can do as we get to those numbers. So, we\u2019re always going to be strive to be better than where we are today.","Eugene Hall","Yeah, just to add \u2013 it\u2019s Gene, just to add to it \u2013 we\u2019re actually quite optimistic that we can continue to increase that retention, as Chris said, over time.","Bill Sutherland \u2013 Northland Securities","Great. And then last one from me, on research contract terms, what proportion are annual and what proportion are multi-year?","Chris Lafond","As you know, the minimum contract length for the most part is one year, we have about a third of our contracts are multi-year at any point in time. And when you look at contract value, the only thing in contract value, it\u2019s all annualized. So even if we have multi-year contracts, you\u2019re only seeing one year\u2019s worth of CV in that number. So the multi-year does not affect our CV number.","Bill Sutherland \u2013 Northland Securities","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Anjun Singh, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, this is Kelly Flynn on Anjun\u2019s line, thanks. Just a couple of questions, sorry to go back to this, I think this is the third time on the back half contract value thoughts, but I think in response to Bill\u2019s question, Gene, you said you\u2019re very confident and you mentioned something about the second half and into 2013 with respect to acceleration. Couldn\u2019t quite hear exactly what you said there, I\u2019m not sure what you mean, we\u2019re obviously trying to figure out if you expect contract value growth to accelerate in the second half or is this a 2013 issue? So, if you just go back to that comment and clarify that would be helpful? Thanks.","Eugene Hall","Sure, Kelly. So, we don\u2019t forecast contract value growth, so we\u2019re not going to give a forecast for what the number is going to be, but what I\u2019m saying basically is that we have capacity in place. We\u2019re executing well and we think we can continue to execute well. And as a result, I\u2019m quite optimistic that over time our contract value growth will accelerate.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. All right, fair enough. And then for the sales force growth I know you said 15% to 20% for the year, which is consistent with past comments. Should we expect that to come in towards the lower end of the 155 to 20% in the back half given what you\u2019ve done in the first half?","Eugene Hall","Yeah. Again, I think we\u2019re \u2013 we gave the 15% to 20% based on our operational performance, and so and we look for areas where we see the best opportunities to add sales people and there\u2019s a rate at which people can productively come onboard and we gauge based on looking at actually our operational ability to assimilate new people and we think the floor of that 15%, we can easily do 15% and we think kind of right now, the maximum to do is 20% and so it\u2019s not like we have a fixed number or aiming towards more of that, we do it on an operational, what makes sense operationally.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay great and then just a third one back to sales force productivity, I think I backed into kind of how you guys calculated with some help from Brian about the NCVI per salesperson, net contract value increase per sales person. I\u2019m just wondering if that looked like the decline widened a little bit in the quarter year-over-year. Can you help us understand sort of how do you \u2013 how should we think about that metric, the net contract value increase per salesperson, should that increase sequentially in the third quarter or should the decline narrow? I mean can you give us any help on how we can measure improvements in that metric in our model?","Chris Lafond","Hi, Kelly. It\u2019s Chris.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi.","Chris Lafond","Yeah, great question and so as you know \u2013 we certainly accelerated and had to do lot of hiring of new people in the first part of this year and when you look at sales productivity, we\u2019ve certainly had a much richer mix of new people versus existing people and so that certainly has an impact as you look quarter-to-quarter on how that productivity measure trends. So our trend continues to move ahead. So productivity is moving as we had expected to move, we certainly expect as we get into the back half of the year that of all of those people become fully trained, get more productive, we start to see that productivity increase as we go through the year. So and then obviously we\u2019ll depend on how many more sales people we add towards the back half of the year or early next year.","So there is a number of factors that will affect that and it\u2019s a question of when those people come on board, what that mix looks like. As we talk about all the time, I think the key thing for everybody to remember is, growing your sales force 15% to 20% with normal sales force turnover in the 15%, 17% range, you are going to have 35%-ish of your sales force in the first year, that\u2019s a big number to manage. And that will move over time depending on when we bring those people in and that will impact the quarterly productivity numbers. So I think for us the key is to keep watching, to make sure that as we look at the details below it as in terms of the productivity of new people, productivity as people go through their tenure that we feel those things are moving in the right direction and that\u2019s exactly what we feel today.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank so much. That was helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And your question comes from Brian Karimzad, Goldman Sachs. Thank you.","Brian Karimzad \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning. So on that net new salesperson you\u2019re putting on the ground. Can you get more specific on what types of opportunities and framework of opportunities you are putting against \u2013 them against versus the existing sales force? And then on the training side, to the extent you needed to make adjustment there, are you ready if you need you to put some work expense behind accelerating some efforts there and making sure the productivity gets up to speed in the short-term and get 2013 on track?","Eugene Hall","Yeah. Hi, Brian. It\u2019s Gene. So first on the opportunity side, we have identified today 108,000 institutions as potential clients, of which only about 27,000 are actually assigned to a sales territory today. And so as we add new salespeople, we have plenty and plenty of opportunities, we know where there are today, it\u2019s just a matter of we don\u2019t have enough salespeople yet. So when we bring the salespeople on, we do one or two things.","We take some of those new territories, some of that, roughly 70,000 institutions that are not yet assigned to a salesperson. The other thing we do is, as Chris mentioned, we have normal sales force turnover and so when somebody leaves us we obviously replace them with another sales person and they get that. And so it\u2019s a combination of \u2013 it could be replacing an the existing sales territory or we could be bringing a whole new territory. And that happens in the U.S., it happens in Europe and it happens in Asia, all three of those.","With respect to training, we have a huge \u2013 we know that we want to have \u2013 grow our sales force 15% to 20% a year and we\u2019re going to have order of magnitude 15% turnover which is again normal turnover. So as Chris said, we\u2019re going to have like 30% or 35% people in their first year every year. So, recruiting and training are a huge focus for us and we have taken our training program from very basic five years ago to being what people \u2013 when we hire experience sales \u2013 when they go through our training program, they say it\u2019s the best training program they have ever seen. And, we\u2019re not stopping there. We know, to your point, how important it is and so we\u2019ll continue to enhance those programs over time, it\u2019s a source of continuing investments it\u2019s not static in anyway whatsoever.","Same thing with recruiting by the way, we are always focused on how do we identify people that are most likely to be successful, how do we get better, better and better over time, so our sales force turnover is lower and our initial productivity is higher.","Brian Karimzad \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And Chris for those of us keeping the box score, if we wanted to include the acquisition, the Ideas acquisition in our ACV number, it looks like it was about $9 million revenue run rate last year. Is that kind of a fair amount to kind of pop in there as we back it out?","Chris Lafond","Their revenue is not all Research revenue, they have some Consulting and other revenues and so, what I would \u2013 what I would say, as we talked about earlier, it\u2019s not material to the results. So, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not going to move the needle either way.","Brian Karimzad \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Dan Leben, Robert W Baird. Your line is open.","Dan Leben \u2013 Robert W Baird","Great, thanks for taking my question. Gene, you talked about the sales productivity having some variances between the size of customers. Could you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing there and any trends within the different customer sizes?","Eugene Hall","No, I mean I think basically it\u2019s the same trends we\u2019ve seen, there\u2019s nothing new there. Basically the \u2013 and I think that\u2019s true about the customer size and by geography. Some geographies, our sales \u2013 we\u2019ll use more selling by telephones like that and so no material change in that at all.","Dan Leben \u2013 Robert W Baird","Okay. And can you just give us an indication of the magnitude of the contract optimization that we should think about being additive to the third quarter, those bigger deals that slipped?","Chris Lafond","Hey, it\u2019s Chris. So, just when you look at the contract optimization business, if you look at it standalone just remember contract optimization is kind of 10%, 15% of the overall Consulting business so that\u2019s the kind of magnitude. That business was down probably 20% to 25% year-over-year, so there\u2019s probably $3 million to $4 million of immediate impact of things that we think will slip from \u2013 did slip and we\u2019re already seeing coming into Q3.","Dan Leben \u2013 Robert W Baird","Great, thanks. And last one from me, just on the Consulting backlog, down a little bit sequentially and just if you could talk a little bit about, is there an FX impact in the backlog as well as just overall trends down a couple of quarters in a row from a really strong number in the fourth quarter?","Chris Lafond","Yeah. So, just a couple of points on backlog. The first thing that\u2019s really important to note is the months of backlog, so we\u2019re still trending at around four months which is exactly where we want to be. So, we feel really good about the months of backlog that we have. FX is a pretty minimal impact to backlog, so I wouldn\u2019t say that that was a driver. If you look back we had a particularly strong Q1 in Europe with backlog, so we certainly expected to work some of that backlog down. And so from where we are today, we feel very confident that the backlog is where it should be and it\u2019s supporting what we think we should be delivering in the back half of the year.","Dan Leben \u2013 Robert W Baird","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Eric Boyer, Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yeah. Thanks. So can you remind us what the tax rate assumption was for the year and then what you\u2019re now expecting for 2012?","Chris Lafond","Yeah. The tax rate \u2013 the effective tax rate of 32% to 33% and we still expect to be in that range. It was a little lower this quarter because we had some credits that were booked this quarter related to our Stamford headquarters and some credits we received from the State of Connecticut. So, but overall we\u2019ll be still in that 32% to 33% range.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo","And then just on the sales force growth, could you talk about the areas where you\u2019re focusing the most in terms of verticals and geographies?","Eugene Hall","Hey, it\u2019s Gene. So, the \u2013 we are growing our sales force basically everywhere, in geographies, everywhere and sized companies and everywhere in industries because there\u2019s opportunities in all those spaces and \u2013 it\u2019s operationally. So for example, we don\u2019t want to grow one team 50% \u2013 if we\u2019re going to average 15% to 20%. We don\u2019t really want to grow one team 70% or 80% and one team 5% because the team that\u2019s growing 70% or 80% would be very hard operationally to manage. So, we try to keep all the industries and all the verticals and all the geographies growing in kind of a range. That range could be higher than our talk of higher than 20% in some very fast growing particular markets. But, and could be a little bit low if we see that there\u2019s an area where we think operationally the team needs to some changes before we had a lot of head count. But, you can think about we\u2019re growing in all the geographies, all the industries and all-size clients.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Could you give us a sense of some of those faster growing markets you just talked about?","Eugene Hall","Yeah. So, it won\u2019t surprise you. It\u2019s places that are the faster growing economies in the world. For example, in some parts of Asia, we\u2019d be at the higher end of those ranges as opposed to the lower end of the range. We\u2019ve grown very \u2013 People\u2019s Republic of China, for example, we\u2019ve grown faster than the kind of 20% that we talked about there.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, and then are you seeing any change in the pace of opportunities adding the sales pipeline for either Research or Consulting?","Eugene Hall","Well, I mean basically we have a very robust pipeline and we track this very systemically in terms of opportunities and it looks very robust.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo","And then just the length of the sales cycle, any changes there other than that one piece of the Consulting business you talked about?","Eugene Hall","Yeah, I would say, no \u2013 no changes in selling cycle, one of the things that we\u2019ve gotten very good at in this economy is where clients have cost problems they need to deal with, budget problems they need to deal with, we know how to talk with them and how to make sure we\u2019re helping with them in being front and center or as part of the solution and so, even in areas where there are big budget concerns and things like that we\u2019re pretty good at addressing those. So, yeah, no change in the selling cycle we\u2019re seeing.","Eric Boyer \u2013 Wells Fargo","All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Bill Sutherland, Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thank you.","Bill Sutherland \u2013 Northland Securities","Chris, just a quick follow up, because I think I may have missed your commentary about FX impact in the second half of the year either revenue or CV?","Chris Lafond","Hey Bill, it\u2019s Chris, effectively we don\u2019t try to forecast foreign exchange; we never have. So, basically we look at where the exchange rates are today and we look forward and so all of our current assumptions assume, FX is kind of where it is today. If it moves dramatically, we\u2019ll come back and tell you what the impact is. If you look at where we are through the first half in the second quarter, we probably had a kind of 3 to 4 point impact on top line, similar impact on expense and not a huge impact on the bottom line, but we\u2019ll see where it goes for the remainder of the year.","Bill Sutherland \u2013 Northland Securities","So from \u2013 I guess on that, given rates where they are today, what would it do to the second half?","Chris Lafond","Well, we just reconfirmed our guidance that we put out, so right now we still believe with the foreign exchange at the levels they are today, we will still be in the range of the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year.","Bill Sutherland \u2013 Northland Securities","Okay. Thanks, Chris.","Chris Lafond","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) There are no other questions waiting at the moment. Thank you.","Brian Shipman","Okay. Thanks for joining us, everyone.

With me today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer.

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Well, thanks for joining us today. At our Investor Day earlier this year, we laid out a plan to continue driving-double digit profitable growth to Gartner's traditional business while applying the Gartner formula to accelerate the former CEB business. Today, you'll hear how we continue to be on track on both objectives.","We delivered another great quarter of double-digit growth in Q2 of 2018. Our revenue grew 14% and EBITDA 11%. EPS grew 17% compared to last year. We generated more than $210 million of free cash flow year-to-date. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Once again, our Research segment had strong performance, with revenue growth of 14% and contract value growth of 12%.","As we previously discussed, we now manage the Research sales force by Global Technology Sales or GTS, which is sales to users and providers of technology, and Global Business Sales or GBS, which includes sales to all other functions. GTS had another strong quarter. GTS contract value accelerated from Q1 and grew 14%, with a double-digit growth in every region, every size clients, and in virtually every industry. GTS client retention was 82% and wallet retention 105%, both near all-time highs.","Our GTS sales head count grew 9% year-over-year, and we expect this to accelerate in Q3. This provides the foundation for sustained double-digit growth. Even as we've expanded the GTS team, productivity has improved, up 10% in Q2 to $111,000 per salesperson. As we've discussed, we have enormous growth opportunity by applying the Gartner formula to GBS. We developed an aggressive blueprint to capture this opportunity and accelerate GBS to a sustained double-digit growth. We are executing well in meeting or exceeding our expectations on implementing this blueprint.","In the quarter, after we closed the CEB acquisition, we eliminated discounting and aligned terms and conditions with Gartner standards. We immediately began developing a new set of seat-based products, including Gartner for HR Leaders, Gartner for Finance Leaders and others. In Q4 2017, we pilot tested these new products with great feedback from clients and sales people. We pilot tested service elements from the Gartner formula. Retention of these pilot clients were several percentage points higher than comparable clients without these service improvements.","During that time, we also expanded our sales recruiting organization and began accelerated hiring. In the first quarter of 2018, we trained GBS sales people on these great new products. Our sales hiring continued. And by the end of Q2, our GBS sales force had grown by 24%. All of the new products include the service elements of the Gartner formula and we're rolling out service elements with the remaining legacy products. All of these changes are proceeding as or better than planned.","As I mentioned, our priority is positioning GBS for sustained double-digit growth as soon as practical. As expected, these changes had some short-term impact with GBS contract value growth of 4% in Q2. There were two primary things that impacted GBS contract value growth in Q2. First, to grow the GBS sales force 24%, we needed a sizable number of additional managers. As is our usual practice, the promoted managers were selected from our highest performing sales people. The new manager's former positions were then backfilled with new hires. New sales hires particularly in their first few months on average have low sales productivity. As new sales people get experienced, their productivity rapidly accelerates.","Second, GBS sales people are very early in the learning curve, transitioning from the legacy products to the new seat-based products. As I just discussed, GBS sales people were trained on the new products in Q1. So most had their first opportunity to make a sale during Q2 and selling cycles are often longer than a single quarter. We note that the pilot testing last year and our past experience with similar transitions that they'll come up the learning curve quickly. Even with the GBS sales force having a much lower average tenure and being early on the learning curve selling seat-based products, leading indicators are strong. Total sales to new clients increased by more than 20% during Q2 compared to Q1. And our seat-based products represented more than half of these sales. Sales of our seat-based products to existing clients grew about 80% in Q2 compared to Q1, and were about one-third of total sales to existing clients.","We developed a blueprint to implement the Gartner formula in GBS. And with the changes we've already made, we're well positioned for future sustained, double-digit growth. Our new seat-based products provide much greater value to clients, which will drive both accelerated new business and stronger retention. Our sales force expansion will allow us to enter 2019 with sales force that is about 24% larger than we had in 2017. This expanded sales force will be more tenured, trained and experienced in selling these great new products. All the new products as well as a significant amount of the legacy products will have service support for the Gartner formula, which will drive improved retention. With our aggressive implementation of the Gartner formula, we continue to expect double-digit growth in GBS contract value next year, and at least 12% growth in 2020.","Our Events segment combines the outstanding value of Research with the immersive experience of live events, making every conference we produce the most important gathering for the executives we serve. Our Events segment had another strong quarter. Revenues grew 17%. During the quarter, we held 24 destination events, with attendance growing 13% compared to Q2 last year. On a same-event basis, attendance grew 16% year-over-year. Revenue for Evanta continues to see double-digit growth and the forward-looking metrics for our Events segment remained strong.","The Gartner Consulting segment is an extension of Gartner Research and provides clients a deeper level of involvement through extended project-based work to help them execute on their most strategic initiatives. Our Consulting segment had a solid quarter with Q2 Consulting revenues growing 5%. Our labor-based business had a strong performance, growing 13%. Our contract optimization business had the second highest quarter for their business in the past five years, although down 17% year-over-year because we had our strongest quarter a year ago. Q2 Consulting bookings remained strong with backlog up 16%.","In summary, I continue to be excited about our business, our prospects for growth and our strategy to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Our strong Q2 results demonstrate we know the right things to do to drive success in our business by applying the Gartner formula. With the capability to address critical client needs in technology and in business across every major function in the enterprise, we remain in an outstanding position to provide sustained double-digit growth across all our key metrics.","And with that introduction, I'll now turn over the call to Craig Safian, our Chief Financial Officer.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We continue to see robust demand for our services across the globe. During the second quarter, we saw a year-over-year acceleration in our contract value and very good financial results across our three primary operating segments. And as our 2018 outlook continues to demonstrate, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth with strong cash flow generation.","Second quarter revenue was $1 billion, up 14% and up 12% on an FX-neutral basis. The purchase accounting adjustment for deferred revenue was down to $1 million for the quarter. Also in the second quarter, we delivered contribution margins of 63%, up modestly from the prior year, EBITDA of $191 million, up 11% year-over-year, and adjusted EPS of $1.03 per share, up 17% versus the prior year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $183 million.","Research had another excellent quarter, with significant year-over-year growth in revenue and improvements in contribution margin. Research revenue grew 14% in the second quarter and 12% on an FX-neutral basis. The contribution margin for Research was 69%. Total contract value was $2.9 billion at June 30, growth of 12% versus the prior year. We always report contract value growth in FX-neutral terms.","New business growth was very strong in Global Technology Sales. We continue to see a healthy mix of new business across new clients, sales of additional services, and upgrades to existing clients. The average contract value for enterprise also continues to grow. It now stands at $195,000 per enterprise, up 6% versus the prior year. This continued and consistent increase in average spend, reflects our ability to drive CV growth both through new and existing enterprises.","I'll now review the details of our performance for both GTS and GBS. In the second quarter, GTS contract value growth accelerated to 14%. GTS now has contract value of $2.3 billion. Client retention for GTS remained strong at 82%. Wallet retention for GTS was 105% for the quarter, up almost 80 basis points year-over-year and at an all-time high. These retention rates reflect a combination of greater spending and greater retention rates with our higher spending and larger clients. GTS growth in new business was 16% in the second quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter as our sales team continues to execute very well. We ended the second quarter with 12,375 GTS clients, up 6% compared to Q2 2017.","Our investments to improve sales force productivity continued to pay off with an increase again this quarter. For GTS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing head count was $111,000 per salesperson, up 10% versus the second quarter of last year.","Turning to Global Business Sales. As of June 30, GBS had contract value of $611 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4%. Since the third quarter of last year, we have made a number of changes and operational improvements to follow the Gartner growth formula that we detailed at Investor Day. All these changes and improvements position us for sustained, long-term, double-digit growth.","We continue to make good progress with GBS retention metrics. And for deals up for renewal in the quarter, we saw significant improvement both year-over-year and sequentially. GBS client retention was 83%, up more than 370 basis points from the prior year. GBS wallet retention was 97%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year and down sequentially. The sequential decline in wallet retention was due to lower new business sales to existing clients.","New business declined by 19% in the quarter versus the prior year, primarily due to declines in legacy product sales. As Gene detailed, we are seeing a number of positive trends within our new business results. First, new business to new clients was up more than 20% sequentially, driven by significant growth in seat-based products. The seat-based products made up greater than 50% of new business sales to new clients in the second quarter.","Second, while new business to existing clients was down 40% sequentially from Q1, seat-based new business to existing clients was up 80% sequentially. Though that growth wasn't fast enough to compensate for the decline of new business of the legacy products, the uptake of the new seat-based products are trending in the right direction. These seat-based product results are particularly encouraging given the context that Gene described around the GBS sales forces' lower tenure and coming up the learning curve on selling seat-based products.","We ended the second quarter with 5,659 GBS enterprise clients, up 1% versus the prior-year period. For GBS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing head count was $37,000, down 23% versus second quarter last year. The decline in productivity reflects the operational shifts we have the sales team making to the new Gartner seat-based products. The operational changes we've made are all part of the Gartner formula for growth. And our data and analytics show that as our sellers gain more experience with the new products, their productivity improves.","Our Research business performance in Q2 was strong. GTS was outstanding with increases in wallet retention and sales productivity and an acceleration in contract value growth. For GBS, the early indications reinforced our outlook for double-digit contract value growth next year and 12-plus-percent growth in 2020.","In Events, revenues increased by 17% year-on-year in Q2 to $111 million. FX-neutral growth was 16%. Events second quarter gross contribution margin was 57%, stable with last year's quarter. The second quarter is typically our second largest quarter of the year after the fourth quarter. We had two fewer destination events than last year. On a same-event, FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 15%, with a 16% increase in same-event attendees. Q2 was strong for our Events business and the forward-looking metrics also remain robust.","Second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 5% to $96 million. FX-neutral growth was about 2%. Labor-based revenues were $77 million. In the labor-based business, revenues increased 13% versus Q2 of last year or 9% on a FX-neutral basis. On the labor-based side, billable head count of 710 was up 7% and we had 135 managing partners at the end of Q2, up about 5% versus the prior year.","Backlog, which measures labor-based projects under contract where there is more work to be done, is the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business. Backlog ended the quarter at $106 million, up 16% year-over-year and 11% in FX-neutral terms. Our booking performance remains strong and our 2018 pipeline is encouraging. The contract optimization business was down 17% versus the prior year quarter due to a very tough compare. Overall, Consulting gross contribution margin was 35% in the second quarter.","Revenue in the Other segment increased by 29% compared to the year-ago quarter to $22 million. Gross contribution margin was 68%. Early in the second quarter, we divested CEB Talent Assessment for about $400 million and CEB Workforce Surveys for $28 million. On a GAAP basis, SG&A increased by 13% year-over-year in the second quarter and 11% on an FX-neutral basis. Adjusting for the divestitures and other nonrecurring items, SG&A increased 14% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis.","We continue to grow sales capacity and the enabling infrastructure to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long-term. The enabling infrastructure includes investments in human resources functions like recruiting and real estate to support the increased number of associates around the world.","Our sales force continues to be our largest investment. And at the end of the second quarter, we had 3,595 quota-bearing associates across Gartner in GTS and GBS. This includes 2,801 in GTS and 794 in GBS or a growth of 9% and 24%, respectively. The GTS growth will increase in the second half as we still expect mid-teens growth for GTS head count for 2018.","EBITDA for the second quarter was $191 million, up 11% with strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher SG&A costs as expected. Depreciation, amortization and integration expenses were down year-over-year as we get past the one year anniversary of the CEB acquisition, and as a result of the recent divestitures. Interest expense in the quarter was $38 million, down from $44 million in the second quarter of 2017. The lower interest expense relates to paying down debt over the past year.","Our tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 27.9% for the quarter. As we'll discuss in the outlook section, we still expect our adjusted tax rate to be about 26% for the full year. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $1.03 with upside relative to our expectations, primarily from a few items below the EBITDA line. In Q2, operating cash flow was $174 million compared to $112 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was driven by strong operating results, lower interest expense and improvements and catch up in working capital.","Q2 2018 CapEx was $22 million, and Q2 cash acquisition and integration payments and other non-recurring items were approximately $31 million. This yields Q2 free cash flow of $183 million, which is up over 40% versus the prior-year quarter.","In the second quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program, buying about 500,000 shares for $68 million. We have over $1 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. During the second quarter of 2018, we repaid $554 million worth of debt, leaving our June 30th debt balance at about $2.5 billion. That's down more than $1.1 billion since the acquisition a little more than a year ago. Adjusting EBITDA for the divestitures, our gross leverage ratio is now about 3.6 times EBITDA and we are tracking to our target of about 3 times, which we continue to expect to see by the end of 2018.","Turning to the outlook for 2018. Revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS guidance remain the same. The only updates we are making are to our GAAP EPS guidance range to reflect the modest changes arising from the divestitures, use of divestiture proceeds and some updates to other expenses. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar that we saw over the course of the second quarter, we do expect to see our top-line reported results impacted modestly in the second half of the year by foreign exchange. As you update your models for Q3 and Q4, please keep in mind that our original estimates for reported revenues, reported expenses and reported EBITDA will be impacted by about 1% due to the stronger U.S. dollar.","The highlights of our annual guidance are as follows. For 2018, we continue to expect adjusted revenues of approximately $3.9 billion to $4 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $710 million to $760 million. Amortization will take a noticeable step down from about $49 million in Q3 to about $35 million in Q4. We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of around 26% for the full year. Please note that if you are adding back from GAAP net income, the rate for the tax effect on the add back from the second half of the year is about 23%.","We expect full year 2018 adjusted EPS of between $3.51 per share and $3.91 per share. We expect free cash flow of $416 million to $456 million. At the midpoint, the conversion from adjusted net income is 126%. And lastly for the third quarter of 2018, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.58 and $0.62 per share. All the details of our guidance are included in the press release and our quarterly earnings deck, both of which are available on our Investor Relations site.","We've had a great start to the year, with strength across all of our operating segments and improvements in most of our key operating measures. Notably, GTS contract value growth accelerated to 14% in the second quarter and sales of our new seat-based products in GBS continue to scale. Free cash flow also improved significantly in the quarter. We've also divested a number of non-core assets and used those proceeds to rapidly delever. We've reduced our debt balance by more than $800 million in 2018. The trends going into the third quarter are strong and our teams are working hard to execute the 2018 plan. As we shared with you at Investor Day, we are applying the Gartner growth formula across the combined business to drive sustained, long-term, double-digit growth to revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Just want to ask I guess a little more color on the GBS side. I know you gave some explanation, but just I guess, what caused those headwinds to get bigger in Q2 versus Q1 especially I guess as it relates to promotions and so forth? Any more color there would be helpful. Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Tim. It's Gene. So, as I mentioned earlier, there were two things that really hit in Q2. So, first, we hired a bunch of sales people beginning in Q4. Those people actually came on board and went through training in Q1 and then we identified \u2013 when they came on board, we had to have some managers for them. We generally promote our managers from our highest performing sales people, which we did. And so what you'd imagine is if you take your highest performing sales people and then promote them managers, so they're not selling any more. They are managers. Replace them with somebody that just got through training. Someone just through training doesn't sell nearly as much as somebody who has been one of our highest performers. And it can be \u2013 it's a big delta. And so, if you look at comparisons, again, you take your highest performers, you replace with brand new people. That's one factor.","The second factor is that, as we mentioned, we had developed these new seat-based products, we piloted them in Q4 last year. They did very well. We rolled them out in Q1 and Q2. In Q1, our sales force \u2013 the GBS sales force was getting trained. So they were still mostly some of the legacy products because they were getting trained on the new products. In Q2, they could actually start selling the new products. Again a few of them made sales in Q1 right after training, most didn't until Q2. And so, as they made the transition obviously with the new product at seat-based as opposed to enterprise agreements and a different kind of product, there's a learning curve for it. And so, those were the two primary factors that impact us. So, first, we promoted some of our highest performers to be managers and replaced them with brand new people. And secondly, we made the transition from mostly legacy product sales to actually now the seat-based sales and there's a bit of a learning curve there. As Craig and I both highlighted, the initial results on selling the new seat-based products are very strong and we're very happy about that.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just on the Q3 guidance, I guess on profit margins, I'm not sure if the exact margin implied about the Q3 guide, but I think given year-to-date results plus that EPS guidance, I guess unless margins are up a lot in Q4, is the indication the lower end of the margin guide is more likely at this point, any color on that? Thanks.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Tim. Thanks for the question. I think the way to think about it is as we talked about I think last year post the acquisition, there's a little more seasonality in our revenue, particularly driven by Events and Consulting, since the acquisition with Q2 and Q4 now, by far, being our largest revenue and profit quarters, and Q4 by a long way. And so when we have a relatively fixed SG&A base across each of the four quarters, when the revenue spikes, as it does in Q2 and Q4, the margins look better than the average. And when the revenue is lower a little bit in the smaller quarters for us, Q1 and Q3, the margins are down. And so I think the way we're thinking about it is we're still, if you look at the midpoint of our annual guidance, it still calls for stable margins for the full-year and that's essentially the way we are thinking about it.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. So I think I'm a little confused on the GBS selling activity. So the sales people are used to selling enterprise-wide and it sounds like that's what's taken a hit, and they're doing well with the new seat-based sales. But I guess what's the message or the incentive structure to the sales force, like, are you \u2013 I think you're allowing them to still sell both either seat-based or enterprise-wide, but how are you incenting it or how are you messaging it, like, are you still allowing them to sell it, but you're paying more incentive for seat-based? Just trying to understand why something they're more comfortable with is where we're seeing the bigger hit.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So Jeff, it's Gene. So during Q1 and Q2, we allowed our sales force to sell both the legacy product and the new seat-based product. The reason we did that is they were only trained on the new seat-based products in Q1 and so they had to have something to sell in the meantime. And then we let them keep selling the legacy product in Q2 because they had pipelines where they'd already introduced the product \u2013 the legacy products to clients. In the middle of a selling cycle, we didn't want to have them change. So, we, for those reasons, allowed them to sell both products during Q1 and Q2. As I mentioned, Q1 was mostly the legacy products, because they hadn't yet been trained on the new products in general. And Q2, we saw a steep ramp up to material shares that we talked about of our new business in Q2.","The incentives are exactly the same. Meaning, that if you sell the legacy product or you sell the new seat-based product, the commission structure and the incentive structure is exactly the same, there's no difference. So, salesperson on an economic basis is indifferent which one they sell. If you're a salesperson, it's a lot better to sell the new seat-based products because we believe they're going to have better retention because they provide better value to clients, and they provide better growth opportunities for the future. So, even though they're incented to saying, our sales people understand why the new products provide more value to our clients. And once they got trained on it that would be the preference for selling. Beginning July 1, for where we have \u2013 the majority of our sales people, they'll be selling just the seat-based products.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, was it basically that sometime during the first half of the year, as your sales force was developing pipeline, they were developing it with the intention of seat-based sales and that was the conversation, so the pipeline started to dry up previously for enterprise-wide sales and that's why it's taking the hit. Is that the fair characterization?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","That's a piece of it. I think a bigger piece is, when you're selling enterprise agreement, the value proposition to the client is more along the lines of, if you buy this, everyone in the organization can use this. That's a different value proposition than I'm selling this to you individually for your personal use. And by the way, the personal use product has many more features and content than the enterprise-wide product. So, it's a different sale. And so there's a combination of once you start talking to a client about here's what I want to sell you, you have a pipeline for that product, if you then change from \u2013 you don't want to change that same client from enterprise to seat. So they started \u2013 at the beginning of the year, they hadn't been trained on seat, so they had a pipeline that was mostly for the legacy products. Once they got trained, then they started developing pipelines for the new products.","And so there's the pipeline change, in addition as I mentioned, there's a learning curve. What we've seen from experience is the first sale is the one that is the most important, because once our sales people make their first sale, they develop confidence about how to talk about it with clients. And then the second sale is easier and the third sale is even easier than that. And what we saw in Q2 is a very large portion of our sales force making their first sale of a seat-based product, GBS.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, guys. So maybe just to ask a different way, I guess these changes you're making, seat-based hiring, they're all sort of what you planned. But was this deceleration in 2Q like pretty much in line with what you were expecting or did it go a little worse than maybe what you had planned? I know you reiterated the full-year guidance, so will there be like a catch-up towards the end of the year in your expectation?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So we made the changes that we expected to make, and the impact had the impact we expected. I'd sort of leave it at that. In terms of \u2013 I don't know how to think about catch-up, but it's kind of like we're on plan with what we expected. We wanted to make these changes. We had an aggressive plan. We made them exactly as we expected. They're going as well or better than we expected in terms of making these changes. In fact, I had a \u2013 one of the things that really made me feel good about these things is we had a meeting with our senior leaders in July, where I got together with the senior GBS leaders from around the world, senior sales leaders. And their level of enthusiasm about the new products and how much value they add to clients and their future was extremely high. And it's great, when you have your senior sales leaders are all very excited about this transition of new products, it makes you feel very confident we're on the right track.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then maybe, Craig, just for you. I mean small repurchase this quarter. When do you think we get back to sort of the level of activity you guys used to do before the deal?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Manav. Thanks. The way that we think about deployment of capital is as we get down to our overall leverage target, which as we've talked about is about 3 times EBITDA on a gross leverage basis we're going to deploy our capital in two ways. Number one, looking at strategic value enhancing M&A that either fills in gaps or can accrete our top line and bottom line or things like that and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchasing. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have over $1 billion of authorization remaining. And the way we think about it is, we will deploy our capital very similar to the way we did prior to the acquisition as we reduce our leverage and get down to our target levels.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You've indicated that overall GBS sales force productivity was impacted by the promotion of your highest performing sales people to managers and then these people were backfilled with new sales. Can you comment on trends in sales force productivity among your non-promoted sales people and how their productivity tracked versus last quarter and your own internal expectations?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, I think one of the best ways to look at it is we had a pilot of the new seat-based products last year, as I mentioned. And if you look at the productivity of those people who now \u2013 we introduced it to them in the fourth quarter, they started selling the seat-based products. If you look at their productivity in the second quarter, it is whole numbers are better than the new people would be. And so, it gives us confidence in the fact, as people get experience with this, they come up the curve very quickly.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","The other thing, George, that I \u2013 just to add to that, when we look at our sales to new clients, sequentially, we saw a really nice increase in the new business, the absolute dollars from Q1 to Q2 of that group of sellers, and the mix shifted pretty significantly too with a majority of the Q2 new business to new clients being in our \u2013 sorry to use new again, new seat-based product. So, you asked a really good question around the underlying trends. The underlying trends are very positive, and everything we see analytically both from experience and what we're seeing now with the current GBS sales force is as they get more time or more tenure, their productivity does improve.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's very helpful context. You're, obviously, in the process now of transitioning from enterprise to seat-based licensing. Can you talk about, generally, what the client take rate is on these new contract terms? What proportion of contracts or clients that you're going out to are converting under these new terms?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, as I mentioned earlier, sales people that are already been talking to a client about enterprise agreements, they can continue those and close those as we switch and again we're ending that as of July 1. As Craig mentioned earlier, and when we have a new client situation between Q1 and Q2, our sales to new clients were up 20% \u2013 more than 20% year-over-year as I mentioned in my remarks. And in Q2, the proportion of new seat-based sales was more than half of those sales. So, again, the total actual dollars were up more than 20% year-over-year. And in Q2 for new clients, the mix was more than half of the new seat-based products. In fact \u2013 and the reason that we're ending legacy products is just they were already in the pipeline, we'd already been discussing with clients. So the uptake is very positive.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. I guess the question is more qualitative. Are clients receptive to this new kind of seat-based structure in your conversations?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yes. And again, great question. So clients love the new seat-based products and the reason is that they provide a lot more value. And the actual product itself, again, as you'll recall, we took Research from Heritage Gartner on the technology side. So, for example, HR on HR information systems and analytics in HR added that to what CEB had already had and then we actually changed the structure of the product even within the CEB piece. So if you look at actually the seat-based product, that's a much higher value product than the legacy product we had before. And so, when we talked \u2013 the reason the uptake has been very positive to new clients is, when new clients see this and then when you sell it to the individual for their personal use, they really understand the value, then the reception has been very, very positive which is why you've seen the statistics I mentioned earlier, where total new business is actually up 20% year-over-year in GBS for new clients.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Gene, you mentioned the July 1st date a couple of times in the last question and earlier. But just so I'm clear, that's when the sales people are not able to sell the enterprise licenses anymore? Is that how to think about that July 1 change?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, for our larger products, HR, finance, legal, sales, marketing, et cetera, we gave until July 1 for our sales people to close out any deals they had in the pipeline with the legacy products. There is still some very small legacy products, but it's a small portion. So it's not literally zero but a small portion of our product is still legacy. Over time, those will be converted. The vast majority and all the big important ones will be on the seat-based products starting July 1. That's the only thing we'll sell starting July 1.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","From a new business perspective.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","From a new business perspective. Yeah. Again, people can renew \u2013 our global clients renew their legacy products as long as they want to renew them.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And the fact that the new seat-based product sales are going so well, it shouldn't have \u2013 you're not expecting a very negative impact on Q3 from like basically this changeover day?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, again, we feel like we're in a very good trajectory, where the sales force understands that they're getting more experienced and for new sales to new clients, we actually had great results. And so, we're feeling very good about it.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And just my follow-up is, were there any particular functional areas within GBS that were particularly strong this quarter or any that were particularly slower, that be helpful.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","I'd say everything was in trend. I can't think there were any differences. If you look at the differences between the seat-based and the legacy products or even the trend overall, it's kind of in trend with where it's been.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So, nothing to call out on like marketing versus supply chain versus...?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","No. I think, again, everything I would say is in trend with where it's been historically.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sorry to go back to this GBS sales issue, just one minor question. If I look at the GBS sales force today, roughly what percentage of those folks are new versus those that came from CEB?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, I don't have those numbers right in front of me, but the way to think about it is, we grew it 24% year-over-year, so you know 24% are new, plus we promoted a number of people into managers (44:00), so their replacements are new. And plus we had sales force turnover which is in the range of what our Gartner sales force turnover has been historically. So, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but if you think about that we had growth plus we had replacement as we promoted people, plus we had normal turnover, and so it's a big proportion of people to new. And, by the way, we're used to this. This is how Gartner's worked for a decade. And so, we know how to run that kind of an organization and things are going, as I said, as we would expect.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. I guess where I was going with the question is if I look over time, when do you think the GBS sales force will be comprised of mostly new folks as opposed to CEB legacy sales?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, let me give you an illustrative example because, again, I don't have the exact numbers right in front of me. But if you have a business that you want to grow the sales head count 15% net and you have 15% turnover and 15% promotions, so if I start with 100 people and lose 15% for turnover, I promote 15% and I want to grow 15%, I have to hire 45 people to grow 100 people to 115 people. 45 divided by 115 is 39% \u2013 is 40%. So under the theoretical assumption I just gave you, 15% growth in net head count, 15% turnover, 15% promotions, 40% of people are the first year all the time. Again, this is how we run Gartner forever, but that gives you sort of a flavor for it.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I appreciate that. And where are you finding these new GBS sales people?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, we have a world-class recruiting organization. And, in fact, I think about our recruiting organization as being a real source of competitive advantage for us. We focused on building it for a number of years. And as you know, the labor markets are quite tight. Despite the fact that labor markets are tight, as you've heard, we're growing our total sales force significantly in both GTS and GBS. And all of our metrics in terms of the quality of the people are stronger and stronger as in the past. We find our sales people from all over. As you know, we operate \u2013 we have clients in 100 countries, we operate in many of those directly, and so we hire people all around the world. So, it's not kind of one source, because we're operating in all these different markets, we sell large clients, medium clients, small clients. Those are different sources. So there's kind of like, not one source, it depends on what geography it is and what size clients that we're serving, et cetera.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey guys. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Does GBS wallet retention have any structural changes that would keep it from getting to where GTS is running currently?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","No, I think we believe that the wallet retention in GBS, there's no reason why it can't be the same over time as what we see in GTS. And in fact, two primary things we believe will unlock that. Number one is you're driving the normal Gartner growth formula around engagement and service and all those things have been translating into higher retention rates, and there's still room to improve there.","And the second thing is, and this is one of the other benefits of transitioning to seat-based products, is with an enterprise license, once you penetrated the organization, there's really no more growth to go. Gartner historically has derived about two-thirds of its gross growth from further penetration of existing enterprises. And with the new seat-based products, we'll now be able to run that play on the GBS side as well. So, that was a longwinded answer to your question which I could have just said, no, there is no reason why GBS wallet retention can't get to the same levels as GTS wallet retention.","Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got you. Perfect. And just a quick follow up. Given the divestitures in some of the noncore assets, could you walk us through how you think about further portfolio pruning if there maybe is any and how robust does your future pipeline look in terms of M&A? And if that is the case, do you see yourself adding any (48:27) to the portfolio?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. From a divestiture perspective, the biggest one for us was the Talent Assessment business which was by far the biggest business within Heritage CEB that we deemed as noncore. We worked very quickly to do the analysis to figure out that it was noncore and then to market and divest that asset. And so getting that completed in early April was kind of mission number one for us. We continue to look at the portfolio to make sure that everything we have is core and really supports the growth of our Research business, which is what all of our other businesses are there to do and we'll continue to look at that.","From an M&A perspective, we continue to track a hundred-plus different companies across all the areas that we now participate in. So not just in IT research, but HR research, finance research, legal research, et cetera. We continue to track those. We have a corp dev team that is all over that. But again, the way we think about M&A going forward is similar to the way we thought about it previously, which was we're going to be really diligent, really disciplined around how we deploy our capital. If there are assets that can fill in gaps for us or accelerate our growth rate and drive real shareholder value, we'll deploy our capital that way. Absent that, we'll look to deploy our capital as we talked about earlier on share repurchases.","Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering if we could get, as best you can, a breakdown of what the growth drivers are. And what I mean by that is how much of your growth is coming from new market penetration versus new products versus industry tailwinds?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Joe. Good morning. Because our portfolio is so diverse now and because technology is ubiquitous regardless of geography, industry, or company size and you can make the same comment for all the other functions we serve like HR and finance and legal. We tend to look at the market as obviously as we've talked about, huge and untapped. And we have a huge opportunity both from a further client penetration perspective and from working with enterprises that currently don't do business with us. And we have ample opportunity on both sides of that equation.","And as I just mentioned, historically, on the Heritage Gartner side, about two-thirds of our growth has come from existing enterprises through a combination of pricing, upgrades of products to higher value, higher priced products, finding new seats within existing buying centers, and finding new buying centers within the existing enterprise. We think that same algorithm or formula applies across GBS as well. And again, it's a combination of new products, of going after the C-level in the organization and then expanding the account below that, all those plays that have worked really well for us, on the Heritage Gartner or GTS side, we think we have available for us on the GBS side as well.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And just as my follow-up, I think we're trying to figure out how much of GBS is sales force versus product. Maybe you could give us some stats. I'm sure CEB is integrated into the whole business now. But any stats you could share with us around CEB, its products or the changes in wallet retention that would help us understand the product side of things a little bit better. Thanks.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Sure, Joe. The way to think about GBS is first its construction was \u2013 it was about 25% supply chain and marketing from the Heritage Gartner side and about 75% of Heritage CEB Leadership Councils. As we talked about, we've started this journey now of really converting everything over to Gartner seat-based products for each of the major functions that we serve. We're very early innings in that game, particularly on the functions that came over from Heritage CEB. But, again, similar to the way we've run it historically in Heritage Gartner and GTS, the growth algorithm is a combination of increased selling capacity because the opportunity is there and then that increased capacity selling the products and services that we have for those particular functions into the function and then expanding within that function. And so, again, it's the same algorithm, as we've talked about and have managed for the last decade or so on the Heritage Gartner\/GTS side.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. I'm wondering if you guys see potential for profitability impact from the shift in the GBS product mix. So, I'm specifically wondering if the higher level of support and service on these newer products perhaps implies a lower level of margin for those products.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Peter. Good question. So, a couple of ways to think about it. One is we price for that, that's baked into the price. And two, we fully anticipate higher retention rates on those products as well. And the combination of the pricing, the scale we'll get and the higher retention rates, we believe that on a combined basis, we can run the overall Research segment at 70% gross margins, both incremental and absolute. With all of that incremental service baked in, again to support the higher retention rates, but again when we build our pricing, we're very cognizant of the elements of the products, service being one of those elements.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Understood. And then the flipside, I guess, to that, Craig, is that it's got all this upfront hiring of sales force in GBS this year. Presumably the sales force growth would slow some next year. I'm wondering if that then potentially helps the margin.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, Peter, it's Gene. As we've talked about in the past in terms of sales force growth, we've increased the GBS sales force growth substantially. We're going to look at what happens to sales productivity. If as through the second half of the year our sales productivity goes up nicely and gets to kind of GTS levels of productivity, then we're going to continue to aggressively grow the GBS sales force. And again, if we believe we can grow it at the same kind of rates we grew it this year, we will do that. But it's all based on seeing the kind of productivity that we expect which again you need to think about it being on par with kind of GTS productivity. And so, we haven't decided yet how much we're going to grow in 2019, because we don't know what those productivities look like yet. And we're prepared to go either way.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Gene Hall for closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Well, I continue to be excited about our business, our prospects for growth, and our strategy to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Our strong Q2 results demonstrate we know the right things to do to drive success in our business by applying the Gartner formula. We have the capability to address critical client needs in technology and in business across every function in the enterprise. And we remain in an outstanding position to provide sustained double-digit growth across all our key metrics.

With me today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer. This call will include a discussion of first quarter 2019 financial results and our current outlook for 2019, as disclosed in today's press release.","In addition to today's press release, we have provided a detailed review of our financials and business metrics in an earnings supplement for investors and analysts. We have posted a press release and the earnings supplement on our website, investor.gartner.com. Following comments by Gene and Craig , we will open up the call for your questions.

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.","Eugene Hall","Good morning and thanks for joining us. We delivered another robust performance in the first quarter of 2019 total revenues were up 11% fueled by double-digit growth in each of our business segments; Research, Conferences, and Consulting. We continue to make a significant global impact. We help more than 15,000 enterprise clients in more than a 100 countries around the world with their mission-critical priorities. We are providing great jobs to more than 15,000 associates globally.","Research, our largest and most profitable segment is the core of our value proposition. Our Research business was up 11% over this time last year. As was described on our Investor Day we have the Gartner formula for sustained double-digit growth to drives success in our Research business. It consists of indispensible insights, exceptional talent, sales excellence, and enabling infrastructure. For each of these elements we drive relentless globally consistent execution at best practices and continuous to improve in innovation.","Global Technology Sales or GTS serves leaders and teams within IT. This group represents more than 80% of our total research contract value. GTS contract value growth accelerated and is more than 14% year-over-year. Sales productivity once again improved. We again delivered double-digit growth in every region across every size company and in virtually every industry.","Global Business Sales or GBS serves leaders and their teams beyond IT and represents about 20% of our total research contract value. This includes supply chain and marketing which we've addressed for several years and as well as other major enterprise roles including HR, finance, legal, sales, and more. Each of these roles has the same need for our services as IT and demand continues to grow.","Our new GXL product line gained momentum. GXL products provide greater value to clients because they are tailored to the clients' individual needs. This in turn results in higher prices per user and stronger retention. Beyond better pricing and retention, GXL products provide exponentially more growth opportunities, because we can sell these high value products throughout our clients' organizations.","At our Investor Day we shared the growth trends of the individual GXL products. Our GXL products continue to accelerate in line with these trends. For Q1 2019, GXL contract value grew 76% year-over-year and new business was up 84%. As expected, legacy products contract value decline. Total GBS contract value improved modestly sequentially as growth in GXL just offset the decline in legacy contract value. We continue to expect double-digit contract value growth in GBS by the end of the year.","Overall our Research segment continues to deliver strong results. Our Conferences segment also delivered a terrific performance in Q1 with double-digit revenue growth of 17%. Garner Conferences combine the outstanding value of our research with immersive experience of live interactions making every conference we produce the most important gathering for the executives we serve. We continue to invest in our conferences portfolio.","In GTS we are expanding our flagship conference, Gartner IT Symposium. This year we are holding IT Symposium Conference in Canada. In GBS we're building out our conference portfolio to align with the GBS roles we serve. In early April we held our Gartner Marketing Symposium. The program featured expanded content coverage including a dedicated track for B2B marketers and one for emerging customer market insights. The results for this conference surpassed expectations. Total attendees were up more than 40% to about 1700 attendees.","We also plan to launch an Executives Summit just for the finance function within the year and we'll continue to expand our GBS conferences over time. In addition to that, we'll continue making investments in the event business.","Our Consulting segment also achieved double-digit growth in Q1 with revenues up 16%. Gartner Consulting is the extension of Gartner Research and provides clients a deeper level of involvement through extended project-based work developed to execute the most strategic initiatives. Our growth in the quarter was a combination of strength and our labor based business and in our contract optimization business.","I recently met with many of our top performing sales people from around the world. This includes sales people from GTS, GBS and Conferences. I continue to be inspired by their energy and passion for serving our clients. They have best-in-class sales goals and they continue to embrace and implement the Gartner formula for sustained double-digit growth. Our future at Gartner remains bright. We provided credible value by helping our more than 15,000 enterprise clients with their most important initiatives.","Our business model allows us to drive strong double-digit growth in our key metrics including cash flow and we have an incredibly talented team across the business. With this foundation we're on track to achieve sustained double-digit growth in revenues, earnings and cash flow for years to come.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Craig to give you an in depth view of the quarter. Craig?","Craig Safian","Thank you Gene, and good morning everyone. Demand for our services remains robust around the world and in the first quarter we again delivered strong financial results across our three operating segments. As our 2019 outlook demonstrates, we continue to expect to deliver double-digit FX neutral revenue and EBITDA growth with strong free cash flow generation.","First quarter revenue was $970 million up 8% on a reported basis and 11% on an FX neutral basis. The product retirements we discussed last quarter impacted topline growth rate by about 1 full point. In addition, contribution margin was 64% up about 100 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA was $142 million down 2% year-over-year and up 0.5% FX neutral, consistent with our expectations as discussed last quarter.","Adjusted EPS was $0.58 and free cash flow in the quarter was $35 million. Our Research business had another excellent quarter. Research revenue grew 8% in the first quarter and 11% on an FX neutral basis. First quarter gross contribution margin was 70%. Total contract value was $3.1 billion at March 31, growth of 11.2% versus the prior year. We always report contract value growth in FX neutral terms and we have updated our historical metrics at 2019 FX rates in our earnings supplement.","I'll now review the details of our performance for both GTS and GBS. In the first quarter GTS contract value increased 14% versus the prior year, accelerating its growth rate both sequentially and year-over-year. GTS had contract value of $2.5 billion on March 31, representing just over 80% of our total contract value. Client retention for GTS remained strong at 82%, wallet retention for GTS was 105% for the quarter up 130 basis points year-over-year and the highest we've reported for GTS.","A combination of the client and wallet retention rates shows how our clients spend more with us each and every year. GTS new business grew 12% versus the first quarter of last year. New business is coming from a mix of new enterprises and growth in existing enterprises through sales of additional services and upgrades. We ended the first quarter with 12,821 GTS clients up 4% compared to Q1 2018. The average contract value for enterprise also continues to grow. It now stands at $198,000 for enterprise and GTS up 10% year-over-year.","As we've discussed at Investor Day, we continue to invest in GTS. The investment in headcount growth and improving productivity are driving the GTS acceleration you have seen over the course of 2018 and into the first quarter of 2019. For GTS the year-over-year net contract value increase or NCVI divided by the beginning period quarter bearing headcount was $115,000 per salesperson up 9% versus the first quarter of last year. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year productivity improvement.","Turning to global business sales, GBS contract value was $595 million at the end of the first quarter or about 20% of our total contract values. CV declined 3\/10th of a percent year-over-year but slightly increased sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2018. Many of our GBS metrics are affected by the discontinuation in 2018 of sales of the largest legacy products. As we described last quarter, the discontinuations were based on purposeful strategy that allows our sales teams to focus on GXL products going forward.","GXL products continue to gain share and are an important part of our strategy. Looking at total contract value from the GXL products we drove an FX neutral increase of 76% year-over-year from $180 million $208 million continuing the growth we saw in the back half of 2018. Similar to last quarter, on Page 11 we provided a bridge from fourth quarter 2018 to first quarter 2019 CV for GBS and the corresponding bridge from the prior year.","We sold $24 million of GXL products new business in Q1, $11 million more than we did in the prior year quarter. While Q1 is generally a seasonally lighter quarter for new business, GXL new business increased by 84% over the prior year quarter. We continue to make great progress with our GXL products across each of the functions GBS serves. More than half of the GXL new in the quarter came from newly launched products. GXL CV now makes up 35% of our total GBS contract value, up 15 percentage points from Q1 of last year.","While legacy GBS CV attrition is close to 30%, GXL attrition is around 20%, almost the GTS levels. On a blended basis that's about 27%. We will reduce attrition levels through improving client engagement. We are driving increased client engagement during expansion of our service teams and growing adoption of individualized content and service. For the standalone quarter we saw an improvement in the attrition rates for GBS. For contracts that were up for new in the first quarter, attrition improved by almost 200 basis points over the prior year quarter. Again, this is the result of the increased engagement we've discussed in all of our other retention programs starting to have an impact.","We continue to expect to achieve double-digit CV growth in GBS by the end of this year. As we described last quarter and at our Investor Day there are multiple paths to achieving double-digit CV growth by the end of 2019. The combination of improving attrition and corresponding retention rates and continued ramping of GXL new business are the metrics that will get us there.","In both GTS and GBS the first quarter is typically our seasonally lightest quarter for new business. And as we discussed last quarter the new business compares get easier as we move through the year. Our pipeline is building and the team has more experience every day.","In Conferences revenues increased by 13% year-over-year in Q1 to $52 million. FX neutral growth was 17%. First quarter gross contribution margin was 36% up by 120 basis points compared to the year ago quarter. We had 12 destination conferences in the first quarter. On a same conference FX neutral basis revenues were up 17% with a 6% increase in attendees. The first quarter is a seasonally small quarter, but the results were very strong.","First quarter Consulting revenues increased by 12% to $93 million. FX neutral growth was 16%. Consulting gross contribution margin was 31% in the first quarter. Labor based revenues were $79 million up 7% versus Q1 of last year or 11% on an FX neutral basis. Labor based global head count of 739 was up 6%. Utilization was 69%. Backlog ended the quarter at $108 million up 7% year-over-year on a FX neutral basis. We have updated our reporting of backlog to be FX neutral consistent with our practice for research contract value.","The updated historical data is in the earnings supplement. Our 2019 pipeline remained strong. The contract optimization services revenues were up over 60% versus the prior year quarter. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable.","SG&A increased 13% year-over-year in the first quarter or 17% on an FX neutral basis. We continue to grow sales capacity and the enabling infrastructure to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long-term. The enabling infrastructure includes investments in human resources functions like recruiting and in real estate to support our increased number of associates around the world.","As we discussed at Investor Day our largest dollar investments are in GTS where we have seen acceleration in contract value and productivity. We are investing to increase territories, to reduce open rolls, and to drive improvements to sales productivity. Our continuing investment in GCS, the Conferences sales team have been driving faster growth in that segment. We are investing to increase territories, to reduce open territories and to drive productivity.","GBS investments are also continuing and we expect to see acceleration this year and going forward. At the end of the first quarter we had 3,917 quota-bearing associates in research. This includes 3049 in GTS and 868 and GBS or growth of 11% and 21% respectively. We expect GBS headcount growth to moderate by the end of the year to approximately 14% to 16%.","Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $142 million down 2% on a reported basis and up 0.5% on an FX neutral basis. EBITDA was affected by about 5 percentage points or $6 million impact due to the product retirements. Taking that into consideration, the underlying FX neutral EBITDA growth was about 5% in the quarter. The first quarter is our smallest revenue quarter of the year which contrasts with the expense base that is less seasonal.","Depreciation was up about $3 million from last year as additional office space went into service. Amortization was flat sequentially after taking in expected step down in the fourth quarter as some of the acquisition intangibles reached their 18-month lives. Integration expenses were down year-over-year as we have moved passed the biggest part in the integration work.","Interest expense in the quarter was $25 million down from $35 million in the first quarter of 2018. The lower interest expense resulted from paying down roughly $700 million in debt over the past year. The Q1 adjusted tax rate which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 19.8% for the quarter. First quarter is typically a seasonally low quarter for the tax rate primarily due to equity related excess tax benefits. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 28.5% in the quarter.","We still expect our adjusted tax rate to be about 25.5% for the full year, but it may have more quarterly variance this year. As you can see in the disclosure in our 10-Q subsequent to the end of the quarter there was intercompany sale of some intellectual property that will have a material favorable impact on the second quarter adjusted tax rate. Our 2Q EPS guidance includes an adjusted tax rate of 13%. Our full year EPS guidance contemplated 2Q benefit.","Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $0.58 with upside relative to our expectations from below the line items including a lower than expected tax rate. In Q1 operating cash flow was $36 million compared to $3 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was driven by lower interest expense and lower payments for acquisition and integration and other non-recurring items.","Q1 2019 CapEx was $20 million and Q1 cash acquisition and integration payments and other nonrecurring items were approximately $20 million as well. This yields Q1 free cash flow of $35 million which is up 30% versus the prior year quarter. It\u2019s worth noting that Q1 of the prior year included free cash flow associated with our divested business. Excluding free cash flow from the divested businesses, our first quarter free cash flow would have been up over 100%. On a rolling four quarter basis our free cash flow conversion was 130% of adjusted net income excluding divested operations.","Turning to the balance sheet. We adopted the new lease accounting standard ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019. The impact of this new standard is the recognition on our balance sheet of right-of-use assets of $634 million and an operating lease liability of $836 million. $769 million of the operating lease liability is recorded as a long-term liability with the balance recorded as a current liability. There was no material impact on our income statement from the adoption of this standard.","Our March 31 debt balance was about $2.3 billion. Our debt remained 95% fixed rate. Adjusting EBITDA for the divestitures, our gross leverage ratio is now about 3.4 times EBITDA. We repurchased about $45 million of stock in the quarter. We will continue to be price sensitive and opportunistic as we return capital to shareholders. We have about $870 million remaining on our repurchase authorization.","Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We deploy our free cash flow and balance sheet flexibility by returning capital to our shareholders through our buyback programs and through strategic value enhancing M&A.","Turning to the outlook for 2019. Revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and EPS guidance all remain the same. As I mentioned when discussing the tax rates, we expected our tax rates for the second quarter will be around 13%. Our full-year guidance already reflected a lower 2Q rate. As you think about modeling the rest of the year, we expect mostly typical seasonality for the quarterly phasing. The EBITDA compare is particularly challenging in the third quarter. And lastly our guidance reflects FX rates as of April 30. The dollar strengthened over the course of 2018 and FX is causing roughly 2 point negative impact for our projected 2019 full year growth rates across revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flows.","The highlights of our full-year 2019 guidance are as follows; we expect revenues of approximately $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion. That is FX-neutral growth of 10% to 13%. In addition to the non-core businesses that we divested over the course of 2018, there were some additional products from the CEB acquisition that we viewed as non-core. We retired these, which is impacting our 2019 total revenue growth rate by about 75 basis points. This is almost $30 million about two thirds of which drops to EBITDA.","We expect adjusted EBITDA of $720 million to $765 million, FX neutral growth of 7% to 13%. Again, EBITDA growth this year is impacted by about 3 points from the product retirements we discussed previously. Excluding the product retirements, 2018 EBITDA would have been around $667 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 25.5% for 2019.","Please note, that if you are adding back from GAAP net income, the rate for the tax affect on the add backs is also about 25.5%. We expect 2019 adjusted EPS of between $3.82 and $4.19 per share, FX-neutral growth of approximately 7% to 15%. For 2019 we expect free cash flow of $455milion to $485 million. That is projected FX neutral growth of 11% to 19% versus our normalized 2018 free cash flow. All the details of our full-year guidance are included on our investor relations site.","Finally, for the second quarter we expect adjusted EPS of about $1.15 to $1.20 per share. We've had a great start to the year with strength across all of our operating segments and improvements in most of our key operating measures. Notably GTS contract value continued to accelerate and sales of our new GXL products and GBS continue to rise. Our Conferences and Consulting businesses both had strong quarters. Free cash flow was up versus last year and conversion was stable. 2019 is trending well so far. We are applying the Gartner Formula across the combined business to drive sustained long-term double-digit growth to revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Timothy McHugh","Yes, hello. Just wanted to ask on the, I guess, the productivity on the GBS side, I guess in your comment you said the momentum was still improving, but I guess, look at overall new business sales it feels like there is \u2013 I guess, it wasn\u2019t quite as strong as I would have expected, so is it, I guess you\u2019ve seen more of a drop off on the legacy side or help us think about the per person may be productivity of the new business sales on the GBS side as the new GXL products ramp up? Thank you.","Eugene Hall","Hey Tim, it\u2019s Gene. So, first our durable strategy we have as you know in GBS expanded sales force, get higher productivity as people learn, go up the learning curve, get higher retention because GXL products are high retaining products over time. We also want to expand on the legacy products, improve their retention as well over time which we expect to have.","In terms of Q1, Q1 is - in terms of new business is always our seasonally lightest quarter. I\u2019ll give you a flavor for why that happens. We do large share promotions for people between Q4 and Q1. The promotions are higher performers and see what happens is they close up their pipeline in Q4, knowing that they are going to have a new job in Q1, they are not building a pipeline for Q1.","Someone else then comes in who has a zero pipeline who is also a new person and anyhow has much more productivity between the combination of the starting zero pipeline and the fact that they are new to the company. And again they were placing it with a higher performance. So as a business our Q1 is always the lightest quarter for new business and across the business including in GTS. And there is really \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you one example of this other practices well invested kind of it's operational stuff that\u2019s driving it.","Craig Safian","The other thing I\u2019d add Tim, just really quickly is, when you look at productivity remember it is a \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of the new business productivity and the retention or attrition depending on which side of the equation you\u2019re looking at. As I mentioned in my remarks for the contracts that came up for renewal over the course of Q1 2019, we saw roughly 200 basis point improvement in retention and again as we\u2019ve talked about with full-year benefit of our retention programs and our real focus on that, we expect to continue to drive our retention improvements over the balance of the year as well.","Timothy McHugh","Maybe on that topic then, can you help us reconcile the client count metrics, I guess, the client retention metrics on the GBS side and I think a little bit also on the GTS side this quarter?","Eugene Hall","Yes, the one thing I would say about the client counts and this is why we tend to focus more on the Wallet retention numbers than the client retention numbers is, yes, we typically do have churn or higher churn amongst our smaller, lower spending clients. I think that is what happened with the GTS numbers for sure, but we continue to actually add a good number of new enterprises. The mix of new business from new enterprises was pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen historically and where actually the enterprises that we keep we\u2019re getting them to spend more and more with us each and every quarter.","On the GBS side, again, we\u2019re working through the transition of getting everyone up to speed on GXL. There\u2019s a modest amount of migration going on, but the real focus for the bulk of the sales force is really finding new buying centers within both existing GBS enterprises and new GBS enterprises and selling then GXL.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you very much. So I guess, you know in the Q I think you said that you saw double-digit growth across three quarters of the industry segments, I was just curious, you know, what are the areas where you are not seeing that and I guess is it just post double-digits or what are the headwinds there?","Eugene Hall","Manav, I think, what we\u2019ve said historically is really no different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past several or even dozen quarters is we saw double \u2013 in GTS we saw double-digit contract value growth, in every region, in every company size, and in virtually every industry. There are maybe one or two smaller industries that did not record double-digit growth, but again, it\u2019s no different than what we\u2019ve seen in previous quarters.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, got it. And then just on the GXL products, I mean what does the pipeline there look like in terms of additional GXLs or I guess version 2s or whatever you call it based on the client feedback and so forth you are getting?","Eugene Hall","Yes, so, it\u2019s Gene. The - our GXL pipeline is building really nicely, that\u2019s why you saw the kind of new business growth we saw in Q1, and as we go forward through the year, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019d expect that pipeline to continue to build.","Craig Safian","The other thing I\u2019d add Manav is, just like everything we do we\u2019re constantly iterating and evolving and improving the products set and so, even though we've launched the new GXL products we don\u2019t stand still and just hang, we\u2019re always looking to make sure we\u2019re consistently improving the product set.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, guys. Good morning, so I guess the first question, GTS sales productivity continues to move up and if I just survey the last 12 years annually it\u2019s never risen two years in a row. And so I guess, I wonder, and I'm not suggesting it won\u2019t continue to do well, but given that history, what are you doing different today or what conviction do you have that there\u2019s more room to go with sales productivity in the technology business?","Eugene Hall","Yes, hey, it\u2019s Gene, Gary. So, the - you know we\u2019re committed to continuous improvement and continuous innovation across our business, and over time we introduce innovations in all aspects of our sales processes. It ranges from what Craig said, which is, making sure the products are better every year, so obviously the products are better, they are easier to sell and on top of that, you get better retention. And then as you know we focus on tools, training, et cetera and processes and those things are continuously improving as well.","So, if you get down to it those are the things, the combination of constant improving products, constant improving sales tools, constant improving sales training, recruiting, also, we make sure, we are getting better every year at finding people that are better fit for the company as well. And so, it\u2019s a combination of all that stuff that\u2019s driving productivity, and so we are committed to continue to drive productivity up over time.","Gary Bisbee","And then just more of a macro question. When I look back over the history there have been a few times where you\u2019ve seen a little bit of softening in the CV growth when either macroeconomic or sort of end market challenges made it a little tougher to sell, there\u2019s been some slowdown in global growth and yet the business continues to fire incredibly well in the technology franchise. So do you don\u2019t think that\u2019s more just your execution or is there anything about demand in technology and how much, you know, the velocity of change in technology that\u2019s also contributing to the performance?","Eugene Hall","Yes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the velocity of change in technology. That would be sort of a more minor factor I think. You know, one of the things that we\u2019ve learned is that, at any given point in time some of our clients are doing well and some of our clients are in distress. And we have specific programs where we go and help clients that are distressed. They are not the same programs as clients that are in growth are doing well.","And again if I look across the \u2013 our client pace, we are we\u2019re in a hundred countries, we\u2019re in every industry with every size client, there\u2019s always some people in trouble. And I could give you specific countries where we did really, really well last year even though the economy was shrinking. And so the, you know, we have a real focus on making sure we can do well through the actual programs we run with our clients individually during well or not, and whether they are in a good macroeconomic situation or not.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thanks, good morning. This is Nick [indiscernible] on for Jeff. Just going back to the GBS enterprise count, I realize the wallet retention metric is more important and but just is there anything you're hearing about the product or pricing changes that maybe aren't resonating with some of the smaller legacy clients? Or is that really just kind of an outsized impact from the products being discontinued or an internal focus on some larger client opportunities if anything you can add there?","Eugene Hall","Yes, so just to build on Craig's point earlier, the client count is really driven by small companies and there are some more volatility with small companies, they are much more likely to get acquired, they are much more likely to go out of business. And so, in any given quarter, the kind of swings that happen are more driven by how many of those companies were not in existence or got acquired et cetera.","So it's - and that's true by the way of GTS as well as GBS in terms of the swing in client counts. If you think about like at the extreme, the S&P 500 companies that we serve, we're likely able to keep serving year after year, after year, after year is very high. Gene's pizza parlor that buys Gartner services, I may get quite a lot of business lot more frequently than S&P 500 companies. So that's really what's driving the client count.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's helpful and just a follow up on the CV trends and outlook over the rest of the year. Can you guys talk about how Q1 compared to your internal expectations and just given that sales force growth remains above the full-year target initiatives and you say that's easing comp, so are you kind of confident that Q1 should be the low watermark for the year?","Craig Safian","Hey, Nick, it's Craig. I think when we look at the Q1 performance across the board, whether we're talking revenue, profit, booking, CV, we kind of came in around where we expected to, again recognizing that Q1 is generally our latest quarter from a new business perspective, from a Conferences perspective, et cetera. So I would say we came in right around our expectations.","I think in terms of thinking about the balance of the year, as we discussed on our last earnings call and at Investor Day, particularly within GBS, that compares do get a little easier as we go through the year, just based on the phase out of legacy new business that we sold over the course of 2018.","And so the most - the bulk of that was sold in the first half of the year with a real step down as we fully launched and rolled out the new GXL products in the second half of the year. So that's the one place where we could argue or I would argue that the compare gets a little bit easier. I think on the rest of the business we performed really, really well last year and our expectation is that we continue to keep pace and\/or accelerate our performance across the rest of our businesses.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you, good morning. Using your framework last quarter showing the 8% CV growth given the same productivity rates, I tried to calculate it for LTM this quarter and assuming I have the inputs right it looks a little bit closer to 6%. And so, just I guess does that sound consistent with sort of what you're seeing and does that make you any less confident in the double-digit target, or is it just that you're expecting the comps to get easier, and so that's what makes you feel good about it?","Eugene Hall","Hey, good morning, Toni. So I think your math is right, so as you look at the extrapolation of new business productivity on an LTM basis, it did step down in the first quarter. We expect it to step back up over the next few quarters. Again as the sales force gets more seasoning, more tenured and gets really rolling from a productivity or new business productivity perspective, particularly around GXL, as you'll remember from that chart and discussion, there are two levers the attrition lever and the new business productivity lever.","And again as I mentioned, we're seeing nice improvement in - on the attrition side, and so again there were multiple paths to get to that double-digit contract value growth. We remain as confident coming out of Q1 as we were going into Q1 and again there are multiple ways to get there through various combinations of attrition improvement and new business productivity.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, terrific. And is there anything you could call out in terms of trends, in terms of tenure of sales people, basically are you keeping the GBS sales people that you want to be keeping, is there sort of any like any sort of retention trends in the sales people that would be helpful? Thanks.","Eugene Hall","Great question, because sales people's productivity goes up very rapidly the tenure, we want to retain people. As in GBS we have retention that is on par with GTS, and in fact our GBS retention is better this year than it was last year. So that will be another tailwind we'll have through the year is we'll have a richer mix of more tenured people.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. So we're a little over a third of the way through Q2 and I wanted to ask whether Q2 was actually going to be the inflection point for the GBS contract value growth. It would seem that, that would need to be the case if you're targeting double-digit by the end of the year, but I just wanted to confirm, that's the way you guys are expecting it or was it actually going to be Q3?","Craig Safian","Hey good morning, Bill. We don't give quarterly guidance on CV and\/or inflection points, but again the way I would describe it is, as I said earlier, the Q1 compare was the toughest, the Q2 compare is the next toughest, the Q3 compare is then the next toughest and then the Q4 compare would then the be the - I cringe using the word, but the easiest. So again, the way we're looking at it is really not on a quarter-by-quarter basis. As we've discussed, we are laying the foundation for future sustained and accelerated double-digit growth. We remain committed and we firmly believe we will get there by the end of the year.","Bill Warmington","And then as my follow-up question, the GXL new products are driving the 84% year-over-year, new business growth. I know you target a number of different multiples there HR, legal, accounting sales, in which vertical are you seeing the most traction and in which vertical are you seeing the least traction?","Eugene Hall","Bill, actually we're seeing good traction across the verticals. We showed a chart on Investor Day showed in six of the verticals, how we were doing and each one continues to accelerate. So I'd sort of say there's not one we see as the problem there, actually they're all doing really well in terms of the acceleration acceleration in GXL sales.","Bill Warmington","Got it, thank you for the help.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Silber","Thank you so much. I know you had mentioned that this is a relatively seasonally light quarter for new business, but if I could focus just on the GBS new business, are you seeing cross-selling to existing GTS customers, are these new customers for you, if you can give us a little bit of color on it, I'd appreciate it?","Eugene Hall","So it's a very good question, Jeff. So we do have cross selling, obviously we have a lot of relationships, you know 12,000 give or take GTS [indiscernible] we cross-sell to. We do cross sell. With GBS though the opportunity is so vast and we're still under-penetrated that it is, that's not the most important factor. So where it is helpful our sales force is doing that and we facilitate it. We're trying to facilitate it internally, but it's just the products are attractive and there is so much open market opportunity, that that's not the kind of most important factor.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, and I know your business has nothing to do with the stock market, but we saw kind of a wide swing in sentiment between what the market was expecting overall in the fourth quarter and what the market seems to be expecting in this last quarter. Did you see any change of tone in any of your customers because of that?","Eugene Hall","Are you thinking from a macroeconomic viewpoint, Jeff?","Jeffrey Silber","Yes, exactly.","Eugene Hall","Yes. So as Craig said in his remarks, I would characterize our - the selling environment the same as it's been all last year - Q1 was the same as it was in Q4 and those were the same as we saw all last year and in fact for some time actually I'd say. There is some - there are some countries that are not doing that great, but there's always some countries that are not doing that great. And I'd say for the big economies, they're kind of moving along at a - what I'd call a normal pace.","Jeffrey Silber","Okay, I appreciate the color. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi, in GBS, is this a matter of selling more of the new and less of the old and some better comps? I'm just trying to get a sense there. And then also are you selling new products to new clients or new products to old clients? I am just trying to get a sense of how that works at all?","Eugene Hall","So, on the first piece - on the second piece, if a client has legacy product and they're happy with it, we let them stay and be happy with it. We have very good margins on our products and we want to do that. And so, our real focus is not on upgrading, but on selling to new clients. It could be new clients in the same enterprise. So it could be a different division of the company, but it's really the folks are selling new clients. As Craig mentioned in his remarks, there are some upgrades, but that's not our primary focus.","Craig Safian","And Joe, it's Craig. The way to think about it, again, if you look at Page 11 in the earning supplement from this quarter or from last quarter when we reviewed the full year 2018, I'd say there are two primary levers here; one is continuing to focus on driving engagement, which translates into higher retention rates or lower attrition rates, and then two is the ramp of GXL new business more than outpacing the declines in legacy new business.","We are still selling some, what we call legacy new business in certain small areas where we have not launched the corresponding GXL C, that's kind of at a stable level now and we expect that to continue into the future until we replace them potentially with GXL products, but it's kind of all about the ramp of GXL new business combined with better retention.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. And then just as a followup, I understand the metrics associated with productivity and retention and the new products versus the old products. So that all makes sense on paper, but is there anything different that you could call out from a visibility standpoint in GBS that gives you added, I guess, confidence in the double digits? I'm sure the Street is curious as to why you're holding to it. So I'm just wondering if there's any difference around the visibility from a sales perspective or the process around it? Thanks.","Eugene Hall","So, it's a combination of things. So first, we've added significant capacity and we know that those sales people will gain tenure and will sell more. Secondly, we know that even if all the people that are still going through the learning curve and they'll sell more and our pipeline reflects that.","So, again, if you compare the pipeline for Q2 versus pipeline for Q1, it is significantly better, just kind of selling pipeline. And the second piece is like Craig said, which is, we know that GXL products have significantly higher retention and so as that mix continues, we sell more GXL, that mix continues to get richer with more GXL products and Craig mentioned, it's about 10 points higher retention or 10 points lower attrition then they are legacy products for the deals that renewed in Q1, and we expect that to continue.","So as we get more and more proportion of GXL products that have significantly higher retention and we get our sales - our larger sales force with more tenure as we extrapolate that out, we see that it looks - that's why we have confidence that we are on a good track.","Joseph Foresi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Peter Appert","Thank you. Good morning. So, Craig, just expanding a bit on your earlier comments in terms of the evolution in the GBS product, if you stop selling or you are de-emphasizing selling the legacy GBS product, does that imply then that the legacy GBS contract value continues to decline at the recent rate?","Craig Safian","Yes. it does, Peter. So that - yes, essentially what we've been tracking and trying to provide some visibility around is the mix. And so as I - I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, today we sit with 35% of our GBS contract value is in GXL and that's about 15 percentage points higher than it was Q1 of last year. And we expect soon over the next several quarters for GXL to be a bigger portion of the portfolio. That's a combination of accelerated GXL growth and continued declines in the legacy contract value.","Peter Appert","And does the legacy business then go to zero at some point?","Craig Safian","So, I don't think the legacy goes all the way to zero. There are still a handful of smaller functions that we serve with the legacy product set and it's a valuable product and the buyers or end users in our client set really, really like and value these products. Overtime there's a potential that we could launch GXL type product in those areas, but again that's not where the largest opportunity is.","The other thing I'd say is our strategy and Gene alluded to this earlier, is we - if clients are happy with the legacy and they want to keep renewing and keep paying us, we generally are fine with that as a strategy. And so, I think it's unlikely it goes all the way to zero. But again as I mentioned, it will continue to drift downward as we replace a lot of it with the new GXL new business.","Peter Appert","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks, good morning. I'd like to dive deeper into GBS sales productivity. The productivity of your GBS segment was negative 2,000 in net contract value increase per year ago sales headcount. I know 1Q is your lightest quarter for new business and you're retiring legacy products. But can you elaborate on why productivity is coming in negative given it takes 12 to 18 months for new sales hires to ramp and most of the GBS sales force was layered in a year ago?","Craig Safian","Hi. Good morning, George. Yes, it's actually, I mean, the primary factor that drove that decline is essentially the phase out of selling legacy new business. So, in Q1 of last year, the bulk of our sales force was still selling legacy leadership councils, we phased that out to the point where as of the beginning of Q3, we are only selling legacy leadership councils in the smaller businesses.","I just mentioned that we don't have a corresponding GXL product and we essentially lost that strong new business quarter in the rolling 4 quarter NCVI and replaced it with this first quarter where we had really strong GXL new business, but not enough to offset the decline, as you can see again on that Slide 11 of the decline in legacy new business. And so, you again as we look at it again, we're not playing the one quarter game here.","As we look at it over the long term, to get to the double-digit growth we talked about, we will absolutely have to have and will deliver very positive productivity for the full year again. You can do the math on what that would need to be. But again, I think it's just - it's a one quarter impact where we have the toughest compare, and as we progress through the year, as I mentioned the compares get easier, and we expect to see the GXL new business continue to ramp.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. Your GXL new business activity in the quarter was $24 million, but if you compare that to legacy product attrition that was $23 million. Can you discuss what factors over the next several quarters will help you to excel on new business trends outperform legacy attrition besides just using comps?","Eugene Hall","Yes, we expect new business to accelerate for all the reasons we've been talking on the call. So the fact that we had more sales people with more tenure and more used to selling GBS products and so we expect new business to accelerate.","And then secondly, we expect retention to get better or attrition to get better, less attrition for two reasons, one is that, we have - each quarter that goes on, we have more GXL products and GXL products as Craig mentioned have a higher retention rate, and secondly, for even the legacy products, we're putting in place retention programs to improve that retention as well. And so, it may never be as good as GXL, but we think we can still make substantial improvements in legacy product retention. So, it's the combination of new business accelerating and retention getting better as well.","George Tong","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Gene Hall, CEO for closing remarks.","Eugene Hall","Well, summarizing today's call, we delivered another robust performance in the first quarter of 2019 fueled by double-digit growth in each of our business segments, Research, Conferences, and Consulting. We continue to make significant global impact. We got more than 15,000 enterprise clients in more than 100 countries around the world with their mission critical priorities while providing great jobs to more than 15,000 counted associates globally. The Gartner Formula for sustained double-digit growth underpins our success our Research business and our business model allows us to write strong double-digit growth in all key metrics including cash flow.

Hall","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q1 2014 earnings call. Well 2014 is off to a good start. The continued successful execution of our proven strategy drove another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, earnings per share, and contract value.","As we discussed with you last quarter, we're deploying our capital strategically.","In the first quarter, we made a great strategic acquisition of Software Advice.","In addition, we repurchased almost $200 million of shares and expect to spend at least $400 million in 2014.","I'll share a few performance highlights from each of our businesses and talk briefly about our recent acquisition of Software Advice.","I'll will then turn the call over to Chris to share more details.","Research is our largest and most profitable segment. And our Research contract value grew 13%, FX neutral.","As has been the case for few years, we drove double-digit contract value growth in every region and client size and in almost every industry segment.","We expect contract value growth to accelerate in 2014, as we continue to execute on our growth strategy.","We also achieved strong retention rates. For the first quarter of 2014, enterprise client retention was at 84%, which is consistent with this time last year. And enterprise wallet retention was 104%, which is 1 point down from Q1 2013.","In Consulting, we drove a terrific performance for the quarter, led by our Contract Optimization business and strong sales bookings.","Consulting revenues increased 16% compared to Q1 2013, and backlog was up 14%, achieving its highest level since 2008.","Our Events business also delivered great performance. Our Q1 results were impacted by the shift of 4 events held in Q1 last year to the second quarter of this year.","On a same-events basis, growth was strong, with a revenue increase of 17%, year-over-year.","These results continue to illustrate the ongoing success of our strategy and the tremendous value we bring to our clients.","I'll now turn to our recent acquisition of Software Advice. As we discussed in the past, we continually track a range of potential acquisition candidates. We're extremely disciplined and selective around acquisitions and we will continue to be.","During Q1, we had a great strategic acquisition of Software Advice. Our traditional Research business is targeted at serving the 108,000 largest enterprises in the world.","And these enterprises makeup our global market opportunity of about $47 billion. But smaller enterprises also need help in dealing with technology challenges.","In fact, there are millions of small businesses in the U.S. alone. These represent a huge additional market that we have not previously addressed. Software Advice is a market leader in providing technology advice to enterprises that are smaller than those targeted by our traditional Research business.","To bring this to life, image you manage a small medical practice that needs to establish an electronic medical record system. Most likely, you had no full-time IT staff. You need to identify and assess potential suppliers, decide which one to go with and then transition to the new system.","Getting this right is critical to the success of your medical practice.","You need help with these important decisions. Software Advice addresses this market. They advise these smaller enterprises on what technologies are best for their specific situation, providing tremendous value to these clients.","For the past few years, Software Advice has been growing at a compound annual growth rate of more than 50% per year.","Last year, revenues were more than $15 million and the company is profitable. Software Advice is a great acquisition, it's a strong strategic [indiscernible] with Gartner, while expanding our market opportunity.","We continue to manage an active pipeline of acquisition candidates, and we will remain as diligent, disciplined and selective as we have been in the past. I said this before, and it remains just as true today. These are remarkable times for technology. Technology is transforming the world and driving change in every enterprise and every industry in the world on a scale of [indiscernible].","IT is transforming how we work and what we do, and Gartner is at the heart of it.","Every company whether for-profit, not-for-profit, large, medium or small, any government agency is a perfect -- is a potential client.","That gives us a vast untapped market opportunity for our services.","Gartner is the best source of help for enterprise leaders launching critical initiatives within the technology revolution.","Our systems often make the difference between success and failure for our clients, and we are relevant whether an institution is growing or facing economic challenges.","The successful execution of the right strategy drives our consistent performance. As some of you know, the fundamentals of our strategy are to create extraordinary research insight, develop strong sales capability, to deliver high-value differentiated offerings, to provide world-class service and to continually improve our operational effectiveness.","This time-tested strategy will allow us to maintain sustained double-digit growth into the future.","I'm confident in and excited about Gartner.","The Gartner brand is in a class by itself. Our products, services and people are superior to the competition, with a great business model. And we're relevant to virtually every enterprise in the world.","In summary, I'd like to leave you with 2 key takeaways from today's call.","First, the strong execution of our consistent winning strategy allowed us to, once again, deliver double-digit contract value growth. And with our share repurchase plan and the acquisition of Software Advice and our expanding market opportunity, we continue to be well-positioned to achieve sustained double-digit growth in our key metrics over the long-term.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Lafond","Thanks, Gene, and good morning. 2014 is off to a strong start with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue and earnings in the first quarter, continuing the trends of the last several years of consistently strong financial performance.","We continue to successfully execute our strategy and deliver on the financial objectives we have established and communicated.","Year-over-year, contract value growth accelerated to 13% as compared to 12% in Q4 of 2013, and retention rates ended at or near all-time highs.","Our Consulting business grew 16% on an FX-neutral basis for the first quarter on the strength of our Contract Optimization practice.","And our Events business increased by 17% year-over-year on a same-events and FX-neutral basis.","Demand for our services was robust across all of our primary business segments in the first quarter. Our strong top line performance and effective execution in capitalizing on the operating leverage in our business allowed us to, once again, expand our gross contribution margin.","Even as companies around the world face the uncertainties of the current macroeconomic environment, our business continues to grow at double-digit rates, quarter-after-quarter. This is because our products and services provide great value to the IT, supply chain and marketing professionals that we work with.","We're engaged on and relevant to the most important initiatives and projects. This is why we will continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance over the long-term.","I'll now provide a review of our 3 business segments for the first quarter, followed by a discussion of the Software Advice acquisition, and will end with the details for our revised outlook for the remainder of 2014 before taking your calls.","Let me begin with Research. Research revenue was up 12% on an as-reported basis in the first quarter and 13% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The contribution margin in this segment increased 135 basis points to 71% in the first quarter.","All of our key Research business metrics remained strong. Contract value grew to a record level of $1.408 billion, a growth rate of 11%, year-over-year on a reported basis and 13% on an FX-neutral basis.","As has been the case for the past several years, our growth in contract value in Q1 was extremely broad-based with every region and client size in almost every industry segment growing at double-digit rates.","New business, again, increased year-over-year, and the new business mix remains balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients.","While our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting, approximately 80% of our contract value growth came from volume with the balance from price increases.","We have consistently increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year on annual basis since 2005.","We implemented a price increase during the fourth quarter of 2013 and we expect to do so again this year.","Our volume growth reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients.","As a result, we ended the quarter with 9,094 client enterprises, up 7% over last year's first quarter. We also ended the quarter with 13,983 client organizations, up 6% over the last year's first quarter.","Our client retention rate at the organizational level ended the quarter at 82%. And we've maintained client retention of between 82% and 83% for the past 15 quarters.","In addition to retaining our Research clients at an impressive rate, the clients we retained continue to increase their spending with Gartner.","Organization level wallet retention was at 99%, an uptick from the prior quarter.","Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to the combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our larger clients.","As we've discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a 4-quarter-rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","Historically, we have disclosed our retention metrics at the organization level. Organization is our internally-defined metric that defines and identifies individual buying centers within the enterprises we sell to.","We have found that organizations can fluctuate due to both internal and external factors. This makes the metric less indicative of the true business performance and we have therefore, decided to disclose our retention metrics at the enterprise level going forward.","To give you some historical perspective on the enterprise retention metrics as we make this transition, we will provide 2 years of historical data on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Our client retention rate at the enterprise level ended the quarter at 84%, and we've maintained client retention at the enterprise level of roughly 84% for the past 2 years.","Wallet retention at the enterprise level ended at 104% in the first quarter, and it's been between 104% and 105% for the past 2 years.","In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in our Research segment. We grew our contract value by $158 million on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year, we continue to see strong demand from clients, and we continue to expect acceleration in contract value and revenue growth over the long-term.","We remain confident in our continued ability to deliver double-digit annual revenue growth in this business over the long-term.","Turning now to Events.","On a same-events basis, our Events segment continued the trend of extremely strong year-over-year revenue growth we've delivered for the past 4 years.","On a reported basis, the move of 4 events out of the first quarter affected the year-over-year comparison of our operating results.","Three of the events we moved out of Q1 were large mature events that were meaningful contributors to the segment's profit in 2013's first quarter.","And as I will discuss with you in a moment, we expect these 4 events to deliver solid growth and be meaningful contributors to our Q2 results.","In the first quarter, Events revenue decreased 40% year-over-year on an as-reported basis, and declined 41% on an FX-neutral basis as a result of the move of these 4 events.","During the first quarter, we held 8 events with 3,394 attendees compared to 12 events with 5,788 attendees in the first quarter of 2013.","On a same-events basis, Events revenue was up 17%, year-over-year in the first quarter and attendee revenue increased 27%, and exhibitor revenue increased 13% for the quarter, also on a same-events basis.","The growth contribution margin of 21% for Q1 decreased roughly 9 percentage points from the first quarter a year ago, again reflecting the move of 4 mature events out of Q1 into Q2.","We expect our full year contribution margin to be in line with our original expectations, as reflected in the annual guidance we issued in February.","We've already held 3 of the 4 events that moved out of the first quarter in April. These 3 events performed extremely well with a revenue growth of almost 40%.","As a result, we believe our Events business remains well-positioned to deliver another strong year in 2014.","Moving on to Consulting. Revenues in Consulting increased 16% on both a reported and FX-neutral basis in the first quarter.","Our Contract Optimization business was the primary driver of the strength in Consulting, as certain deals occurred earlier in the year than we anticipated.","Our core Consulting business was also solid with 5% revenue growth from the first quarter.","Billable headcount of 512 was down 3% from the first quarter of 2013. First quarter utilization was 64%, and revenue for billable headcount ended the quarter at $421,000 per consultant.","We are seeing steady demand for our Consulting services. Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $111 million. This represents a 14% growth year-over-year, and a 5% growth from the fourth quarter of 2013.","And represents a healthy 4 months of backlog, which is our target for this business.","Backlog is now at the highest level we've reported since 2008.","With the current backlog and visibility we have into the pipeline, the Consulting business is positioned to deliver solid results in 2014.","Moving down the income statement, SG&A increased by $24 million year-over-year during the first quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force.","As of March 31, we had 1,698 quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 237 sales associates from a year ago.","We continue to tightly control G&A costs across the entire company. We believe this expense item will provide us with a source of operating leverage in the future. SG&A will continue to decline as a percent of revenue, as it did in Q1, as compared to the first quarter of 2013.","Moving on to earnings. We delivered another quarter of solid earnings growth.","Normalized EBITDA was $85 million in the first quarter, up 13% year-over-year. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.40, up 5% year-over-year.","Our Q1 2014 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes $0.04 of amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions, including Software Advice and prior deals.","Excluding acquisition-related charges, our normalized EPS grew 13% to $0.44 in the first quarter.","Turning to cash. First quarter operating cash flow decreased by $3 million to $16 million versus the first quarter of 2013, largely due to higher year-end bonus and commission payments made this year.","The first quarter is the seasonally lightest of the year for operating cash flow and we still fully expect to achieve the guidance we set for the full year.","During the first quarter, we utilized our cash to return capital to our shareholders through our newly established share repurchase authorization.","During the first quarter, we repurchased over 2.7 million shares, and we used approximately $196 million of cash for the share repurchases.","We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position, despite the more aggressive pace of share repurchase and the Software Advice acquisition.","As of March 31, we had net debt of $72 million.","Our credit facility runs through March 2018, and at this time, provides us with about $389 million of remaining borrowing capacity.","We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives to drive increased shareholder value.","We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash, such as the Software Advice acquisition we completed in the first quarter and which I'll discuss further in just a moment.","We also continue to believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital. Absent other significant opportunities to deploy cash, we still expect to repurchase at least 400 million of our own shares this year.","Let me now spend a few minutes discussing our recent acquisition of Software Advice, which I'd like to cover from 3 perspectives: the impact on cash flow and our balance sheet; the impact to operating results; and lastly, the impact to GAAP earnings per share.","First, with respect to the cash flow statement and balance sheet. As you will see in our 10-Q, we paid $103 million at closing to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Software Advice.","We also funded $13.5 million of escrow, which is -- which we negotiated as protection against future potential losses.","The escrow amount is considered restricted cash and recorded in other assets on our balance sheet.","From an operating perspective, the impact of Software Advice on our Q1 operating results is not material since we closed on March 7.","For the full year, Software Advice will add modestly to our Research segment.","As a result, we've raised our guidance for the Research revenue by $20 million at both the low-end and high-end of our previous range to reflect the impact of integrating Software Advice into our operations.","We now expect Research revenue to be between $1.435 billion and $1.455 billion.","I would like to note that contracts with clients of Software Advice products will not be included our contract value figures.","Currently, Software Advice services are delivered on a transactional basis versus an annual subscription basis, as with Gartner's Research services.","There are also a number of items that will impact GAAP earnings per share for both the quarter and the full year.","First, as you would expect, we incurred transaction fees in connection with the acquisition. We also had put in place retention bonuses for much of the Software Advice team. The combination of these 2 items will impact 2014 by about $3 million.","Second, as with all of our prior acquisitions, there is a noncash intangible amortization which will run through the P&L for several years post acquisition.","In 2014, we expect these amounts to be roughly $4 million.","And then lastly, there are amounts related to the acquisition that are being held back until certain employment conditions are met.","These amounts will be accrued ratably as expense over the service periods of the relevant employees.","We anticipate that just under $17 million will accrue to the 2014 P&L. If the employment conditions are not met, the expenses that have been previously accrued will be reversed.","In total, we expect approximately $24 million of acquisition and integration charges in 2014 related to the Software Advice transaction.","Additionally, there will be roughly $3.5 million of intangible amortization related to our past deals, which was included in all of our previous guidance.","These amounts will be in included primarily on 2 lines on the face of the P&L.","Intangible amortization will flow through the amortization line, while everything else will appear on the acquisition and integration charges line.","This is consistent with how we've handled acquisitions in the past and how we will handle any future transactions.","Lastly, I'd like to note that these charges are excluded from our normalized EBITDA calculation, and our guidance for normalized EBITDA remains unchanged.","We do not expect a material impact on normalized EBITDA from Software Advice in 2014, as we will make certain investments to allow this business to scale, thus ensuring strong growth into the future.","However, we expect a more meaningful contribution to Gartner's normalized EBITDA in future years.","We will also now be providing guidance for both GAAP EPS and normalized EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges, to help you better understand our true operating results.","Our normalized EPS guidance of $2.15 to $2.32 per share is slightly ahead of the EPS guidance we gave you in February, as we have not broken out acquisition-related expenses stemming from past acquisitions, as the impact was nominal at only $0.02 to $0.03 per share.","However, we now expect GAAP EPS to be between $1.96 and $2.13 per share, reflecting the acquisition-related charges I just detailed from Software Advice and from prior transactions. For further information you can review our most recent 10-Q, which contains the above information as well as additional details related to the acquisition.","The other minor change to our guidance relates to our share count and interest expense.","Because we were able to repurchase almost $200 million worth of shares in Q1, we can now revise down our full year weighted average share count assumptions to be between 91.5 million and 92 million shares.","We still expect that on December 31, 2014, we will have less than 90 million shares outstanding.","We are also increasing our interest expense assumption modestly to $10.5 million, primarily to reflect borrowing to fund the Software Advice acquisition.","All other guidance we detailed in February remains unchanged.","As we discussed with you on our Q4 earnings call and at our recent Investor Day, to provide additional visibility and transparency, we're going to provide quarterly EPS guidance for the upcoming quarters.","We expect EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges, to be between $0.50 -- sorry, between $0.56 and $0.60 per share in the second quarter of 2014.","Acquisition and integration charges are expected to be approximately $0.06 in Q2.","Based on everything we see today, we're comfortable with the midpoint of this EPS guidance range.","So to summarize and before taking your questions, we delivered solid results for the seasonally light first quarter of 2014. Demand for our services is strong, and as a result, we generated double-digit revenue growth. And our key business metrics remained strong in the first quarter.","Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with the positive operating leverage inherent in our businesses, delivered solid earnings and cash flow growth for Q1.","As always, we are actively exploring strategic alternatives for deploying our cash.","We will continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase program going forward.","Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in the first quarter of 2014, we established a solid foundation for delivering another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for the full year.","We're well positioned for double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing returns to our shareholders over the long term.","Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Gene, given how strong the start was for the year, both in terms of the Research revenue and the contract value, I guess I'm a little surprised that you were not more optimistic in terms of the guidance. What's driving your thinking on that?","Christopher J. Lafond","Peter, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're only 3 months into the year. And if you look at our performance, we feel very confident with what we're seeing across our business. I would note a couple of things. We had expected to see acceleration in our Research business. And so we're tracking right where we had hoped at this point in the year.","Our Events business is tracking, probably, marginally better than we thought, but it's still early in the year and a lot of our big events have not happened. Q1 is obviously a light Events quarter.","And in Consulting, our business was primarily driven by Contract Optimization. As we've talked about many times, that business tends to be somewhat lumpy quarter-to-quarter.","So we still expect that business to remain in that $30 million to $40 million range that we talked about for the full year.","So as we sit here today, we still feel very comfortable with the guidance we gave and that's why the guidance is what it is at this point in the year.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And Chris, does the sales -- is the plan to accelerate sales force hiring as the year progresses? Or is the first quarter a good indication of how you think the full year goes?","Eugene A. Hall","So Peter, it's Gene. So the plan for sales force hiring is basically as to grow it in the 15% to 20% range for the year. We were in that range in Q1, we expect to be in that same range for the full year.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. So no indication whether you're going to be at the high or low end of the range?","Eugene A. Hall","No.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then one last thing. On the Software Advice acquisition, could you talk about how you see this product being leveraged by Gartner? I would assume your sales organization really doesn't have the capability to sell this product since it is to smaller organizations. So how do you get leverage from this and can -- while you're talking about that can you also just sort of comment on how you thought about the purchase price? Because it seems like a pretty rich valuation for a small business.","Eugene A. Hall","So Peter, in terms of the business, what it does is, as I mentioned on my comments, Gartner has targeted the 108,000 largest enterprises in the world. And our business model isn't optimized to serve business of small events. It's optimized to serve those 108,000. In the U.S. alone, there are millions of small businesses. They have the same kind of IT problems that large businesses do as well. And we have seen that as being a great market opportunity. It fits squarely with what we naturally do.","Software Advice has the business model that's designed to address that. And in particular, what they do is they look at the specific needs of each segment in that -- in these markets.","So I used an example of electronic medical records. Electronic medical records actually for small medical practices is not one market. There is different electronic medical record systems depending on which medical specialty you are.","And so what they drove [ph] is a very good approach for determining what are the options for each of these kinds of markets that small companies are in, which tend to be very specific to the nature of that small company, even though there is -- there could be in any one segment, tens of thousands or even millions of small companies that work [ph] in that segment. In terms of the other part of the question, Chris will answer.","Christopher J. Lafond","Peter, with regard to valuation, as you know, we have been extremely selective and thoughtful with regard to executing acquisitions over the years. Software Advice is no different. Valuation has always been extremely important to us in terms of when we choose to do deals. So we are very thoughtful about doing things at the right valuation. And that will drive shareholder value. And again, we believe that's the case here. If you look at the valuation that we paid, we feel it's absolutely in line with what we're seeing in the marketplace today for similar assets and it's an extremely reasonable valuation. And we are very happy with the acquisition.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Anj Singh dialing in for Hamzah. My first question is just on SG&A. We see that it's up quite a bit year-over-year. Can you tell us what's driving that? And perhaps, how the sales and marketing portions are trending versus the G&A?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, just on SG&A, that the increases I talked about a few minutes ago, is driven by the continued increase in our sales force. Our sales headcount is up 16% year-over-year. G&A is actually down as a percent of revenue. And so we continue to really tightly manage G&A cost. And so G&A continues to come down as a percent of revenue. So the driver of our SG&A cost is our continued investment in the sales force.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And one follow up, can you give us a sense of how your business is doing in Europe? And how that environment may have changed from last quarter, if at all?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. It's Gene. So the -- our business in Europe is doing great. As I mentioned before, we have seen double-digit growth in all of our geographic regions, including Europe.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, I was going ask, the contribution margin for Research, I think you've talked a little bit about once you start approaching 70%, then it will be tougher to continue to drive that upward, but it looked like it was up pretty significantly still this quarter. Is there something underlying that or -- that made this quarter unusual in terms of the upside? Or perhaps, are you finding ways to -- that makes you think you can extend beyond that previous kind of hurdle rate you had before?","Christopher J. Lafond","Tim, it's Chris. No we still believe 70% is the right number on a full year basis. There is some seasonality to our margin in that segment. In particular, fourth quarter tends to be lowest, first quarter tends to be highest. And that's because, in the fourth quarter, our analysts are traveling to symposiums, doing a lot of client meetings as we close up the year to close deals.","So we would expect it to be a little higher to begin the year, little lower at the end of the year, and still be right around that 70% number. So we don't have any thought today that 70% is still not the right place to be for that segment.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then on Software Advice, the margins, I understand you said you're, I guess, investing and that's accelerating, what would the -- is that just adding salespeople ahead of growth? And just to make sure I understood the comments, did you expect you can get similar margins to the core business? Or I guess how would you compare it? And how long will it take you to get there?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, so just a couple of things on that. The investments we're making are kind of across the business. So as you would imagine, in a smaller company like Software Advice, as much as we like the business and it's a very well-run business, in order to scale it, we believe we have to make investments in their technology platforms, in their operations of the business. So there's number of places we're going to make some investments to make sure that we can scale that business over the long term and grow it geographically as well.","In addition, from a margin perspective, we fully expect that this will be a nice positive contributor to our business. And over the long term, it's going to be a really nice margin enhancement to the overall company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then one last numbers one, you mentioned the Events, you had 40% growth on I think it was the Events that moved out of the first quarter into the second. Was that just the same events that -- the revenue growth for those 3 events?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, so we had 4 events moved, 3 of them have already been held in the month of April. Those 3 events, as I mentioned, were very large, relatively large mature events, so they had a pretty significant impact in the Q1 2013 results. And since we've held them now, we saw similar great performance. In fact, as I said, those same 3 events, just those 3 were up about 40%. So from a same-events perspective, really strong performance on the 3 we've held.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you explain the Software Advice revenue model a little more. I guess, I understand you said it's transactional and not subscription-based, but is that something you'll look to change? And within that transactional, how recurring is that, how stable and predictable? So is this different from the core business in Research?","Eugene A. Hall","Gary, its Gene. So it is different in the core business. Typically -- again, you go back to my small medical practice. They typically buy things -- they typically have -- they tend to buy their software and their IT technology from the outside as opposed to kind of building it themselves. And in tends to be episodic. So you don't -- they don't buy a new electronic medical record kind of every month, every quarter, even every year.","And so what happens is that the way our economics work is, it's more related to when they have specific transactions as opposed to they pay an upfront fee for a year of service. So when they need to do a deal, that's kind of when we get paid as part of that. And the -- and so it's very -- it's not a kind -- a 1-year contract, it's related more to the -- it's transactional.","And on the other side of it, though, is unlike our larger -- our traditional business, there are many millions of these companies at any given point in time, and so we think that it's likely to -- that will smooth out a lot of the individual transactions as opposed to a business that doesn't have that kind of nature to it.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then, how do they go to market or sell or find clients and how do we think about -- you said a 50% revenue CAGR, I guess, $20 million for the year, that's only 10 months, shows that's pretty good growth versus that $15 million you said for last year that I figured. Any sense how we think about the impact on the growth and maybe how penetrated the opportunity is?","Eugene A. Hall","So the market opportunity is enormous. They have a very tiny portion of the market. And they are almost wholly in the U.S. today, and they only have a tiny portion of the U.S. market. So the opportunity for growth is huge there. And we think it can have -- be able grow at a higher rate than our traditional business for a long period of time.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. Do we get an update on the sales productivity? It -- I may calculate it slightly differently than you do, but it's looks like it fell again in Q1. I know you were talking about at the Investor Day flat to maybe improving this year. And as a second part of that, any change in those 2 positive metrics you mentioned a quarter ago, the retention of sales force overall improving and the cohort of new people from last year doing somewhat better versus prior cohort?","Christopher J. Lafond","Great, Gary. It's Chris. Yes, sales productivity is essentially flat from last year when you look at it in the first quarter. However, if you look at just a standalone quarter, Q1 this year is better than last year's Q1.","So we are certainly seeing -- when you look at just individual standalone quarters, we're seeing some nice improvement there.","And it's flat to Q4. So -- I'm sorry, flat to Q4, sorry, not to Q1 of last year, my apologies, I was talking about sequential.","And -- but standalone, if you look at Q1 versus Q1, we saw an increase.","So where we are today, it's effectively what we said in our guidance, which was we did not expect in our guidance to see any dramatic increase in sales productivity, it would remain flattish and that's kind of roughly where we are.","So we're continuing to do lots of things and expect that what we're seeing in Q1 hopefully will continue to show benefit for the rest of the year, and start to see that increase from here. And our turnover has had steady improvement. Sales turnover has had steady improvement on [ph].","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask if you're seeing a change for the better in client's willingness to spend on new products? And if so, what's behind that?","Christopher J. Lafond","Bill, it's Chris. A couple of things I would say there. If you look at average spend per organization, it continues to increase. It's up just over $100,000, which continues to improve. I think that's up almost 7% from the first quarter of last year and up a couple of percentage points from the fourth quarter. So as we talk about all the time, we're seeing that mix coming from -- about 20% of that increase is really due to pricing and the other 80% is real volume. So we're continuing to penetrate the clients, continuing to sell more into those clients. So that trend has been the trend we've been on for quite sometime and it is continuing.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm trying to parse whether -- does the cyclical from the secular, whether if some of it's coming from an improving economy, or if some of it's coming from sort of an inflection point in terms of the client base seeing an increase in value or having an increase in need, giving a pickup in the velocity of the change in technology?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, it's not the economic environment that has caused any change. And I'd sort of say if look at what's going on, the economic environment is not giving us any additional demand. The 2 things that are driving our increasing demand is -- one is, all the initiatives we have on sales productivity. And the second one is, what I talked about in our remarks, which is just what's going on the technology world general where it's affecting every business, every industry. And it's becoming more pervasive all the time. And so we have this underlying change that's going on in every enterprise, where technology is becoming more important. So they see the need for it and we're the best there is to do it. Then we couple that with our focus on making sure salespeople are as productive as they can be.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So one housekeeping question, the share count exiting Q1, fully diluted?","Christopher J. Lafond","Fully diluted share count exiting Q1, just give me a second. For the quarter, we had 93,209,000, that's the average for the quarter. We are actually -- let me just give you the exact number. It's down a couple of million, probably, below that. But we'll get you the exact -- we'll get an exact number for that.","Eugene A. Hall","We'll go to the next question and circle back with that share count number.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Ryan Ripp - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Ryan filling in for Manav. Just to follow-up on Gary's question, I just want to make sure I wrote that down right on the sales productivity metrics. So essentially flat from fourth quarter, and then this Q1 was better than last year on a standalone basis, did I hear that right?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, that's correct.","Ryan Ripp - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, turning to Software Advice, I know you said the market opportunity is enormous. Is there any way to quantify that kind of similar to how you breakout the core research model just in terms of total size or number of enterprises or anything along those lines?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, it's Gene. We have not done that yet.","Ryan Ripp - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And that's -- we should think of them as wholly U.S. so far, and then there's the plan to kind of bring them internationally as kind of in line with your -- with the current business model?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes.","Christopher J. Lafond","So again, in the U.S. alone, they have tiny penetration. And they are overwhelmingly U.S. And because we are global company, one of the ways we'd expect to leverage them is in fact to build their business globally. What they do is just as relevant everywhere in the world.","Ryan Ripp - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned, you're seeing similar valuations for deals of this nature. So if we -- going forward, is this kind of the valuation we should expect on deals for this year?","Christopher J. Lafond","Well, from a valuation perspective, as I talked about, we are very thoughtful about all of the deals we do, depending on the company, depending on the marketplace and depending on the growth rate of the business. So there's a whole bunch of different factors that are going to weigh in to valuation on individual transactions. So I wouldn't necessarily say one transaction is the market. We believe this transaction was done at a very -- a very good valuation, and we'll look at each one independently.","Ryan Ripp - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And just one more, if I could, on the buybacks. Is there anything that moves that $400 million for the year higher, whether it be lack of M&A or anything that you see that would move that number up?","Christopher J. Lafond","We will continue to look, as we always do, at all uses of cash. As we talked about at the beginning of this year, we will feel very strong with our current cash position, the strength in our business and the continued growth in our business, as well as our balance sheet, that at least $400 million makes sense. And we'll look at that as we go through the rest of the year. And I just wanted to come back and circle back on the question that, the basic shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were 90.2 million, but we will clarify the weighted shares outstanding as of the end of the quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","In prior quarters, you called out some trends in your government business, I was wondering if we'd do that for this quarter.","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. So our public sector business overall grew at high-single-digit rates. In terms of the U.S. federal government, there is really no change in the situation we talked about for the past few quarters.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And how about governments abroad?","Eugene A. Hall","Again, the same thing, I think if you looked at the public sector overall, it's pretty much what you see. There is no change.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. I just wanted to circle back to the Software Advice acquisition, I'm not sure if you've answered this question about your go-to-market strategy. Is this going to be sold under a separate sales force? Are you going to keep the name, are you going to change the name? Any color there will be great.","Eugene A. Hall","So, they have a different sales force. It's a different distribution channel. And in terms of the name, we're deciding how we're going to handle branding. For now, we're -- for now, we have retained Software Advice but we'll figure in the future -- we're still determining what we'll do in the future.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And then just one on one that you had mentioned that the price you paid was reasonable based on other deals. Are you looking at any revenue multiple, a price-per-employee multiple? I'm just curious what metrics you used to make that statement.","Christopher J. Lafond","When we look at transactions, depending on the transaction, we look at multiple -- we look at a variety of different valuation multiples. We do look at revenue, we do look at earnings, we do look at cash flow, we look at a variety of them, and it's growth rate and other things. So we're looking at all of those when we look at valuation and feel very comfortable that this is a very good valuation for our business and for shareholders.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First on the Software Advice acquisition and, I guess, more on the small business, medium-sized business market opportunity. Should we view this as kind of a platform acquisition that you use to attack that opportunity? Or should we view it more as the first of several potential acquisitions as you increase more focus on that part of the market?","Eugene A. Hall","So Jeff, it's Gene. So Software Advice we think is the market leader in -- in doing the kind of work we do with small businesses, and so we see that as a core acquisition.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then on Consulting, I get that Contract Optimization is lumpy and that drove a lot of the upside in the quarter, but the backlog was also strong. Can you talk about where the demand for -- what types of services you have the strongest demand for, any geographies? Anything along those lines in terms of what's the driving the strength in the backlog?","Christopher J. Lafond","It's been -- if you look at the strength in the backlog, it was pretty balanced, actually geographically. So we have really good strength around the world.","And so from that perspective, very balanced. As you know, we're very focused on the kinds of activities that we do at our core Consulting and benchmark businesses. And we saw real strength across the portfolio. So I wouldn't say there's any specific place that drove that. It was just a very nicely balanced performance across the Consulting business.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, I think you talked about the Research contract value outlook a little bit differently in terms of the language that you used this quarter versus last quarter. I think, Gene said expect to accelerate in 2014? Just to be clear, are we still talking about -- you expect it to be in the 13% to 14% range for 2014? Or are you saying you expect it to accelerate further from here, so maybe the range is now 14% to 15% or is it just 14% or how should I interpret that?","Eugene A. Hall","Now as we sit here today, I think we're still reflecting what we talked about on the last call, which is we still expect to be in the 13% to 14% range. We've accelerated the 13% and we still believe that we have the opportunity to get to that 14% range this year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess I'm going to try to focus in on what I had a question on, was sort of what changed and drove the uptick in the quarter? Consulting seems to be more discretionary, it seems like that picked up. It's sounds like Europe got a little bit better and there's really no change on the government business. So was this more execution or, to the prior question, is this economically driven and only the economy getting better as this changes in IT? I'm just trying to get a feel for sort of what you would point to?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, again it's not the economy getting better, it's basically I think the fact that technology is becoming more important so people need help with that, technology changes. And it's also execution. Let me just comment on Consulting, specifically. As many of you know, our strategy in Consulting has been to build a cadre of managing partners and we've been working on that. And I think one of the things that has really that -- as we analyze the results for Q1, we have strong bookings there. It's really being driven by the strategy of having managing partners to drive that business. And so that's as an example of the kind of -- how our operational changes are really driving the improvement.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, on the contract value uptick to maybe the 13%, 14% range, that kind of holding or improving in the back half of the year, is that still based on sales force productivity, and some of the new hires coming on, as we talked about at the Analyst Day?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, its really going to change from Analyst Day, which is we're assuming we have flat sales productivity. It doesn't improve. And if you just look at with flat sales productivity, if we don't have improving sales productivity, we still get an acceleration in our contract value growth rate.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got it. And just can I assume that sales productivity is still higher for some of the -- I think you talked about some of the new hires, the sales force productivity was -- had been ahead of what you were expecting?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes. So as we have -- we've been very focused on improving the performance of new hires. And in fact -- and we track it very closely, and the performance of new hires is improving.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then, the last question for me just on the pricing front. Was it easier to get prices this year than in prior years? Or is it just the same sort of environment that you've seen before?","Eugene A. Hall","I would say the same. We -- as we've talked about repeatedly, we put that 3% to 6% in place. We've been able to do that every year. I wouldn\u2019t say there's any dramatic difference this year versus last year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question is, do you have any updated thoughts on your long-term leverage target? Is there still a willingness to increase leverage to 3x or so? Or has does that changed with the business environment? And if it hasn't changed, any timeframe around how you're thinking about that given that it's going to need help [ph] for a while?","Christopher J. Lafond","Andre, its Chris. As we've talked about many times, we feel very comfortable that this company could easily handle, on an ongoing basis, 2x to 3x debt-to-EBITDA on an ongoing basis. And could handle above that for certain transactions that make sense, because we know that with our cash-flow-generating ability they'll come down pretty quickly. So no change in terms of how we think about the long-term leverage that we can handle and that we would like to get to.","As we talked about at Investor Day, the acceleration in share repurchase, as well as the acquisition pipeline we feel we have, will help get us there. And we don't have a specific timeframe, but we're going to continue to work through the year and execute as we have in Q1. And we will be able to provide updates as we go through the year.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Then on the productivity front, I know you've called out some areas, in particular, in the past, where you've had some challenges, like Europe. Any update, in particular, on progress in the areas that you've called out in the past? Have you seen those progress or is it just more of the same given the economy hasn't changed much?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, I'd say -- I mean, I talked about the public sector earlier, in essence we've seen no change. I'd say, in other things we're seeing modest improvement as we focus operationally.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jerry Herman from Stifel.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","First question about the sales force. Gene, you referenced better retention in the sales force. Could you give some metrics on that in terms of how much it has in fact improved? And also a part of that question, can you talk -- you referenced your onboarding process or getting the newer staff people to master it [ph] more quickly? Can you talk about their retention rate from most cohorts?","Eugene A. Hall","So we've been very focused on hiring people that are a good fit with Gartner, because we know if we have -- they'll be more successful, they'll stay longer, it's a win-win for everybody. And our retention has been improving modestly over the last 2 to 3 years. So it isn't just -- it's part of the trend and its every year it's gotten a little bit better. We're staying on that same trend with getting a little bit better each year. And so the -- it's an important metric. And I think it's getting better because we're -- we keep -- we, as an institution, keep getting better if we hire people that are really good fit with our kind of environment.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then just a question about Software Advice. I know there has been a lot of it today for small business, but it seems like that business model would inherently have lower margins than your core Research product? And in fact, it almost seems like it better resembles a Consulting model, is -- am I missing something there? Or should we -- does it in fact look more like a Consulting model?","Eugene A. Hall","So it does not look like a Consulting model. We don't think about it as a Consulting model at all. And we think, over the long-term, it will have very attractive margins.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","As high as research?","Christopher J. Lafond","So Jerry, its Chris. When you look at that business, obviously, we're making some investments now and we will see. As that business scales, we will be able to give you more insight as we get farther along that path, but we certainly do not expect it to be a Consulting model. We expect it to be more like a Research business. And we'll be able to come back to you as we move ahead here.","Operator","And your next question is a follow-up from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one quick one on the -- Chris, your comments around the financials for this acquisition. I -- you lost me on a part of it. Can you just repeat what you said about there was some performance bonus or something that you're accruing? But if some numbers weren't hit -- what I missed was what the magnitude of that was, #1. And #2, what line on the P&L you said that would flow through?","Christopher J. Lafond","Sure, let me just go back and share with you what I talked about there. So when you look at what we did, there were some amounts that we have held back until certain employment conditions are met. And the amounts that -- those amounts will be accrued ratably and expensed over the service period of those employees. So over a couple of year period, which is the appropriate accounting for this particular transaction. And we anticipate that just under $17 million will accrue to the 2014 P&L for that amount. And then there'll be some in 2015 as well, a little bit higher, but -- and a little bit into 2016, just because of the timing of the transaction. So -- and if those conditions are not met, we wont pay those out. And we'll reverse those charges, but we're going to be accruing them and then the cash will go out the door when they hit those particular -- and it will all be in the line called acquisition and integration charges. So you'll see it in that line item.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So help me understand that a little more. I mean it sounds to me like it's compensation rather than something that would be excluded from the normalized -- your adjusted earnings and EBITDA?","Christopher J. Lafond","No, actually this just happens to be the accounting treatment for the transaction. So it's all part of the purchase price. How we decided to protect ourselves and to protect against either not achieving the kind of results we thought we'd achieve, we held these amounts back. And from an accounting perspective, it's treated this way. It is not compensation expense. It's part of the deal and the transaction. However, from an accounting perspective -- from an accounting perspective, we treat it as if it was compensation in the P&L, however that's not what it is in terms of the deal itself.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So -- but you treat it as if it's comp, but it's in the line you're excluding. Is that -- those -- that last statement doesn't make sense to me.","Christopher J. Lafond","It is in the acquisition and integration line because it is a deal cost. From an accounting perspective, we are required to treat it the way we're treating it and ratably expense it over the period of performance, which is over a 2-year period.","Operator","And your next question is a follow-up from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Sorry, just to follow-up on that. So just to clarify, this going to be a cost in addition to the $102 million that I see on our cash flow statement for the first quarter?","Christopher J. Lafond","Correct. So we paid out a $102 million in cash in Q1. There's an escrow amount that's held back and then there is this holdback as well, so there's holdback amounts t that have not been paid out yet in cash.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And can you just again clarify what are the total holdback amounts, both in escrow and this holdback that you're talking about?","Christopher J. Lafond","Approximately $32 million in total.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. If I were looking at the total deal price in theory, it's $102 million that you've already paid out and another $32 million on top of that potentially?","Christopher J. Lafond","Correct.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Brian Shipman for your closing remarks.","Christopher J. Lafond","Great. This is Chris. Just one thing to clarify, there was a couple of questions on the share counts. So just for your modeling, where we ended Q1 was basic shares outstanding of about 90.2 million, and then fully diluted is about 91.7 million. So that's kind of where as of Q1 ending. As I've said, we fully expect by the end of year to be below 90 million fully diluted shares outstanding.","Brian Shipman","Okay. And thank you, everyone, for being with us on today's Q1 2014 earnings call. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us. We'll speak to you again on our 2Q conference call in early August. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your presentation.

With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond.","This call will begin with a discussion of Q3 2012 financial results disclosed in today\u2019s press release, followed by an opportunity for you to ask questions. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the press release is available on our website, that URL is www.gartner.com.","Before we begin, we need to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward-looking statements.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Gartner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Gene?","Gene Hall","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings call and thanks for joining us. We had a great Q3 and our business performed well across all three segments, consistent with our performance since 2009.","For the third quarter, our Research segment achieved double-digit growth in contract value across all regions and in all industry segments. We also achieved 83% client retention, which is an all-time high. Year-over-year, we added more than 800 new client organizations.","Our Consulting segment has strong bookings with our backlog up 14% year-over-year. Our Event segment revenues were up 17% year-over-year on a same Events and FX neutral basis. We\u2019ve achieved these results because of the tremendous value we bring our clients.","This is a unique and exciting time to be an IT. Information technology continues to be the most important driver of growth and productivity for the global economy. But IT\u2019s complex never changing. It\u2019s tough to get it right.","To find solutions to the challenges, CIOs and senior business and IT leaders are coming to Gartner. Gartner is a single best source for the facts, the analysis and the roadmaps our clients need to succeed in this era of unprecedented uncertainty. Our value proportion is stronger today then it\u2019s ever been, putting the Gartner brand and it classify itself.","As you heard me say before, the fundamentals of our strategy are to create extraordinary research insights to build strong sales capability, to deliver high-value differentiate offerings, to provide world-class service and to continue improve our operational effectiveness. This strategy has been successful across all our lines of business and across all geographies.","Gartner Symposium\/ITxpo is our flagship event series and it\u2019s the world\u2019s most important gathering of CIOs and senior IT executives. I just return from a symposium in Orlando, Florida, where we hosted more than 10,000 attendees, which is up more than 18% over last year, and it included more than 2,300 CIOs. It was a largest event yet, it set new records for both attendance and revenue.","At this even I spoke with the number of our clients and I can tell you, they are incredibly excited about the impact of IT on the enterprises and the critical role Gartner plays in helping to achieve their enterprises objectives.","As with the opportunities speak with a large number of our sales people this event and they is enthusiastic about Gartner\u2019s brand and marketing opportunity as I\u2019ve ever seen before.","Like our clients and sales people, I too, I\u2019m extremely excited about Gartner. We have a vast untapped market opportunity, with the right strategy, with the right economic model and the right operating approaches. With these, I believe we will continue to deliver sustained profitable growth over the long-term.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris for additional details, our results, and financial outlook.","Chris Lafond","Thanks, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We deliver another very strong quarter of Q3. On an FX neutral basis we once again achieved double-digit growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow. In Research, year-over-year contract value growth remained strong at 14% on an FX neutral basis and retention rates ended at or near all-time highs.","In Events, our same events revenue were up 17% FX neutral and accelerated in Q3 from Q2, and in Consulting, our benchmark and core consulting practices grew a combined 7% year-over-year FX neutral.","Demand for our services was robust across all three business segments in the third quarter. Our strong topline performance and effective execution in capitalizing on the operating leverage in our business allowed us to once again expand our gross contribution margin, which is now at 60%, up from 59% in Q3 2011.","As a result, we delivered solid growth in earnings in Q3. In the third quarter, normalized EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year and our adjusted earnings per share were up 13%, with this strong performance through the first three quarters of the year, we are well-positioned for strong finish in 2012.","These results again demonstrate the continued successful execution of our strategy, our ability to consistently deliver on the long-term financial objectives we\u2019ve communicated to you over the past few years and the overall value we bring to the strategic IT initiatives of our clients.","Now, I\u2019ll review the results of our three business segments in more detail before we take your questions, and I\u2019ll begin with Research.","Third quarter Research revenue was up 11% on a reported basis to $284 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Research revenue growth was 14% in the quarter.","The margin in this segment increased again to 68% as our strong execution continues to capitalize on the operating leverage inherent in the Research business. All of our key Research business metrics improved or remained very strong in the third quarter.","Contract value grew to a record level of $1.175 billion, a growth rate of 14% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Our growth in contract value in Q3 remained broad-based with all client sizes, all geographies and all industry segments delivering strong double-digit growth year-over-year.","New business again increased from last year continuing the trend we\u2019ve seen since late 2009. The new business mix was balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients.","While our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting, approximately 82% of our year-over-year contract value growth came from volume.","This volume growth reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients. And as a result we ended the quarter with 12,612 client organizations up 7% year-over-year and as per pricing, we\u2019ve consistently increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year on an annual basis since 2005 and that remains our plan into the future.","We maintained client retention near record highs for the past two years and our client retention rate ended the quarter at 83%. In addition to retaining our Research clients in an impressive rate, the clients we retain continue to increase their spending with Gartner and as a result, wallet retention also remained strong at 99%.","Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increase spending by our retained clients and the fact that we retain a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a four-quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","In summary, our research segment continued its strong performance in the third quarter. We grew our contract value by $145 million on an FX neutral basis year-over-year. We continued to see strong demand from clients and we expect continued acceleration in revenue and contract value growth over time. We remain confident in our ability to deliver 15% to 20% annual revenue growth in this business over the long-term.","Turning now to events, our events business continues to deliver exceptionally strong year-over-year growth. And in the same events basis, events revenue growth accelerated in the third quarter from the second quarter of this year, with revenues increasing 17% on FX neutral basis.","On as reported basis, events revenue in the third quarter declined 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. During the third quarter, we held 14 events with 5,566 attendees, compared to 16 events with 6,676 attendees for third quarter of 2011.","Our performance in Q3 was in line with the revenue phasing we provided to you at the beginning of the year as to larger conferences that were held in Q3 2011 are scheduled to occur in Q4 of this year. We are seeing strength in every geography, and across the entire events portfolio particularly at our symposium series events.","Some of you witnessed in Orlando just last week, attendance at our U.S. Symposium\/ITxpo was up over 18%. Our events business remains well-positioned to deliver continued strong growth in the final quarter of 2012 and beyond.","Moving on to consulting. Revenues in our Consulting business grew 1% on an as reported basis in the quarter and 4% on an FX neutral basis. Our benchmark in core consulting businesses delivered strong results of a combined 7% on an FX neutral basis year-over-year in the quarter.","Our Q3 Consulting segment results were impacted by our contract optimization business, which can vary from quarter to quarter given the nature of that business. Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for consulting ended the quarter at $106.1 million, or healthy four months of backlog. Our pipeline remains solid as we enter the fourth quarter.","Billable headcount of 499 was up 4% from the third quarter of 2011 and up from last quarter. Utilization for Q3 was over 64%, up 280 basis points from the third quarter, a year ago and revenue per billable headcount remained above $400,000 per year ending the quarter at $415,000.","With a solid third quarter, four months of backlog and a strong future pipeline, the Consulting business is on track to deliver results in line with our long-term targets.","Moving down the income statement, during the third quarter, our total gross contribution margin increased by 52 basis points year-over-year to 60%. This increase was driven by margin improvement in our research segment and in particular, successful execution of our strategy and consistently strong expense management continues to capitalize on a high incremental margins and operating leverage inherent in our research business.","SG&A increased by $16 million year-over-year during the third quarter. And this increase was primarily attributable to the continued growth in our sales force. As of September 30, we had 1,397 quota-bearing sales associates as compared to 1,215 a year ago. This represents a 15% growth year-over-year which is in line with our long-term target of growing our sales force by 15% to 20% per year.","Moving on to earnings, we delivered another strong quarter of solid earnings growth. Normalized EBITDA was $68 million in the third quarter, up 9% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share were $0.33.","Note that GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were negatively impacted by $0.02 of acquisition-related charges. Our normalized EBITDA margin was 18.2% for the quarter. All of this is consistent with the phasing guidance per earnings that we laid out at our Investor Day in February.","Turning to cash, our strong performance so far this year translated into a significant year-over-year increase in cash from operations, which was $209 million through the first nine months of 2012 as compared to 1000 -- excuse me, $177 million for the same period in 2011.","Over the long-term, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow substantially greater than our net income given our tight cash management and the negative working capital characteristics of our research business. In the first nine months of 2012, we utilized cash on the acquisition of Ideas International and we utilized over $89 million in cash for purchasing over 2 million shares of our own stock.","We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet in cash position with net cash of $55 million. Our current credit facility runs through December 2015. And at this time provides us with almost $354 million of available borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value.","We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. In absence of appropriate acquisition opportunities, we believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital and we have $231 million remaining under our board authorization.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to our business outlook for the remainder of 2012. Our business remains well positioned for another year of strong growth in revenue and earnings. The details of our guidance are included in the press release issued this morning, only take a moment to highlight some of the changes.","Overall, on a consolidated basis, we\u2019re raising the low-end of our previous issued guidance by $7 million per revenue and lowering the high end of our previous issued revenue guidance by $13 million. With respect to our research segment, we now expect revenues between $1.13 billion and $1.14 billion for the full year. This represents growth between 12% and 13% on a reported basis for the full year.","With respect to Consulting, we now expect revenues of between $310 million and $320 million, which is growth of between 1% and 4% on a reported basis for the full year. And finally with regard to our events business, we now expect revenues of between $167 million and $177 million. The increase in our guidance for this segment is a result not only of the strength we\u2019ve seen through the first three quarters but also what we\u2019re seeing in our global symposium series.","We\u2019re seeing double-digit revenue growth at all of these events. And as a recent example, our U.S. symposium recently held in Orlando delivered an 18% increase of attendees and 25% increase in exhibitors.","From a seasonality perspective, I will remind you that the fourth quarter is the largest quarter of the year for the events business and will make up greater than 50% of the full year revenues for that segment. There are no other changes to our previously issued guidance.","So to summarize, we delivered great results for the third quarter of 2012 and demand for our services is strong. We generated double-digit revenue growth on an FX neutral basis and our key business metrics remains strong in the third quarter.","Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness coupled with the positive operating leverage inherent in our business delivered strong operating margins. And we continue to generate substantial operating cash flow.","We will continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. And we expect to repurchase shares throughout 2012 and beyond.","And finally with double-digit growth in contract value in the third quarter, we established a solid foundation for delivering a strong year of revenue and earnings growth for the remainder of 2012. We remained well positioned to continue our consistent delivery of double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing returns to our shareholders over the long term.","We\u2019ll now be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please proceed.","Tim McHugh - William Blair","Hi. Yeah. Can I ask about the sales force growth? It\u2019s still within, as you said, 15% to 20% range but last couple of quarter, it grew from the high end of that range down towards the lower end. Can you talk about what -- do you expect to reaccelerate that and does that in anyway reflect the macro environment or is it just a reality having to hiring and grow our sales force?","Gene Hall","Yeah. Hi. It\u2019s Gene. Great question. So, basically our sales force growth as you alluded to as Chris mentioned is, our targets is 15% to 20% a year. Last year, we grew a little bit -- actually above the top of the range. And this year we\u2019re kind of Tim as you said toward the lower end of that range.","And it\u2019s clearly based on operational aspects and as we looked at it because we were a little higher last year, we are kind of being very picky to who we hire this year and making sure we get all the right people. But it\u2019s not either lack of the reflux of the environment, the economic environment anything like that.","We have robust demand as we mentioned robust demand across geographies and across industries. And it\u2019s purely what we think is right amount to optimize our operational effectiveness.","Tim McHugh - William Blair","Okay. Great. But as it relates to the research guidance, can you talk a little bit, you brought down the high end of that a little bit, I guess, even as contract value growth has remained pretty strong here. So can we understand why or what change there in terms of the assumption?","Gene Hall","Yeah. It\u2019s really no significant change to our thinking for the year as you think about as we think about guidance. Obviously, we get to the fourth quarter with the subscription model. We have pretty good clarity on how the year is going to end. And so as we sit here now looking into fourth quarter, I think all the analysts were more toward the lower end. We were looking at the revenue expectations based on the 14% growth and it will get you right in the range that -- that we gave.","So, nothing has changed from our perspective in terms of business performance, nothing has changed in terms of expectations for the remainder of the year. And obviously fourth quarter bookings and contract value have very little impact on the quarter, have a much bigger impact moving into next year as we lend out those revenues over the life of those contracts. So, that\u2019s why we take in the range and we tend to do that every fourth quarter and research impact across all three segments as we get closer to the end of the year.","Tim McHugh - William Blair","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Thanks. So, Gene just following upon the prior question about sales force growth, I think there have been some expectation just among investors perhaps that -- given that you have been at the higher end of the range in terms of sales force growth, we might see some modest acceleration through the year in CV growth.","And the CV growth has been graded 14% but pretty consistent through the year. So does this imply that you are not getting quite the level of productivity that you might have anticipated from some of the new hires?","Gene Hall","Yeah. Peter, great question. So, first the -- we\u2019re very happy with our results. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve got double-digit growth all geographies in all industries and so we are very happy with performance.","When we hire new people, obviously it takes time to get among Board, get them trained, get full productivity and we think they are coming along just as pretty much as we\u2019d expect. So, it\u2019s going to ride what we expected to be.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Would it be realistic to expect given the -- you are going to presumably end this year with something like 15% sales force growth. Would it be realistic to expect some modest acceleration in CV growth in 2013?","Gene Hall","I think as we add sales people and those group become productive. Overtime, their productivity increases and that\u2019s what accelerates our sales force growth. I mean our CV growth.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then Chris in terms of the margin leverage, it\u2019s sort of interesting last quarter, I think if I got the numbers right, the EBITDA margin was up something better than 100 bps year-to-year this quarter up more like 30, what drives the variance from quarter-to-quarter?","Chris Lafond","Just it\u2019s a couple of things, Peter. First, if you look at our events business, there is some movement there. You can see if you look at the year-over-year margin that you will see that is down a bit. And the reason for that is the shift in the schedule, right so. Third quarter tends to be our lowest quarter for the events business, our smallest number of event held.","We moved two of our more established events that were held in Q3 last year and the Q4. And so when you moved those events and the profitability that goes with them, even though we launched two new events the profitability is not quite the same and then -- and obviously, it\u2019s a bunch of fixed cost in events that occur every year regardless of how many events we hold in a quarter.","So, when you look at that, that was a bit of the driver of the year-over-year performance. If you look on a full-year basis, we\u2019re still expecting really nice margin expansion. And so its really just a timing between quarters and events being kind of the biggest portion of that.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Got it. That makes sense. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Karimzad with GS. Please proceed.","Brian Karimzad - GS","Hi, there. Just again the follow-up on the sales force productivity. I mean has anything changed this cycle in terms of ramping folks versus the last time you did pre-recession. You did a ramp like this where people get a bit hung up on coming up to the curve. I know the -- in terms of the mix of customers is probably different than what you dealt with prior?","Gene Hall","Yeah. It\u2019s Gene. So, basically we are seeing as we bring new people on. We are seeing productivity grow at pretty much the exact rate we would expect overtime. It changes the mix of how many new -- faster we grow the mix of new people sales force goes up little bit, which affects the average. But in terms of -- we look at it by vintage in each class and what we\u2019re seeing is pretty much what we\u2019d expect.","Brian Karimzad - GS","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Dan Leben. Please proceed.","Dan Leben - Robert W. Baird","Great. Could you just talk a little bit about the sales retention and your efforts there, how that\u2019s played out as you\u2019ve been more selective on the hiring?","Gene Hall","Dan, are you talking about our retention of sales people?","Dan Leben - Robert W. Baird","Yeah.","Gene Hall","Yeah. Great. Retention of sales people is actually very important to us because we\u2019d like to retain as many of our sales people we can. We track it very closely. In fact, we interview every sales person that leaves, so we get an assessment of kind of what\u2019s going on in terms of their -- why they\u2019re leaving.","The people that leave our overwhelming people that have not done as well performance wise. And so basically and we tracked that and that continues to be the case. And so we feedback that in because it really means that we haven\u2019t hire somebody that\u2019s the best person at the Gartner.","And so we really focused on looking at what the attrition is, what causes it and then what do we do to actually keep driving that down? Because overtime, we\u2019d like to get that penetration. You\u2019re recall in the normal sales force what we talked at four, which is going to 15% to 20% range.","And the attrition that\u2019s the range we\u2019ve been in, that\u2019s the range we\u2019re still in and -- but we love to get at kind of below that 15% mark because we think that would give more continuity to the sales force and have a possible impact on productivity. So, it\u2019s obviously when we hire people, we like to see that why they\u2019re successful. We don\u2019t like hiring people that maybe not best for Gartner.","Dan Leben - Robert W. Baird","Great. And then Chris looking forward to the fourth quarter when we reset the FX adjustment on contract value, what rates we\u2019re at today, what type of a change are we looking for, for next quarter?","Chris Lafond","Today, we probably very minimal, because rates have come back pretty close to where they were at the beginning of the year. Just for everybody\u2019s benefit, we established for CV reporting purposes a fixed foreign exchange rate for the entire year. So the numbers you see in our results are always FX neutral numbers for contract value.","We don\u2019t try to assume where they will be, when we get to January we will use rates that are in January and that\u2019s the rates we use for the whole year.","Dan Leben - Robert W. Baird","Great. And then last one for me. Just within Consulting in the fourth quarter a big contract optimization quarter, help us understand if there is any crowding out of time usage of consultants as contract optimization either goes through and their ability to work on that already pre-booked backlog?","Gene Hall","Hey, Dan. Great question. It\u2019s Gene. The consultants that work in the contract optimization business are separate from the rest of the business. All they do is contract optimization work. So, it doesn\u2019t affect the rest of the business. So, if there is backlog in the rest of the business, it has no impact at all on the contract optimization consultants.","Dan Leben - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [Anj Singh] with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Anj Singh - Credit Suisse","Hello. I am calling in for Kelly Flynn. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question was if you can comment on how you are seeing client spending if there are any constraints that have come up or gone away over the recent quarter?","Gene Hall","Yeah. So, I said the recent quarter is not much different than what we\u2019ve seen in the other quarters this year. There are lot of institutions and a lot of distress. You look at the public sector -- there are lot of public sector institutions. In the private sector, there are some large institutions. There are lot of financial distress.","I read about it in the news everyday. But that\u2019s not much changed from what it was before. And for our business, it basically doesn\u2019t affect our business. We are just as helpful in helping clients in distress and it is just as common to growth those clients at the same rate as we have clients that are not in distress. And so for us, it\u2019s just if they want to use different products of our service line, different. Their folk stars are taking the cost reduction as opposed to interesting new products and wealthy stuff like that. But I\u2019d say not much different than what we\u2019ve seen before.","Anj Singh - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you. And one follow-up. The consulting backlog was really strong this quarter and I know you said that the strength was quite broad based. I was wondering if for Consulting, you can get a little bit more granular as to where the pockets of strengths might be.","Gene Hall","Sure. Thanks for the question. If you look over the past few quarters, we had seen as we\u2019ve said pretty balanced performance across all of our businesses in all the segments. We\u2019ve had pretty strong performance throughout the year in Europe, but I would say in the third quarter we had a particularly strong performance in North America.","And I would say that really picked up nicely for us from a year-over-year perspective. And all-in-all, as we look across the entire portfolio, we are seeing good demand across all the places that we are doing Consulting, which is, as you know limited to North America, major countries in Europe and Japan. But we are doing well across all of those.","Anj Singh - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays. Please proceed.","Gary Bisbee - Barclays","Hi. Pitching in for, Manav, this morning. I had two questions if I could. The first one is the Event business continues to be very strong and I guess, could you give us a sense what impact the weaker economic activity in Europe is having on that business, and are there other areas that are much stronger in making up for that.","And the second part of the question. How big historically, a driver of incremental business wins in the Research business have the Events been, are those largely existing customers or is that proven to be a good source of future growth in the Research business?","Gene Hall","So, great question. So first one, our Events business has had great strength across all areas of world just like our Research business. So, if you look at even the areas of world that have been weaker, we\u2019ve had great performance. There\u2019s nothing like -- there\u2019s one really strong region and the others are not. It\u2019s very balanced performance, again just like in our Research business.","And so and what\u2019s going on there is again, technology is critical for just about every initiative that institutions want to undertake and so even in bad times people are undertaking these initiatives to improve their operations. It could be cost reduction. It could be a growth oriented, but they are still using IT. And so even in areas that have real distress are still spending money on IT. And especially, getting help to make sure the IT investments are used wisely, which is what we help them do.","In terms of Events impact on our research business, basically our Events segment is a great standalone segment. We love the Event business. There\u2019s a mix of people there that some of them are research clients, and some of them are people that are not research clients.","The reason people come to our Events is because they would rather immerse themselves in our Research for a few days, and get offsite as opposed to use the written research which a lot of our clients do. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the differences between two businesses and why we have people there. And again, it\u2019s both research clients as well as people that are not research clients.","Gary Bisbee - Barclays","Has that proven to be a fertile ground for driving the Research business or is it more the one for our clients more, they come in and pay the fee and get a few days of it and then move on?","Gene Hall","Yeah. It\u2019s certainly not the biggest source of our growth in Research, so. Of course, there are people there that want to become research clients, but it\u2019s not the engine driving the growth of our Research business.","Gary Bisbee - Barclays","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Sutherland with Northland Capital Market. Please proceed.","Bill Sutherland - Northland Capital","Hey. Good morning. Just a couple of quick number questions. So, do you think you\u2019ll be -- you\u2019ve had some steady increases in the billable accounting consulting, is that likely to continue?","Chris Lafond","All right, Bill. It\u2019s Chris. I think the way we think about Consulting, and the way we talk about it all the time is that we add capacity as we see our backlog build. And so we\u2019ve seen a really nice increase in the backlog in the third quarter. And so, yeah, you should expect to continue to see continued growth in headcount commensurable. We need to do to deliver those services.","So, I would say you\u2019ll see that continue. To grow, we absolutely believe we can drive more productivity out of the consultants we have. So there is certainly a productivity benefit here that we expect to get in addition to hiring more billable consultants.","Bill Sutherland - Northland Capital","And, Chris, did the three parts of Consulting kind of grow in tandem, or were there differences?","Chris Lafond","No. Actually, if you think back to the comments I made just to reclarify them, our core Consulting and benchmark businesses were up a combined 7% FX neutral. So really strong performance in that area, and the contract optimization business was down year-over-year, and still we feel very confident in the guidance we provided. So no issues from a full-year perspective as we think about that business. But really the strength in the performance came out of the core and benchmark.","Bill Sutherland - Northland Capital","Thanks. I have to jump around a little bit. Appreciate that. And then the number of Events for Q4, remind me?","Chris Lafond","Hold on one second, I think we have held 48 events for the year. We are planning to hold about 65, so another just under 20 Events in the quarter.","Bill Sutherland - Northland Capital","Okay. I\u2019ll do the math. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Brian Shipman for any closing remarks.","Brian Shipman","Thank you, Erica. And thank you everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call, and we\u2019ll speak to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Shipman","Thank you and good morning everyone.  Welcome to Gartner\u2019s First Quarter 2012 Earnings call.  With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall, and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond.  This call will begin with a discussion of Q1 2012 financial results disclosed in today\u2019s press release, followed by an opportunity for you to ask questions.  I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the press release is available on our website.  That URL is www.gartner.com.","Before we begin, we need to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward-looking statements.","With that, I\u2019d like to hand the call over to Gartner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.  Gene?","Eugene Hall","Good morning everyone.  Welcome to our first earnings call for 2012.  We had a great first quarter and our business is performing extraordinarily well.  We continue to experience the strong growth trends we saw in 2011 and our business accelerated in all three segments.  As you\u2019ll hear in more detail from Chris, Gartner is in the strongest position we\u2019ve ever been.  Research, our largest and most profitable segment, continues to grow at double-digit growth rates.  Consulting had its strongest quarter in years and events continued to exceed our long-term growth targets.","Normalized EBITDA was up 11% and diluted earnings per share was up 24% over first quarter 2011.  These results demonstrate the strength achieved through successful execution of our consistent strategy.  Our sales capabilities were the strongest we\u2019ve ever had.  The productivity of our new hires is on a great trajectory and we\u2019re bringing in strong talent.  We continue to invest in our sales force and benefit from great sales leadership.  ","I recently spent several days at a meeting with several hundred of our top performing sales associates.  They are excited about Gartner.  They know we deliver a huge value to our clients and they also know the importance and relevance of our insights within our client organizations is growing.  Why?  Because IT is one of the most important drivers of growth and competitive advantage for virtually every institution in the world, and IT is complex and continuously evolving.","Whether an organization is looking to leverage technology to achieve rapid growth or whether they are looking to manage costs, Gartner is the best resource these professionals can turn to for help, and our assistance often makes the difference between success and failure for our clients.  Because of this, we benefit from a vast untapped market opportunity for our services which, as I stated before, we estimate at $47 billion.  ","There are hundreds of thousands of IT and supply chain professionals who could potentially be Gartner clients but had never been educated on the value we can provide.  The same is true of our events business, which continues to deliver extraordinary performance.  ","We have the right strategy to capture this opportunity.  As some of you know, the fundamentals of our strategy are to create extraordinary research insights, to build strong sales capability, to deliver high value differentiated offerings, to provide world-class service, and to continually improve our operational effectiveness.  This consistent strategy is driving our growth and will allow us to maintain sustained double-digit growth over time.  I remain confident in and excited about our prospects for sustained accelerated growth.  The Gartner brand is in a class by itself.  Our products, services and people are superior to the competition and we have a successful and attractive business model.  ","We delivered another successive quarter of strong growth and we\u2019re well poised to achieve strong results in 2012 and beyond.  As you\u2019ll hear from Chris in a minute, we demonstrated growth across all three of our business segments as well as in normalized EBITDA and diluted EPS.  Our business model is attractive with high renewal rates, great cash flow, and incremental margins, and we have the right strategy to achieve our goals.  Finally, we\u2019re well positioned to achieve our long-term targets with the leading brand in IT and supply chain research, a strong value proposition for our clients, great operational capabilities, and a vast untapped market opportunity.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Chris so he can comment in detail on our performance.","Christopher Lafond","Thanks, Gene.  Good morning everyone.  2012 is off to a strong start.  In the first quarter, we once again achieved double-digit growth in revenue, earnings, and cash flow.  Each of our three segments delivered strong results and contributed meaningfully to our overall Q1 performance.  In research, year-over-year contract value growth remains strong at 14% and retention rates ended at or near all-time highs.  In consulting, year-over-year revenue growth of 6% was at the high end of our long-term expectations, and in events both the attendees and exhibitors increased by double digits year-over-year, resulting in 31% year-over-year revenue growth.","Demand for our services was robust across all three business segments in the first quarter.  Our strong top line performance and effective execution in capitalizing on the operating leverage in our business allowed us to once again expand our growth contribution margin which is now at 61%, up from 59% in Q1 2011.  As a result, we delivered significant growth in earnings in Q1.  In the first quarter, normalized EBITDA increased 11% year-over-year and our GAAP diluted earnings per share were up 24%.  With this strong start, we are well positioned for continued growth for the remainder of 2012.","These results again demonstrate the continued successful execution of our strategy, our ability to deliver consistently on the long-term financial objectives we\u2019ve communicated over the past several years, and the overall value we bring to strategic IT initiatives of our clients.  ","I\u2019ll now review the results of our three business segments in more detail and then we\u2019ll take your questions.  Let me begin with research.  First quarter research revenue was up 13% to 275 million with a negligible impact from foreign exchange in the quarter.  The margin in this segment increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 68.7% as our strong execution continues to capitalize on the operating leverage inherent in this business.  All of our key research business metrics remained very strong in the first quarter.  Contract value grew to a record level of 1.111 billion, a growth rate of 14% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis.  Our growth in contract value in Q1 remained extremely broad based with all geographies, client sizes, and industry segments delivering strong year-over-year growth.","New business again increased from last year, continuing the trends we\u2019ve seen since late 2009.  The new business mix was balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients.  While our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting, approximately 85% of our contract value growth came from volume with the balance coming from price increases.  This volume growth reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients, and as a result we ended the quarter with 12,303 client organizations, up 6% year-over-year; and as for pricing, we\u2019ve consistently increased our prices by 3 to 6% per year on an annual basis since 2005, and that remains our plan again in 2012.","We\u2019ve maintained client retention near record highs for the past two years, and our client retention rate ended the quarter at 82%.  In addition to retaining our research clients at an impressive rate, the clients we retain continue to increase their spending with Gartner and as a result, wallet retention also remains strong at 99%.  Wallet retention is higher than client retention due a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our largest clients.  As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a four-quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.  ","In summary, our research segment continued its strong performance in the first quarter.  We grew our contract value by $134 million on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year.  We continued to see strong demand from clients, and we expect continued acceleration in revenue and contract value growth over time.  We remain confident in our ability to deliver 15 to 20% annual revenue growth in this business over the long term.","Turning now to events, our events business continued to deliver exceptionally strong year-over-year growth.  Events revenue in the first quarter increased 29% year-over-year on a reported basis and 31% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.  During the first quarter, we held 13 events with 5,707 attendees, compared to 11 events with 4,337 attendees in the first quarter of 2011.  On a same events basis, total attendees at our events during Q1 were up 13% year-over-year and exhibitors were up 12%, in line with the guidance we provided to you for the full year 2012.  ","We are seeing strength in every geography and across the entire portfolio.  Our events business is well positioned to deliver continued growth throughout 2012 and beyond.","Moving now to consulting, revenues in our consulting business grew 6% in the first quarter, again with a negligible impact from foreign exchange.  Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for consulting, ended the quarter at 95.5 million or a healthy four months of backlog.  This is 10% higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and the largest year-over-year increase in a Q1 since 2008.  Our pipeline looks equally solid as we enter the second quarter.","Billable headcount of 476 was down 1% from the first quarter of 2011.  Utilization for Q1 was over 70%, up 260 basis points from the first quarter a year ago, and revenue from billable headcount remained above $400,000 per year, ending the quarter at 437,000.  With a strong first quarter, a four-month existing backlog, and a strong future pipeline, the consulting business is on track to deliver a strong performance in 2012.","Moving down the income statement, during the first quarter our total gross contribution margin increased by 134 basis points year-over-year to 61%.  This increase was driven by margin improvements in all three of our segments as we expanded margins while significantly growing each segment; and in particular, the successful execution of our strategy continues to capitalize on the high incremental margins and operating leverage inherent in our research business. ","SG&A increased by 21 million year-over-year during the first quarter.  The increase was primarily attributable to the continued growth in our sales force.  As of March 31, we had 1,288 quota-bearing sales associates as compared to 1,091 a year ago, which represents 18% growth year-over-year, and this is in line with our long-term target for growing our sales force by 15 to 20% per year.  As we discussed during our last earnings call, our aggressive hiring in Q4 put us in a great position to start the year, and we continue to see a strong recruiting pipeline with high quality potential candidates.","Moving on to earnings, we delivered another strong quarter of solid earnings growth.  Normalized EBITDA was 71 million in the first quarter, up 11% year-over-year, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.36, up 24% year-over-year.  Our normalized EBITDA margin was 19.3%, and all of this is consistent with the phase-in guidance we laid out at our investor day in February.","Now turning to cash, our strong performance in the first quarter translated into significant year-over-year increase in cash from operations, which was 18 million as compared to negative 25 million in Q1 of 2011.  Q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter for operating cash flow given the timing of our annual bonus and commission payments and other factors.  Over the long term, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow substantially greater than our net income, given our tight cash management and the negative working capital characteristics of our research business.  ","During the first quarter, we utilized our cash to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program.  We repurchased almost 2 million shares at a total cost of over $77 million.  We also announced our intention to acquire Ideas International for roughly 20 million, which we expect will close in the second quarter.  ","We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position with net debt of $101 million.  Our current credit facility runs through December 2015 and at this time provides us with almost 330 million of remaining borrowing capacity.  We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value.  We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash.  In the absence of appropriate acquisition opportunities, we believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of capital, and we have 237 million remaining under our Board authorization.  ","Let me close with our business outlook for 2012.  Our business remains well positioned for another year of strong growth in revenues and earnings.  The first quarter modestly exceeded our original expectations with particularly strong performances in both consulting and events.  Coupled with our continued careful expense management, we once again delivered double-digit growth in earnings.  We remain confident in the guidance we provided at the start of the year, given this strong start.","So to summarize, we delivered great results in the first quarter of 2012 and demand for our services is strong.  We generated double-digit revenue growth and our key business metrics remain solid in the first quarter of 2012.  Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness coupled with the positive operating leverage inherent in our businesses delivered strong operating margins, and we continued to generate substantial operating cash flow.  As always, we\u2019re actively exploring strategic alternatives for deploying our cash.  We will continue to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we expect to repurchase shares throughout 2012.","Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in the first quarter, we established a solid foundation for delivering a strong year of revenue and earnings growth in 2012.  We remain well positioned to continue our consistent delivery of double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing returns to our shareholders over the long term.","We will now be happy to take your questions.  Operator?","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your touchtone telephone.  If your question has been answered or you wish to withdraw your question, press star followed by two.  Press star, one to begin, and please stand by for your first question.","Your first question comes from the line of Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray.  Thank you.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks, good morning.  So Chris or Gene, I know you don\u2019t give guidance, obviously, on contract value; but I was hoping you might give us a little color in terms of what your expectations are in terms of what that number should look like over the balance of 2012. I ask this, obviously, in the context of the sales force growth you had last year, when we start to see the impact from that in terms of the CV number.  Thanks.","Eugene Hall","Hey Peter, it\u2019s Gene.  Great question.  So as we\u2019ve talked about before, the way sales force growth works basically is when we hire salespeople, we bring them on board, train them.  They then have their first year of sales, which they\u2019re not as effective as in their second year.  The second year, they\u2019re up to full productivity in sales, and then that turns into contract value during that second year which then turns into revenue, really, during their third year.  And so if you look at our hiring from last year, which was intended to be more back-end loaded through the year \u2013 we hired more aggressively toward the second half of the year \u2013 you\u2019d start to see the impact of contract value really\u2014from those guys, the big impact is going to be in 2013, not in 2012.","And Chris, you want to add anything to that?","Christopher Lafond","No.  Peter, I think the only other thing I would add to that, as you know, we track and monitor sales productivity consistently, and so as we add sales resources, we do it with a knowledge that they are coming up to speed.  The new hires are coming up to speed nicely for us.  We feel really good about sales productivity, and so we\u2019re not looking for one quarter as vindication for a certain strategy of continuing to hire.  We think that over the long term, we are going to be seeing continued growth in our sales force because all of the metrics say that as we do that, what Gene just laid out will continue to materialize.  We\u2019ll continue to see them come up to speed, and over that period of time as they get up to speed, we\u2019ll see that revenue growth and contract value growth ramp.  So we\u2019re very, very confident in the guidance that we give and our ability to drive that research business in the 15 to 20% range as we continue executing the strategy.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","And did you think 15 to 20% is a reasonable number for 2012?","Christopher Lafond","Well, we\u2019ve given guidance already, Peter, on the revenue line, and so obviously as we\u2019ve talked about at the fourth quarter last year, the 2012 revenue growth is a function of the contract value we delivered in 2011, and so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve given the guidance we\u2019ve given for this year \u2013 because for the most part, the growth in contract value this year, as you know, tends to be more towards the back end of the year, which will really affect 2013.  So we don\u2019t give guidance on contract value growth, but we give revenue growth and so as Gene said, we will expect over time to certainly see it ramping as the sales force gets up to speed as continue hiring at the pace we\u2019re hiring.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, fair enough.  And then you were obviously at the high end, or slightly above the high end, in terms of the sales force expansion last year.  Will this year look the same?","Christopher Lafond","Well, what we\u2019ve said over time is we expect to be in the 15 to 20% range.  As we talked about at the end of last year, we saw a great quality of candidates that came in.  We hired a little bit ahead and really filled some of the open positions that we had hoped to hire early in Q1 of 2012, at the end of 2011.  So actually, we\u2019re in a much better position starting this year and getting people up to speed early in the year, so hopefully we\u2019ll have a stronger back half of the year with more people early on.  So I still expect us to be in the 15 to 20% range, and that\u2019s where we would expect to be over time.","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Got it, okay.  One last thing \u2013 Chris, EBITDA margin flat year-to-year around 19.3%.  Anything to read into that in terms of your longer term expectation that you can grow the margins, I think it\u2019s 100 to 150 BPs a year?","Christopher Lafond","No, not at all.  I think that as we talked about at the end of last quarter, we certainly hired pretty aggressively the sales force.  We knew that would impact Q1 in terms of we had a lot more people on board in sales in Q1 than we did at the prior year.  We still feel very comfortable over time to drive that margin up at the 50 to 150 basis points per year, and as we\u2019ve talked about many times, getting that into the mid-20s is exactly where we still expect to be able to drive the business.  ","Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Your next question comes from the line of William Bird, Lazard.  Please go ahead.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard","Good morning.  On the topic of sales force growth, was there any particular reason why the sequential sales force growth was somewhat low at 1.5%?  You\u2019ve been throttling at 4 to 5.  Just wondering if there was any market factor or any other explanation.  Thank you.","Eugene Hall","Hey, it\u2019s Gene.  No, there was no market factor.  What happened basically was we have a terrific recruiting team, built a pipeline of people.  We had a very strong pipeline in Q4.  We just closed people more.  We hired more people in Q4 from that pipeline that we expected we were going to hire in Q1, so I think basically it\u2019s just we hired a little ahead of where we thought we would be in the pipeline.  So there\u2019s no reason, and I think, again as Chris, we fully expect our sales force growth this year to be again in the 15 to 20% range.  We were just fortunate enough to be a little ahead.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard","And then on productivity, are there any other factors just beyond the on-boarding dilution that might be weighing on productivity?","Eugene Hall","So actually on productivity, we take our productivity and disaggregate it between experienced people and new people, and what we\u2019re seeing basically is that in our experienced people, the productivity is doing great and actually we\u2019ve been seeing with each class of new hires we\u2019ve been hiring that in fact the productivity has been increasing over time.  But obviously if you have more of those new hires who in their first year, as I mentioned, have lower productivity, that can take the overall number\u2014it dilutes the overall number a little bit, as you pointed out.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard","And then just finally, I was just wondering if you could touch on Europe.  How are trends holding up there?","Eugene Hall","So we\u2019ve had great growth across all geographies, including Europe.  No big issues.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard","I might have missed it \u2013 did you give a growth number of Europe?","Christopher Lafond","Hey Bill, it\u2019s Chris.  No, we don\u2019t\u2014we\u2019ve not broken that out.  We don\u2019t break out growth by geography.  What I will tell you is if you look across all three businesses, our events are doing great in Europe.  Consulting is actually particularly strong in Europe and we\u2019ve got great backlog growth there, and when you look at research and the CV growth year-over-year, it is extremely balanced, including across the various parts of the world, and Europe continuing to grow double digit as well.  So we\u2019ve seen great growth in all three of our segments in Europe.","William Bird \u2013 Lazard","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and your next question comes from the line of Robert Riggs, William Blair.  Thank you.","Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair","Good morning.  Thanks for taking my question.  Gene, you mentioned recently attending an event with some of your top salespeople.  What were some of the common themes or maybe requests from them in terms of additional tools, resources that would maybe help them be more productive?","Eugene Hall","That\u2019s a great question, Robert.  Yeah, I was at an event with several hundred of our top salespeople, so it was a great opportunity to kind of network and understand their perspective on how we\u2019re doing.  They had an incredible level of enthusiasm, as you can imagine, because of the kind of unlimited market opportunity that we have and the great market position we have, so it\u2019s always interesting to go and talk to them.  ","We have a strategy of continuing to add tools to our sales force over time, as you pointed out, to help improve the productivity of our salespeople over time.  We solicit their input all the time as a part of developing that, as so as you point out, they always have some ideas about how to improve those tools, not just for this particular forum but we do it on a systematic basis as well.  But you know, they have great tools as it is.  It\u2019s those things that kind of add another 5% in terms of the tool capability as opposed to there\u2019s a big gaping hole somewhere, something like that.  And again, we get input there but we do it actually in a more systematic fashion with focus groups and work analysis and stuff like that as well.  But they have a great set of tools.","Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair","Great.  And then, consulting was strong in the quarter.  Was there a particular bucket of work that exceeded expectations, and then maybe if you could just give us an update on the managing partner strategy, how that\u2019s progressing in terms of availability of people, bringing people on there.","","Eugene Hall","It\u2019s a great question.  So our consulting business, we\u2019ve worked hard over the last couple of years to really get the right strategy in place, and as you pointed out, a big part of that strategy is building a cadre of managing partners.  In addition to that, it involves focusing our service lines on the areas that have the highest demand, and both those strategies have been working extraordinarily well as we\u2019ve gotten them in place.","In terms of the actual numbers, I\u2019ll let Chris answer that.","Christopher Lafond","Yeah, hey Rob.  It\u2019s Chris.  What I would tell you is we\u2019ve increased roughly 10% probably in the MP ranks, so as we\u2019ve talked about over time, this is a multi-year investment.  We\u2019ve been making that investment while delivering continued great improvements in that business, improving and expanding margins.  So we\u2019re now getting close to 80 managing partners in that business, and we still have some more to go there to fully cover, but we feel really good about the progress.","Robert Riggs \u2013 William Blair","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you, and your next question comes from Manav Patnaik, Barclays.  Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Hey, good morning gentlemen.  A few quick questions \u2013 on the SG&A line, can you give us a sense of what the non\u2014I guess the (audio interference), the other cost?","Christopher Lafond","I would say the non-sales related costs effectively are probably growing in the 3ish to 4%-ish range.  You know, most of the G&A functions we\u2019re managing and are growing more in that range.  We certainly have a few investments in HR to support the growth in other areas, so we have a couple of pockets of places that are probably growing a little faster than that, but the vast majority of the year-over-year growth in the SG&A line is really coming from the continued investment in our sales force.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Okay.  And can you maybe help us understand the\u2014I guess the number of client organizations was down sequentially, and I was just trying to understand if there is a seasonal dynamic to that, or what happened there?","Christopher Lafond","There is a seasonal dynamic.  If you look at past years, you\u2019ll see that oftentimes there\u2019s a little bit of a dip in Q1.  As you know, Q1 tends to be our lowest quarter of new business and new enterprise growth, and it tends to be more focused on retention as we go through the year and then we have a lot more new enterprises and new businesses coming in towards the back half of the year.  So it is a normal kind of seasonal pattern.  As you look year-over-year, we\u2019re still penetrating new organizations, adding new enterprises, so we feel very comfortable with what we\u2019re seeing in terms of our ability to continue to grow the business and penetrate new clients.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","And what percentage of renewals\u2014I think you had mentioned last time it is in the fourth quarter, first quarter?","Christopher Lafond","It\u2019s relatively balanced.  It goes anywhere from probably 22 to 23% in our smallest quarter up to 26, 27%.  So every quarter, you\u2019re seeing close to 25% of our business come up for renewal, so you\u2019re getting a good picture of renewal activity with our retention rates every quarter.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Okay, and last question \u2013 I guess based on your seasonal\u2014or sorry, quarterly phase-in guidance that you provided for EPS, if 19% was what you said for the first quarter, that would imply that the 36 takes you above your guidance range.  Are there any changes, I guess, to that?","Christopher Lafond","No, we\u2019re not seeing any changes, as I talked about.  We were modestly above where we expected to be in Q1 primarily because of stronger performances in both consulting and events, and at this point given where we are, we\u2019re not expecting any changes to our full-year guidance.  We have some hiring a little below our original expectations.  We certainly expect that to pick back up and hire to the levels of the demand we\u2019re seeing and the revenue; so as you noticed, for example, consulting headcount was down slightly.  Our plan is for that to grow as we continue to see growth in backlog, so you\u2019ll continue to see expense there.  So we right now don\u2019t see any changes to full year and where we expect to be.","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays","Okay, fair enough.  Good job, guys.","Christopher Lafond","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and your next question comes from Kelly Flynn, CS.  Thank you.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks.  Quick question about the financial services industry exposure \u2013 can you give a rough estimate of how much of your revenue comes from that sector, and maybe speak to how experience in that sector is tracking versus other sectors; and more broadly, any kind of industry pockets of strength versus weakness globally?","Christopher Lafond","Hey Kelly, it\u2019s Chris.  A couple things I would say \u2013 first is our overall mix of business is roughly equates to the overall economy.  So when you look at our business mix, we\u2019re not really overweight or underweight in various industries.  We\u2019re really balance in terms of how the overall economy looks, and that\u2019s how you should think about our business.  So we don\u2019t necessarily break out individual industries by percentage, but in general we are not dramatically different than the overall economy, so that\u2019s one point.","The second point is when you look at our contract value growth, no matter how you slice it and dice it, even by industry, almost every industry sector has double-digit growth.  There\u2019s a couple that are high single digit, so we\u2019re very balanced.  Everything is growing nicely around the world, including financial services, including public sector.  So everything we look at from an industry perspective, I wouldn\u2019t point out pockets that are exceptionally strong and I don\u2019t need to point out pockets that are exceptionally weak, because everything is pretty well balanced, to be honest.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, great.  Can I just ask a quick follow-up to Peter Appert\u2019s line of questioning?  I think, Chris, you made a specific comment in your remarks \u2013 I think it was you, Chris \u2013 you said expecting continued CV acceleration over time.  I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding that properly \u2013 I mean, are you basically saying 2013, given the sales force growth, should be a year of acceleration, or are you trying to say it should accelerate from here?","Christopher Lafond","It\u2019s a great question.  Obviously we don\u2019t give contract value guidance, but what we\u2019ve talked about and what we continue to say is that we are adding sales capacity in the 15 to 20% range.  As Gene talked about, it takes some time for them to get up to speed.  As they get up to speed, we certainly expect that our growth will continue to accelerate over time.  So we didn\u2019t make any specific statements about it being in 2013 or certain periods of time because we don\u2019t give that guidance, but we certainly do expect continued growth and continued acceleration with the hiring we\u2019re doing.","Kelly Flynn \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and your next question comes from Dan Leben, Robert W. Baird.  Thank you.","Dan Leben \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Great, thanks.  Good morning.  Just a follow-up on the sales theme \u2013 help us think about what you\u2019re seeing now in terms of turnover levels, and how that needs to trend to stay in line with the (inaudible) guidance.","Eugene Hall","Hey, it\u2019s Gene.  So the turnover among our salespeople has been consistent for several years.  There\u2019s no material difference in turnover, even as the economy has in some places gotten hotter.  Our turnover has been very stable.  Gartner is a great place to work if you\u2019re a salesperson because we have a great brand name, we have this incredible market opportunity, and there\u2019s plenty of money-making opportunities for salespeople as well.  So if you\u2019re a salesperson, it\u2019s a great place to be.  We don\u2019t have any trouble retaining our salespeople.","Dan Leben \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Great.  And then when you\u2019re putting those people in the field, could you talk about any particular areas where you see more low-hanging fruit than others, either by vertical or geography?","Eugene Hall","You know, as Chris said earlier, our business pretty much reflects the GDP in each of the markets we\u2019re in, and we\u2019re in 85 countries.  We\u2019re in all size ranges of clients, either from the very largest companies in the world to very small companies, and as we\u2019ve added salespeople, we\u2019ve added them across all of the geographies, across all of the industries, across all size ranges.  There\u2019s kind of a practical operational reason for that, which is that as we grow our sales force in the 15 to 20% range and then we have normal turnover of that sales force, we have a lot of new people in the sales force.  If we grew one area at 50% and another at zero, the 50% growth area has even more new people in it and operationally it\u2019s just more difficult to manage.  So really, our strategy is to grow\u2014you know, we see low-hanging fruit across every industry, across every geography and every size range, so we\u2019re really growing our sales force across each of those.  And there may be specific operational reasons, like they\u2019re a little faster or a little slower in one of those, but in general it\u2019s pretty well distributed.","Dan Leben \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Great.  And then last one from me \u2013 utilization up to 70%.  How are you thinking about a target for that metric as you start to ramp up the hiring?  Is it somewhere in the low 70s where you want to measure that to?","Christopher Lafond","You know, as we\u2019ve talked about, Dan, over time, keeping to consistently around 70% has been our objective.  There are certainly opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy to maybe bring that up a bit, but we certainly target to stay at 70 and slightly above that, and if we can stay there we feel very comfortable that we can keep delivering on that 40% margin.  So ultimately, getting to 40% consistently requires us to stay around that 70% number consistently, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to drive to.","Dan Leben \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you, and your next question comes from Brian Karimzad, Goldman Sachs.  Thank you.","Brian Karimzad \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi.  I wonder if you guys can clarify a bit more the growth within verticals, geographies, and client sizes?  So when you reported last, you were fairly emphatic that every single one of the verticals, geographies and client sizes was growing research contract value double digits.  It sounds like a couple of the verticals has slipped down below that.  Can you give us color on whether the geographies and the client sizes, each of those within there, are all at double digits?  And then if a couple of the verticals slipped down below double digits, what accelerated to keep the total CV growth stable?","Christopher Lafond","Hey Brian, it\u2019s Chris.  What I would say is it\u2019s noise around the edges when we look at it; so as I said, we do have some things high single digit, we have some things that are certainly higher double digit.  So it\u2019s no different than usual.  Every time we look at our results, every quarter, there\u2019s things that move around a little bit plus or minus, so when we looked at the trend lines, we didn\u2019t see anything here that jumped out at us as worth kind of describing, either as a high or a low point.  So for us, we think it\u2019s trending exactly as we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters with extremely balanced, and I wouldn\u2019t say anything dramatically accelerated and nothing dramatically decelerated.  We feel very comfortable where everything is right now.","Brian Karimzad \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  And just out of curiosity, are those two verticals that were below double, were those financial and government, or was it something else?","Christopher Lafond","As I said, we\u2019re not going to go into the details of that, Brian.  I think at this point, as I said, we feel really comfortable there\u2019s no change in trend.  We feel really good about the balanced perspective we have, and there\u2019s nothing there that I think warrants highlighting.","Brian Karimzad \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  And then on the sales force turnover, it sounds like on an absolute basis you haven\u2019t seen anything change, but any difference in mix on the type of salesperson who is leaving, outperformers versus underperformers?","Christopher Lafond","No, absolutely not.  Again, we do track exactly who is leaving.  We do exit interviews with the vast majority as well to understand why they are leaving in detail, and we use that to feed that back into the organization for both recruiting and how we manage.  There\u2019s no change at all, basically, in terms of why people leave.","Brian Karimzad \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you, and that\u2019s all the time we have for Q&A.

A replay of this call will be available through December 6, 2014. The replay can be accessed by dialing (888) 286-8010 for domestic calls and (617) 801-6888 for international calls, and by entering the pass code 49062371.","This call is being simultaneously webcast and will be archived on Gartner's website at www.gartner.com for approximately 90 days.","I will now turn the conference over to Brian Shipman, Gartner's Group Vice President of Investor Relations, for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Shipman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. This call will include a discussion of Q3 2014 financial results, as disclosed in today's press release. After our prepared remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions. I would like to remind everyone that the press release is available on our website, and that URL is gartner.com.","Before we begin, we need to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I would encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. The company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward-looking statements.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Gartner's CEO, Gene Hall. Gene?","Eugene A. Hall","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q3 2014 earnings call.","Well, our business is accelerating. The continued successful execution of our proven strategy drove another strong quarter, with revenue growth at 15% on a reported basis.","We delivered robust performances across the business. Research, our largest and most profitable segment, grew at 14% FX-neutral, continuing our trend of double-digit contract value growth in every region across every client size in every industry segment.","For the third quarter of 2014, enterprise client retention was at 84%, up 1 point over the same quarter in 2013. Enterprise wallet retention was 105%, also up 1 point over Q3 2013.","Our Consulting business delivered a tremendous performance for the quarter. Consulting revenues increased 17% compared to Q3 2013, and the backlog was up 16% over the same period.","Our Events business also delivered a fantastic performance. As we told you in the past, our events can shift from 1 quarter to another, so it's often better to evaluate our results on a same-event basis. So for the 12 events we delivered in Q3, on a same-events basis, we drove a revenue increase of 18% year-over-year.","We continue to deploy our capital strategically. Year-to-date, we have repurchased more than $387 million of our shares, which is up $80 million over last quarter, and puts us very close to our overall target of $400 million for 2014.","Craig will give you more details on all of our business results in a moment.","I just returned from the largest of our flagship conference series, Symposium\/ITxpo, in Orlando, Florida. We achieved sold-out status for this event.","In addition, the caliber of our audience continues to improve. This year in Orlando, we hosted 2,700 CIOs. I met with a number of these CIOs and enterprise leaders from a diverse array of industries. These leaders are incredibly excited about the impact of IT on their enterprises and the critical role Gartner plays in achieving their enterprise's objectives.","I also had the opportunity to speak with a large number of our salespeople, some of whom have been to several Symposium events and some of whom, this was their first. Whether new or experienced, all of them had an incredible excitement and enthusiasm about the event, Gartner's brand and our market opportunity.","Our annual Symposium\/ITxpo conference series is composed of 8 events held in different locations around the globe: in addition to Orlando, we've already hosted the event in Dubai; Cape Town, South Africa; Goa, India; Tokyo, Japan; and Sao Paulo, Brazil. And over the next couple of weeks, we'll host the remaining 2 events in Barcelona, Spain; and the Gold Coast of Australia.","Gartner's Symposium\/ITxpo is an incredible demonstration of our value. We are the best source of help for enterprise leaders launching critical initiatives. It truly is the world's most important gathering of CIOs and senior IT executives. There's nothing else like it on the planet.","One of the primary reasons our Events business and our overall business have been so successful is our people. Gartner is a people business. Over the past several years, we've made significant investments in our people. We've invested in recruiting and in training. We've improved our customer service processes. In Consulting, we invested in our managing partner program. We invested heavily in improving sales productivity. And these investments are paying off. We're seeing improvements in sales productivity. Our Consulting business is delivering record-breaking results. We're attracting the best talent in the industry and getting them up to speed quickly.","The insights we create, the advice we deliver and the overall experience for our customers has never been better, and we're not slowing down. We'll continue to improve and innovate across every area of our business. We know how to be successful in any economic environment. We're relevant whether institution is growing or facing economic challenges.","We continue to deliver double-digit results in our key operating metrics due to the tremendous value we deliver to our clients.","I remain confident and excited about Gartner. The Gartner brand is in a class by itself. Our products, services and people are superior to the competition. We have a great business model, and we continue to be more relevant to virtually every enterprise in the world.","And with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Craig.","Craig Safian","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, Gartner continued its strong performance with double-digit growth in contract value and revenue, putting the company in a solid position to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth for the full year.","Year-over-year FX-neutral contract value growth accelerated from 13% to 14% in the quarter, and retention rates again ended at or near all-time highs. Our Events business increased revenues by 18% year-over-year on a same-event and FX-neutral basis. And finally, our Consulting business grew revenues by 17% on an FX-neutral basis for the third quarter on the strength of both our labor-based Consulting business and our Contract Optimization practice.","We continued to see robust demand for our services across all of our business segments in the third quarter and, as a result, are increasing our outlook for the full year.","Our business continues to grow at double-digit rates quarter after quarter, year-after-year. And this is why we continue to be excited about our prospects for future growth. Our products and services provide great value to the IT, supply chain and marketing professionals we work with. We are engaged on their most important initiatives and projects. Our strong and improving retention metrics demonstrate the value and importance of our products and services.","In both existing and prospect accounts, we are finding new IT, supply chain and marketing professionals to sell to every day. We are confident that we will continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance over the long term.","I'll now provide a review of our 3 business segments for the third quarter, and we will end with details of our revised outlook for the remainder of 2014 before taking your questions.","Starting with Research. Research revenue was up 15% on an as-reported and FX-neutral basis in the third quarter and grew 13% excluding the impact of acquisitions. The contribution margin for Research was 69% in the third quarter, very close to our gross contribution margin target of 70% for this segment. The other key Research business metrics also remained strong. Contract value grew to a record level of $1.486 billion, a growth rate of 12% year-over-year on a reported basis and 14% on an FX-neutral basis. Significantly, this reflects continued acceleration from the last few quarters when our FX-neutral contract value growth ranged between 12% and 13%.","As has been true over the past several years, our growth in contract value in Q3 was extremely broad-based, with every region, every client size, and every industry segment growing at double-digit rates.","We'll next cover retention rates and new business.","Our client retention rate at the enterprise level ended the quarter at 84%, up 1 point versus the same quarter last year, and we've maintained client retention at roughly 84% for the past 2 years. Wallet retention at the enterprise level ended at 105% in the third quarter, an uptick of 1 point over last year's third quarter.","Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retain a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we have discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a rolling 4-quarter basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","New business again increased nicely year-over-year. The new-business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. Our contract value growth also continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting.","We have increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year since 2005, and we will do so again during the current fourth quarter.","We also continue to see strong volume growth in our new business. This reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises. As a result, we ended the quarter with 9,279 client enterprises, up 9% over last year's third quarter. Additionally, our average spend per enterprise continues to increase, again, reflecting our ability to grow our contract value by driving growth in both new and existing enterprises.","I also want to spend a moment addressing sales productivity. We provide all the inputs so that you can calculate sales productivity on your own. Today, I thought I'd discuss this in more detail to ensure we are using a common language.","As we have detailed in the past, we look at sales productivity as the net contract value increase, what we call NCVI, per account executive.","We look at it on a rolling 4-quarter basis to eliminate seasonality and, as discussed at Investor Day, we use opening sales headcount as the period denominator. Over the last 12 months, we grew our contract value by $179 million in FX-neutral terms. Using our Q3 2013 ending sales headcount of 1,605 as our beginning-of-period denominator yields NCVI per AE of $111,000 on a rolling 4-quarter basis, up from where we ended 2013 and both Q1 and Q2 of 2014.","When we look at Q3 year-to-date or the stand-alone third quarter, you will see that our NCVI productivity per AE is up approximately 28% on both measures as compared to the prior year period.","To sum up, we delivered another strong quarter in our Research business. Contract value growth accelerated from 2013, as we expected. We continue to see strong demand from clients. Our retention rates remain at or near all-time highs, and we continue to expect acceleration and productivity, contract value and revenue growth over the long term.","Turning now to Events. For the quarter, our Events segment continued a 4-year trend of extremely strong year-over-year revenue growth on a same-event basis. On a reported basis, the fact that we had 4 fewer events in this year's third quarter affected the year-over-year comparison of our operating results. As you'll recall, this was reflected in our discussion around Q3 expectations on our last earnings call.","In the third quarter, Events revenue decreased 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and decreased 2% on an FX-neutral basis. During the third quarter, we held 12 events with 5,606 attendees compared to 16 events with 6,353 attendees in the third quarter of 2013. On a same-event and FX-neutral basis, Events revenue was up 18% year-over-year in the third quarter.","The gross contribution margin for Events of 30% for Q3 was unchanged from the third quarter a year ago, despite the move of 4 events out of this year's third quarter.","Q4 is typically our largest Events revenue quarter, and 2014 is no different.","You will hear later that we have increased our outlook for the Events business, and this is largely driven by the strength we are seeing across our global Symposium series of events. Symposium is our event series for CIOs, and our performance this year is exceeding our initial expectations.","We have now held all but 2 of our 2014 global Symposia series, and as Gene mentioned, the remaining 2 are happening over the next 2 weeks.","In each of the Symposia that have occurred, we have seen healthy growth in attendees. But even more importantly, we've been able to grow the number of CIO attendees at these events at an even greater pace. We'll provide much more color on our next quarterly earnings call once all these events have been completed and when the numbers are finalized.","Moving on to Consulting. Revenues in Consulting increased 17% on both the reported and FX-neutral basis in the third quarter. We showed strength across the entire business with our labor-based business recording 13% revenue growth in the quarter. On the labor-based side, billable headcount of 534 was up 4% from the third quarter of 2013. Third quarter utilization was 65%, a 7-point improvement over the third quarter of last year, and annualized revenue per billable headcount ended the quarter at $423,000, a 13% improvement over Q3 of last year.","As we have discussed in the past, our Contract Optimization practice has more variability than the other parts of our Consulting business. The third quarter continued the strength we saw in the first half, and we now expect the full year results to be stronger than prior years in this part of our Consulting business.","Across the entire Consulting business, we continue to see strong demand for our services, and our strategy of investing in managing partners is allowing us to capture that demand. We now have 86 managing partners, an increase of 8% from a year ago.","Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $112 million. This represents 16% growth year-over-year and a healthy 4 months of backlog. With the current backlog and visibility we have into the pipeline, the Consulting business is positioned to continue to deliver solid results for 2014.","Moving down the income statement. SG&A increased by $35 million year-over-year during the third quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force. As of September 30, we had 1,820 quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 215 or 13% from a year ago. For the full year, we expect to grow the sales force by roughly 15%.","In the third quarter, SG&A was higher as a percentage of revenues due to Q3 being one of our seasonally smaller quarters, the move of events out of the quarter in the Events segment as well as continued investments in our recruiting and training capabilities. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A trends are more in line with what we have experienced historically.","Moving now to earnings. Normalized EBITDA was $75 million in the third quarter, essentially flat with last year's third quarter, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, down 5% year-over-year. Our Q3 2014 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes $0.06 in amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions. Excluding acquisition-related charges, our normalized EPS grew 7% to $0.44 in the third quarter.","Our third quarter earnings reflect seasonality and the move of 4 events that I just mentioned a moment ago.","Turning now to cash. Operating cash flow increased by 14% to $276 million during the first 9 months of 2014 compared with the same period a year ago. During the third quarter, we continued to utilize our cash to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. In the quarter, we repurchased over 1.1 million shares and we used approximately $82 million of cash for share repurchases. As of September 30, we had $454 million remaining on our $800 million authorization.","We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position, despite the more aggressive pace of share repurchases and the acquisitions we've done through Q3.","As of September 30, we had debt of $370 million and cash of $341 million, with 95% of our cash balance located outside of the U.S..","Our credit facility runs through March 2018, and at this time, provides us with about $367 million of remaining borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive shareholder value. We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We also continue to believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital. Absent other significant opportunities to deploy cash, we now expect to repurchase greater than $400 million of our own shares this year.","Turning now to guidance. Based upon our year-to-date results, our outlook for Q4 and current foreign exchange rates, we are increasing our outlook and also tightening the ranges of our previously issued guidance. As you know, our normal business trends do show seasonality. Our fourth quarter is typically our largest events quarter, a large Consulting quarter and our largest contract value growth quarter.","All the figures I'm going to give you are contained in our press release, but I did want to highlight a number of the upward adjustments we've made to our 2014 outlook.","We have increased the top end of our total revenue guidance by $25 million and the bottom end by $45 million. This makes our new total revenue range for 2014, $2.005 billion to $2.030 billion. This range represents 12% to 14% total revenue growth versus 2013.","The new range for Research revenue reflects an increase to the top end of guidance of $5 million, and an increase to the bottom end of $15 million. The new Research revenue range is $1.45 billion to $1.46 billion or 14% to 15% growth. The upward revisions reflect the acceleration of the growth rate for contract value this year.","For Events segment revenue in 2014, we are raising the bottom end by $10 million to $220 million and the top end by $5 million to $225 million. This new range yields 11% to 13% growth. The updated outlook for Events is supported by our year-to-date performance as well as the positive view on our Q4 events, most notably, our Symposium series that was discussed earlier.","Finally, for Consulting segment revenue in 2014, we are raising the bottom end by $20 million and the top end by $15 million. The new range in Consulting segment revenues we expect for 2014 is $335 million to $345 million or 7% to 10% growth for the full year.","Given the strength and demand across all of our businesses, we are also raising our earnings guidance. Specifically, for normalized EBITDA at 2014, we are raising the bottom end of our guidance by $10 million. This makes the new range for normalized EBITDA $385 million to $400 million or 11% to 16% annual growth. We also expect free cash flow to be higher by $5 million on the lower end. The details around the components of free cash flow are in our press release.","For adjusted EPS in 2014, we have raised the bottom end of guidance by $0.08 per share. Our new guidance range is $2.26 to $2.35 per share. This yields 15% to 19% year-over-year growth.","We still expect full year acquisition and integration charges of approximately $30 million. Thus, our full year GAAP EPS guidance has increased to $2.05 to $2.14 per share, which also reflects our improved outlook.","Please note that GAAP EPS is approximately $0.21 lower than normalized EPS for the full year due to acquisition-related charges.","We also now expect that on December 31, 2014, we will have fewer than 89 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For the full year, the weighted average fully diluted share count will be approximately 91.5 million shares. Given the increased full year EPS guidance, the implied range for our fourth quarter guidance for normalized EPS is now $0.74 to $0.83 per share.","Before wrapping up, I wanted to take a moment to discuss foreign exchange and the impact of currency fluctuation on our results. We are a global company with both revenues and expenses denominated in many currencies outside of the U.S. dollar. Our mix of revenues and expenses are roughly matched by currency around the world, creating a natural hedge from our earnings perspective. Currency fluctuations have a much lesser impact in dollar terms on earnings than they do on reported revenues.","We provide transparency for our investors by providing both reported and FX-neutral results on most of our key measures.","As you have seen recently, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against some key currencies. This happened over the back half of the third quarter and actually accelerated during October. We've reflected these impacts into our guidance utilizing recent exchange rates. These recent exchange rates had a modest negative impact on our outlook for reported revenues, and are reflected in the guidance range as we just discussed. So before taking your questions, let me summarize.","We delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Demand for our services is robust. And as a result, our research contract value growth rate accelerated, and we generated double-digit total revenue growth.","Our key business metrics remain strong and in fact, many, most notably retention, CV growth and sales productivity, improved in the third quarter. Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with a positive operating leverage inherent in our businesses, delivered solid earnings and cash flow growth for the first 9 months of the year.","And we continue to actively explore strategic alternatives for deploying our cash. Going forward, we will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisitions and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program.","Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in the third quarter of 2014, we remain well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and earnings growth for the full year 2014.","Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Okay. Your first question comes from Jeff Meuler from R.W. Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. I hate to be the [indiscernible] that does this, but it's too warm [ph] to not to. Gene, the acceleration that you guys are seeing, could you just talk about how broad-based it is? How much of this is kind of anniversary-ing the pockets of weakness that you saw a year ago? Or just anything you could say on the breadth of the acceleration.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, Jeff, great question. So the -- what we've seen is an acceleration that is broad around the world. As I mentioned before, double-digit growth in every geography, every industry. And so it's really very broad-based. You have a good point. There is a -- at this time last year, we had some areas that were performing below our expectations, and so the -- we do have that comparison point.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then you guys, it sounds like, you're seeing the list in sales force productivity following the changes that you made. And I think, the headcount was only up 13% year-over-year this quarter. How are you thinking about sales force headcount planning heading into '15?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. So our sales force headcount planning remains the same as it has been in the past, which is we're planning to grow our sales headcount 15% to 20% a year consistently.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","But I guess, you slowed it down towards the lower end of the range, I don't know, 18, 24 months ago because you were seeing productivity come down. Now we're seeing productivity come up. So should we more be thinking about accelerating the headcount growth towards the top end of the range?","Eugene A. Hall","Again, as Craig said, so for this year, we're expecting approximately 15% headcount growth. Next year, we haven't given a specific guidance for next year, but again, our long-term target is 15% to 20% a year. I wouldn't take the kind of 13% for this quarter as anything meaningful other than just kind of noise. As an example, we train people in classes. And so if 1 class falls in 1 quarter and not another quarter, that can be enough to even swing that. And so I would take it at -- the 13% in this particular quarter, as just noise as opposed to indicative of something else.","Operator","Okay. Next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Matthew Hill","This is Matt Hill in for Tim McHugh. My first question on the Consulting line, seeing broad-based growth across all the different practice areas, can you give an idea of the ranges? How tightly you're seeing the growth between them? Is there one that's really driving results there? And then, noticing the improvement in that space, could we -- in utilization and the productivity of the consultants, is there any area to increase headcount growth there as well?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. So I love -- I'll do the second question first, which is that as we grow our business, there is an opportunity to grow the headcount growth. With the backlog up at such a -- the kind of double-digit rates it's up, I think it will lead to headcount growth, so we can deliver all the stuff we're selling. And we see robust demand continuing.","Craig Safian","Yes. Matt, the only other thing I'd add is, as Gene mentioned, with the backlog growth we're seeing, we're seeing improvements in our efficiency metrics, utilization, bill rate, annualized revenue per billable. It really all goes back strategically to our investment in the managing partners. And with the end game being, we've got professional sellers and deliverers of our Consulting business oriented by vertical industry. We've seen growth across all of the industries, but their ability to generate large recurring relationships will allow us to drive better efficiency metrics and also increase headcount over time as the backlog increases.","Matthew Hill","Okay, great. And then on the Contract Optimization piece, I think in the past, we'd spoke about maybe some of that work pulling forward into the first half of the year and maybe down in the second half. So -- but it sounds like that continued into the third quarter. Just expectations in the fourth quarter, and if there is enough work out there that it keeps filling in whatever you think got pulled forward.","Craig Safian","Yes. The strength in that business has continued. And we expect it to stick now, which is one of the reasons why we raised the full year outlook for the Consulting business. But the other thing worth noting is that the labor-based business, as I mentioned earlier, was up 13% year-over-year in the quarter. We continue to see great strength in that business as well. So it's a combination of upside on the Contract Optimization business, but also some real nice strength in the labor-based business. And the other thing worth mentioning is, we had a very strong Q4 last year. So it's a little bit of a tough comp on a year-over-year basis. But I would focus in on the 7% to 10% full year growth that we're now projecting for that segment.","Matthew Hill","Okay, great. And then just one kind of quick numbers one, I think, modest impact from currency. Is there any -- do you want to give a number around that at all on the guidance, what you're seeing there?","Craig Safian","It's order of magnitude, less than 1% of total revenues based on what we are seeing today from an exchange rate perspective. Obviously, if the dollar continues to strengthen, that will change. But it's not an enormous impact versus our original planning assumptions.","Operator","Next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Janney.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, on the Research side, we're getting closer to that 70% margin target. Can you give us an update on where -- how high you think that margin can go? And maybe some idea on the trajectory from here going forward.","Craig Safian","So what we've said in the past, and actually, the way we manage our business is we expect a 70% margin in that business over the long term. We feel that to continue to deliver great service and great value to our clients and drive the kind of retention rates that we're driving, we need to continue to invest in that business to make sure we've got the right analyst covering the right topics, the right service people interacting with the clients at the right time, et cetera. So from a modeling perspective, our expectation is 70%, and then ride at that level into the future. The one thing worth mentioning, though, is as Research today is the biggest part of our business and is growing at the fastest pace, Research will continue to be a bigger and bigger piece of the overall Gartner pie. And that will drive gross margin leverage for us even if we flatten out at the 70% incremental margin on Research.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then on the Consulting side, was there any lumpy projects in there? And should we consider that to be a sustainable uptick? I'm just wondering whether demand picked up or what was driving that, including the backlog?","Eugene A. Hall","Joe, it was not lumpy projects. Basically, it was sort of broad-based demand with the same kind of projects that you see normally, which are not lumpy at all, actually. And as Craig mentioned, and as we've talked about before, we've had a strategy of adding management partners over the last several years. And we think the addition of those management partners is what's driving the fundamental growth in that business.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the last one for me. Sales productivity also seemed to take a significant uptick here. How should we think about that versus the hiring in that business? Is this is a new level? Or will it fluctuate and then step up gradually over time?","Craig Safian","So on the sales productivity side, on a rolling 4-quarter basis, it's a modest improvement. As I mentioned earlier, if you look at a Q3 year-to-date or Q3 stand-alone, it was obviously a much more significant improvement. But Q4 is a very large quarter for us. And so rolling 4-quarters is probably the best way to look at it. So we're pleased and we expect it to see modest improvement. If you go back and do the math, we've achieved higher levels of productivity in the past, and it is our goal to, over time, get back to those levels. So I wouldn't expect to see any big jumps in sales productivity, but we're focused on driving continued and consistent improvements to that metric.","Operator","Next question comes from Anj Singh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, first, a little bit again on the Research consulting -- Research contribution margins. I know you guys speak to the 70% long-term target, but the contribution margin this quarter was down, the lowest that we've probably seen in 4 or 5 quarters. I'm wondering if you can sort of discuss the investments that might be driving that towards the lower end of your long-term guidance?","Craig Safian","Anj, good question. The way we've looked at it is things can bump around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. And so if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, it's a little bit of different story. Again, our expectation for the full year also is to be in between 69% and 70% on the gross margin. So while it looks a little wonky in the stand-alone quarter, I think trend-wise, rolling 4-quarter, Q3 year-to-date, it all looks pretty solid.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then, on your Events business, it looked rather strong despite having 4 less events year-over-year. I think you mentioned 18% up on a same-events basis. I'm wondering if you can help us understand the dynamics behind that trend, and if you can sort of discuss what sort of pricing increases you're seeing in your Events business.","Craig Safian","Sure. So I'll start with the price increase. As we continue to drive demand at these Events, we're able to take up prices, and we've done that consistently over the last few years. I mean, nothing dramatic but we've been able to increase prices both on the attendees' side and the exhibitors' side, which obviously helps us from a flow-through perspective. In terms of demand, I think it comes back to people getting great value or continuing to get great value out of Gartner Research. And the Events business is really just an extension of that. And whatever the topic is or whatever role the individual is in, in an IT organization, they continue to get huge value out of carving out a few days to go to our events. And so we don't expect that to stop. We expect that to continue. It's, again, why we're so focused on making sure that we make the right investments in our research business to make sure that our content and our intellectual property is consistently top notch. But because of that top-notch content, that's what drives the attendees to the events.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And one final one for me. Can you discuss what the trends and retention rates look like for your sales force? Is that playing into your hiring patterns or the slight dip in the headcount increase seen this quarter?","Eugene A. Hall","So it's Gene. The trends in our retention of our salespeople is that it's been in the same trend we've had all year, which is better than last year. And we have very good retention of our salespeople, and it has continued to get even better despite the fact that the job market overall in, certainly, some of the markets is heating up.","Operator","Next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is the Ryan filling in for Manav. Just want to talk about, I guess, a little bit, you mentioned a tough year-over-year comp in Consulting. I mean, it's still a pretty -- just given the backlog and the strong growth, still represents a decent deceleration at the midpoint of your guidance. It's just -- is there anything in there that we should be thinking about? Is that a level of conservatism? Just trying to get some color around that.","Craig Safian","It's a good question, Ryan. I think it's primarily driven around -- and I hate to keep talking about Contract Optimization, but tough compare last year on Contract Optimization, so a little bit of a decline in that business, but we expect to see continued strength on the labor-based business. And it all -- it still looks good, it still looks in trend. You're right, at the midpoint of the guidance, it's declined. At the high end, it's roughly flattish. There's a little bit of foreign exchange in there as well that you have to account for. But the primary driver is an expectation of slightly lower Contract Optimization business off a tough compare from Q4 of 2013.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of repurchases, I mean, I know obviously, the -- it's been pretty strong year-to-date. Is that something we should see -- again, a deceleration just based off kind of the total year number? Is the year-to-date trend probably a good gauge for that?","Craig Safian","From a repurchase perspective, we're still sticking to $800 million over the 2-year period. We're obviously close to $400 million through the end of the third quarter. What we said earlier is we'll do more than $400 million this year. And so I think the expectation should still be looked at over a 2-year period.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And just any comment you have on kind of M&A environment. We're obviously seeing more robust demand. Is there anything that you see? Has your pipeline kind of changed? Are there more in there? And how is kind of pricing in that environment?","Eugene A. Hall","So we have -- there's no change. We have a robust pipeline, a lot of very interesting potential candidates. It's the same as it has been, really, over a period of years. So no change to pipeline for acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I know that the Symposium in Orlando recently, you've said, was sold out. And I guess, I just wanted to inquire about the rest of that series, given that, that's been an awful lot of the growth in the Events business. If we think about some of these big events being sold out, should we think about that slowing the trajectory of the Events business as we move forward over the next couple of years? Or is there enough room to grow the other ones and to add more into the portfolio such that this would continue to be a growth engine for the business?","Eugene A. Hall","You shouldn't think about that as slowing the growth of our Events business at all. First, we'll continue to add other events. Secondly, even within those events we talked about earlier, where we have capacity limits, we're actually changing the events so that we can get higher prices based on who's going to those events. So we've got kind of a price increase, and the price is not just pure increased pricing, but actually targeting people who get more value and can pay more for those events, combined with adding more events as well. And so you shouldn't think about our Events business growth slowing at all.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just to add one more on Consulting. Should we think about this business now, outside of the fluctuations in Contract Optimization, maybe having better growth prospects than the pretty modest long-term rate you've talked about historically? And just anything else you can say on the demand increases? Is it that the managing partner strategy leads to more ongoing business because they're more of a relationship role? Or is there something changed about how customers are finding value from Gartner's Consulting business?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. So we've had 2 strategies in our Consulting business that have really driven this growth that we've been working on over a period of years. One is to add managing partners, as we talked about. So we have the people that are leading engagements, actually selling the engagements, which is terrific. The second one, which is very important, is to align our Consulting services with what's going on in our Research business, and the key priority is that our Research clients see. And those 2 things are basically driving additional demand for the business. And we see that demand to continue to be sustained over a period of time. Because of those 2 things -- it's not kind of a onetime thing. It's systematic things we've put into place over a period of time that has fundamentally driven increased demand.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 quick ones. Your comment on the FX, I think that was a full year comment. If we sort of backed into it and assumed the rates stayed, it seems to me, it's a 2%-or-so headwind in the fourth quarter and into next year. Is that the right ballpark? And then the second question, just I think, you said 95% of the cash is outside the U.S. What's the long-term strategy to reinvest that cash?","Craig Safian","Sure. So first on the FX. You're right. The comments we made were largely centered around the fourth quarter. And again, this can be a little confusing because we have an expectation when we go into the year, which may be different than what we actually experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. And so we generally are marking up or marking down from that original expectation. Again, when we looked at FX rates, compared to our original expectation, it looked to be about a 1.5% impact on total revenues. And that would potentially, as exchange rates hold where they are, roll into next year. As we talked about, we do have a natural hedge. So we do have our expenses and revenues roughly matched around the world. And so it'll have a more muted impact from a dollar perspective on earnings. On the overseas cash, we continue to invest pretty heavily in our business. We're growing just about everywhere, U.S. and outside of the U.S., and a nice portion of our M&A pipeline also exists outside of the U.S. And so as we look for uses of cash or deployment of that cash, those are the 2 primary things we look at. The reason why we've got debt on our balance sheet is because we've been aggressively repurchasing shares back here in the U.S., and that has allowed us to build up the debt balance on our balance sheet.","Operator","Next question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.","John D. Crowther - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, you've got John Crowther on for Peter. I just have a couple of real quick questions here. I'll do all them altogether. One, you talked about the margins in the Research business and how that mix shift of that faster-growing business is going to continue to drive leverage on the COGS line going forward. Wondered if you could just comment about leverage opportunities on the SG&A line as well. Second, taxes, a nice little benefit in this quarter, but full year sort of tracking, I would say, in line with where it's been usual. I understand some volatility there, but just want to know if there's anything we should be thinking about that going forward? And then lastly, on FX, obviously you've addressed it a couple of times here, but to your point on natural hedging, just wanted to understand. Is sort of the flow-through impact pretty similar to sort of your full-end margins in terms of how your EPS would be impacted versus revenue?","Craig Safian","Great, great. So I'll start at the top. So first question was on leverage beyond the gross margin line. So 2 comments there. One is we've consistently gotten great leverage out of our G&A cost. As a percentage of revenue, they have come down consistently year-after-year. And that's why we are investing in lots of areas. We're a bigger company with more people. We've scaled up our recruiting capability and things like that. But even with all of that, we've continued to get nice leverage out of the G&A portion of SG&A. On the S side, the reason why we're so focused on sales productivity is as we drive sales productivity up, we can start to get potentially leverage from that line as well. That's more of a long-term view. But as you model out into the future, we'll get leverage on the gross margin line, just based on the pure economics of our business, we'll get leverage on G&A. And as we improve sales productivity, we'll start to look -- level off and then potentially get leverage there.","On the tax comment, we did have a onetime adjustment this quarter related to the use of foreign tax credits. It had a big impact on the quarter because it's a small earnings quarter. So call it a roughly $0.02 impact on EPS for the quarter. For a full year perspective, we're still expecting around 32.5% rate. And again, the reason why it was so big is just because the adjustment happened on a small earnings quarter. And then lastly, your question on FX and flow-through. Yes. So what the natural hedge implies is that whatever impact we have on revenue roughly flows through at our operating margin.","Operator","Okay. Next question comes from Bill Bird from FBR Capital.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So just a follow-up on SG&A. So for Q4, are you expecting to see some moderation in SG&A growth?","Craig Safian","So I think on a full year basis, we'd expect to see what we've historically seen, which is for the full year, SG&A as a percentage of revenue will increase slightly over what we saw from 2013.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then for Events, I was wondering if you could speak to what you are seeing in advanced bookings for exhibitors and attendees.","Eugene A. Hall","So advanced bookings for Events have been strong across the board. The kind of growth we talked about for the Q3 events, we're seeing great strength in our advanced bookings as well.","Craig Safian","And Bill, if you look at -- the reason we raised our guidance on the Events is because of our confidence around the advanced bookings and advanced registrations at the Events in fourth quarter that have happened and will happen.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Great. And just one final question. I'm curious why the free cash flow guidance was unchanged, while the earnings guidance range moved up.","Craig Safian","We actually -- we took the bottom end of the free cash flow up by $5 million.","Operator","Next question comes from Jerry Herman from Stifel.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Gene, I just wanted to revisit the sales force question again. I know you guys have talked about this 15% to 20% target. The third quarter was below that and you recognized that as noise. I'm just wondering in light of the tougher, let's call it, employment environment, the job growth getting stronger and also, the law of large numbers getting more challenging, is that -- is it really realistic to drive towards 20%? Or should we really think about the lower end of that range?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, Jerry, great question. Gartner is a fabulous place for salespeople to be at. If -- selling in technology is a great place to be. If you are selling technology, Gartner's kind of the best place even within that. So it is an incredibly attractive place for sales people. And you see that in the fact that we have low turnover among our sales force. So with any kind of sales force like we have, if you benchmark it, we have quite low turnover. And as I mentioned, despite the job arc getting worse in terms of hotter, our turnover actually has gotten better. In terms of recruiting, because it's such an attractive place to be, we don't have a problem recruiting with people at all. If you look at the numbers of people we need to hire each year, it is just tiny compared to the total market out there. And as I said, we're a tremendously attractive place to be for salespeople. So we don't see any limits in terms of the market. The real limits are our ability to have the right kind of recruiting, training, et cetera, as opposed to market. And we think we've got that capability for the 15% to 20% range, both now and going forward.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And Craig, I just want to revisit the currency question again. I know it's sort of the topic of the day. But if currency rates remained unchanged as they are right now, could you estimate the impact in next year? Would it be in sort of that 1.5%, 2% range?","Craig Safian","Yes. I think that it's -- the last time we ran the calc, it was around 1.5%.","Operator","Next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets Canada","It's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. I was wondering if you could touch upon in -- on the double-digit growth rates by vertical. Are you seeing any acceleration in certain verticals? And maybe touch upon the overall macro environment. Are you seeing any acceleration or slowdown in the overall economy?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. Again, so we have seen great double-digit growth across all of our -- as I mentioned, all of our size clients, all of our industry segments and all of our geographic segments. And it's very broad-based demand. In terms of the macroeconomic environment, I think, no change.","Operator","Next question comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I know it's small, but I was just wondering whether you could talk a little bit about Software Advice. We haven't heard about it in a while. I think I heard that it contributed 2% to Research growth during the quarter, so that's about $6 million. I don't know if you have any updated thoughts on the growth opportunity at the very-small-company end of the market, both organically or via M&A?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. So I think small end of the market -- as we've talked about, Software Advice serves companies that are smaller than the companies that our traditional IT business has served. And we believe that there is tens of millions of those companies that are in the Software Advice sweet spot. And so we see that as being a great growth opportunity for us going forward because that's just an -- that's an enormous market we've not tapped in. And Software Advice has been meeting our expectations. It's been doing just terrifically well.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Brian Shipman","Thanks, everyone, and we're here today.

With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond. This call will include a discussion of Q3 2013 financial results as disclosed in today's press release. After our prepared remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions.

Hall","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of 2013, with another quarter of double-digit growth in contract value and our key financial metrics. Our business is performing well, and our results demonstrate continued effective execution of our proven strategy.","Research, our largest and most profitable segment, continues to deliver double-digit growth. We have robust demand for our services across all regions, industries and client sizes. We had 12% contract value growth during Q3, with few challenges in very specific areas, which moderately impacted our overall contract value growth rate. Chris will show more details in a moment. We understand where these issues are and we're making changes to address them, which we will expect will accelerate our contract value growth rate. Even with these challenges, we again achieved double-digit growth in every region, in every client size and in virtually every industry, including the public sector.","Our Events segment had another terrific quarter and continues to achieve strong double-digit growth in revenues, attendees and exhibitors at our events around the world. And our Consulting segment remains on track to deliver within the guidance we gave you last quarter.","I just returned from 2 of our Symposium ITxpo events, one in Orlando, Florida; and the other in Australia. Symposium ITxpo is our flagship conference series, and we host 8 of these conferences each year in different locations around the globe. Across all of these events, we're seeing record-level attendance and revenues. Symposium ITxpo is the world's most important gathering of CIOs and senior IT executives. There's nothing else like it on the planet.","In Orlando, which is the largest of this series, we hosted nearly 2,700 CIOs, and that's up more than 17% over last year. While in Orlando, I met with a number of CIOs and enterprise leaders from our diverse array of industries: manufacturing, retail and banking and financial services, even technology clients. These leaders are incredibly excited about the impact of IT on their enterprises and the critical role Gartner plays in achieving their enterprises' objectives. I also had the opportunity to speak with a large number of our salespeople at these events, and they're incredibly enthusiastic about the Gartner brand and market opportunity, as much so as I have ever seen them.","Gartner is the best source of help for enterprise leaders watching critical initiatives within the technology revolution. We know how to be successful in any economic environment, and we're relevant whether an institution is growing or facing economic challenges. We continue to deliver double-digit results to our key operating metrics through the tremendous value we deliver to our clients.","I remain confident in and excited about Gartner. The Gartner brand is in a class by itself. Our products, services and people are superior to the competition. We have a great business model and we're relevant to virtually every company and government agency in the world.","And with that, I'd like to hand the call to Chris.","Christopher J. Lafond","Thanks, Gene. And good morning, everyone.","During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategy to deliver consistent double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, earnings and cash flow over the long term. This growth was led by capturing more of the significant market opportunity that remains for our Research business. We continued to see strong trends in our key business metrics, and demand for our services remained solid across our 3 business segments. Even if companies face the uncertainties of the current economic environment, our business continues to grow at double-digit rates quarter after quarter, and this is because our products and services provide great value to the IT and supply chain professionals we work with. We're engaged in our most important initiatives and projects. And this is why we continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance over the long term.","Let me now review each of our 3 business segments for the third quarter, starting with Research. Research revenue was up 11% to $317 million on an as-reported basis in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Research revenues grew 12% compared to the prior year. The contribution margin in this segment increased 147 basis points to 69.6% in the third quarter, as we once again capitalized on the operating leverage of this business.","All of our key Research business metrics remained strong in the third quarter. Contract value grew to a record level of $1,327,000,000, a growth rate of 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and 12% on an FX neutral basis. As it's been the case for the past several years, our growth in contract value in Q3 was extremely broad based, with every region and client size growing at double-digit rates and almost every industry segment, including the public sector globally, also grew at double-digit rates.","New business, again, increased year-over-year, and the new business mix was balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. While our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline in annual price increases and no discounting, approximately 80% of our contract value growth came from volume, with the balance from price increases. We've consistently increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year on an annual basis since 2005. We recently implemented a price increase during the fourth quarter of 2013 and we expect to do so again next year.","Our volume growth reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients. As a result, we ended the quarter with 13,422 client organizations, up 6% over last year's third quarter. Our client retention rate ended the quarter at 82%, and we've maintained client retentions between 82% and 83% for 13 straight quarters. In addition to retaining our research clients at an impressive rate, the clients we retain continue to increase their spending with Gartner, and wallet retention ended at 97% in the third quarter.","Wallet retention is higher than client retention, due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we've discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a 4-quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality. It's important to note that both client and wallet retention rates remained at the same levels we reported in Q2. On a stand-alone quarter basis, wallet retention improved by approximately 2 points in Q3, as compared to Q2. As we mentioned last quarter, we expected our retention rates to remain at these high levels despite a few challenging pockets in Europe and in the public sector.","Let me spend a moment providing some additional color on these few challenging areas. It should not surprise you that a few governments around the world, including the U.S. Federal Government, modestly affected our overall growth. Nor should it surprise you that Europe remains a difficult selling environment and is growing slower on average in the rest of our businesses around the world. For example, our business in France, low to single-digit growth due primarily to some internal operational challenges that we're addressing. Despite these few challenging areas, our Research business remained strong, with double-digit contract value growth in every major geography, client size and almost every industry during Q3. In fact, excluding the U.S. Federal Government business, the rest of the Americas grew contract value by 15% year-over-year, which is an acceleration from Q2. On a global basis, excluding a couple governments in our business in France, global contract value grew by 14%.","As we discussed during our last call, contract value growth in 2013 has been impacted by these few challenging areas. With our continued strong performance in almost every part of the Research business, we're confident that we will see acceleration on our overall growth rate in contract value as these pockets recover.","And then on a final note with Research, I'd like to touch on sales productivity, which remains one of our focus areas. As with contract value in the third quarter, sales productivity has been pressured by the specific challenges I just mentioned. Most of our sales teams in regions continue to perform very well, with productivity flat to increasing. As we've talked about in the past, we also continue to make operational improvements to improve our overall sales productivity regardless of the economic environments where we operate. We fully expect to see increasing sales productivity over time.","In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in our Research segment. We grew contract value by $145 million on an FX neutral basis year-over-year. We continue to see strong demand from clients and we continue to expect acceleration in contract value and revenue growth. We remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit annual revenue growth in this business over the long term.","Turning now to Events. Our Events segment continued the trend of extremely strong year-over-year revenue growth that we've delivered for the past 3 years. In the third quarter, Events revenue increased 29% year-over-year on a reported basis and 31% on an FX neutral basis.","During the third quarter, we held 16 events with 6,353 attendees compared to 14 events with 5,566 attendees in the third quarter of 2012. On a same-events basis, Events revenue was up 10% year-over-year.","Gross contribution margin of 30% for Q3 increased roughly 6 percentage points from the third quarter a year ago. Looking ahead, we see strong demand for both attendee and exhibitor participation during our largest events quarter of the year. For the past few weeks, we've held 6 of our symposium events around the world, and next week, we'll hold our final of the year in Barcelona. Some of you attended our symposium ITxpo in Orlando last month and saw firsthand the strength of this series of events. Our Events business remains solidly on track to deliver another strong the year.","Moving on to Consulting. Revenues in Consulting declined 2% on a reported basis in the third quarter and declined 1% on an FX neutral basis. Our strategy continues to be to focus our Consulting services on a select group of our largest clients who request our differentiated benchmarking, Contract Optimization and other strategic services. While our Consulting business has also been impacted by the global public sector challenges this year, on a year-to-date basis, revenues are up 3% FX neutral in this segment. And we remain on track to deliver in the range of our full year revenue guidance.","Billable headcount of 516 was up 3% from the third quarter of 2012. Third quarter utilization was 58%, and revenue per billable headcount ended the quarter at $374,000.","Most important, for the remainder of the year, we're seeing steady demand for our Consulting services. Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $96.5 million. This represents 3% growth over the prior quarter and a healthy 4 months of backlog, which is our target for this business. Additionally, our pipeline is solid as we enter the final quarter of the year. With the current backlog and visibility we have into the pipeline, the Consulting business is positioned to deliver results in line with our long-term objectives.","Now moving down the income statement. SG&A increased by $16 million year-over-year during the third quarter, primarily driven by growth in our sales force. As of September 30, we had 1,605 quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 208 sales associates from a year ago. We continue to tightly control G&A costs across the entire company. We believe this expense item will provide us with a source of operating leverage in the future, as G&A will continue to decline as a percentage of revenue.","Moving on to earnings. We delivered another quarter of solid earnings growth, with normalized EBITDA at $75 million in the third quarter, up 10% year-over-year. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.40, up 21% year-over-year. As expected, our Q3 2013 GAAP diluted earnings per share included $0.01 per share in amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions, including Ideas International.","Turning to cash. Year-to-date operating cash flow increased by 16% to $242 million over the same period in 2012. We continue to expect the same level of free cash flow for the year that we indicated in our previously issued guidance. Over the long term, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow substantially greater than our net income given our tight cash management and the negative working capital characteristics of our Research business.","During the third quarter, we utilized our cash to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We repurchased over 1 million shares at a total cost of approximately $59 million. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position, with net cash of $170 million.","Our credit facility runs through March 2018 and, at this time, provides us with about $550 million of remaining borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value. We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital, and we have $84 million remaining under our board authorization.","Now let me turn to our business outlook for the remainder of 2013. With our Q3 results in line with our overall expectations, there are no changes to the guidance we discussed on our Second Quarter Conference Call. And as always, the details of that guidance are contained in today's press release.","So to summarize. We delivered another strong quarter of great results. Demand for our services is solid, and as a result, we generated double-digit revenue growth and our key business metrics remained strong in the third quarter. Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with the positive operating leverage inherent in our business, delivered solid earnings growth, and we generated substantial cash flow. As always, we are actively exploring strategic alternatives for deploying our cash. We will continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We expect to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of 2013 and beyond.","Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in the third quarter, we've built a solid foundation for delivering strong revenue and earnings growth for the remainder of 2013. We're well positioned for double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing returns to our shareholders over the long term.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Capital Markets.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes, I wonder if you could talk about how you're feeling about sales productivity at this point, and your out forecast or how many sales people you plan on hiring before the end of the year.","Christopher J. Lafond","Joe, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. So the first up, I'll answer the second one first. We have been guiding, as always, in the 15% to 20% range. This year, we'd said we'd be around 15%. We're trending to that, and that's where we would expect to end the year. So about 15% growth in our sales force. With regard to sales productivity, as I mentioned, we're actually seeing some really good results in the vast majority of our sales force. In fact, we're seeing some incremental improvements in certain pockets. We've seen a number of things stay relatively flat. And as I mentioned, there's a few places that we're seeing pressure that are causing us some challenges from a sales productivity perspective, so as I mentioned, some of the governments around the world, France. But if you strip those out, we feel like sales productivity is pretty stable. We certainly would like to see it higher. As we've talked about many times, we're continuing to do many things to move that in the right direction, but we certainly believe that -- with what we're seeing today across most of the field and as we see these few pockets recover, that we'll see improving sales productivity from here.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe you could talk a little bit -- we've heard some or picked up some data points that Europe is getting incrementally better on the margin. Maybe if you could just talk about what you're seeing there as far as demand is concerned.","Eugene A. Hall","So Joe, it's Gene. So overall in Europe, the -- we're seeing good demand for our services. As Chris mentioned, there's 2 particular areas that have been a little bit challenging for us, which is France, which with these operational issue; and then one of the federal governments has -- is going through similar things with what's going in the U.S. government. And so it's difficult to do business with them. Other than that, we're actually seeing quite good new business growth and very good retention in Europe.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question for me. Just on the governments -- the government side of the business, maybe you could frame your exposure, where you're seeing the pockets of weakness. And what's built into present guidance?","Eugene A. Hall","The -- let me just, spend a second to describe what's going on in the -- so every government is not a problem. As we have mentioned, we are -- we have double-digit growth in the public sector overall. There are couple of specific problems. And what's going on in there is the U.S. government is a great example where they've changing their procurement practices, in addition to having sequestration, which has just made things even more complicated. There is a period of time where you can't even meet with people. That makes it very tough to sell new business, much less renew their -- our existing business. That's kind of what's going on. As we look forward, I think I'll let Chris talk about that.","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes. So Joe, I would say just a couple of things. Overall, public sector, when we talk about public sector, what we've talked about from a sizing point of view, and public sector includes all of the governments around the world, state and local governments, all public enterprises, universities, health care systems, et cetera, it's in the 15% to 20% range. So that's kind of the sizing. As we talked about earlier, public sector in total is actually up double digit, so we're doing quite well across the overall public sector. And it really is just a handful of areas that are giving us some real challenges. And as we said earlier, you shouldn't be surprised that the U.S. Federal Government, as Gene talked about, is one of those areas. So our expectation for the remainder of the year is we continue to see the performance that we've had in those areas. We didn't expect that the U.S. government would suddenly improve anytime soon. And so that's kind of what we're thinking as we look forward in our guidance.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, I guess you mentioned France, so I guess the follow-up question is, how big is it roughly, even relative to your exposure in Europe?","Christopher J. Lafond","It's not significant. I mean, when you look at it, yes, it's one of the larger countries, obviously, in Europe and so it's obviously one of the bigger areas for us. But in total magnitude, it's not really significant in terms of overall percentage. But having said that, relatively small movements in some of these larger countries can make an impact and can impact overall that rate of contract value growth, right? So when you take a few things like the governments we've talked about, France, those few things have really moved the needle and taken us from 14% growth. If you strip those out, as I said, we're at 14% growth. But you're talking certainly under $50 million and much less than that in terms of where France is.","Brian Shipman","Contract value.","Christopher J. Lafond","Contract value.","Eugene A. Hall","Just as Chris said in his remarks, France basically had good double-digit growth, and it's slowed to single-digit growth. So it's not even going negative or anything like that, but it's slowed enough and it's big enough to where it had a -- that, combined with the 2 governments we mentioned, is what results in the net deceleration.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","No. From the comment, it sounded like the government situations, quite honestly, are somewhat outside your control, whereas you felt like France was more of operational, I believe you said. Is that...","Eugene A. Hall","It think that's the very characterization. So France has really operational issues that -- we're very, very good operationally. Occasionally, we have operational problems. France is one of those, and that will get fixed, we think, pretty quickly. The 2 federal governments we mentioned are kind of -- again, it's in the press every day in terms of what's going on with the federal governments. And so the -- so you're right, those are 2 different issues between France and then the 2 federal governments we've mentioned.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So can you help me understand what operational issues would -- I mean, is it leadership, sales, turnover, I mean, what type of issues?","Eugene A. Hall","Well, the -- we have a selling process and we have a renewal process. And when we follow that process well, it works great. And when we don't follow that process quite as well, it doesn't work so well. And so we just stood-out issues where we didn't follow the processes that we know work well. It's got a -- it's as simple as that. And we're obviously very focused on it, and we believe France will be quickly back on a good track.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, just the uptick you described in the U.S. growth, excluding the government, is there anything underlying that if you looked by kind of company size or vertical that -- or even how you've added sales people that's driving it?","Eugene A. Hall","Well, it's we have strong growth across all of the sectors. So it's not any one particular sector. Or we're kind of adding salespeople across all those sectors. So you -- to put it in perspective, we don't have one sector grow 50% the number of salespeople, another grow 0, because you can't handle it operationally. And so when you sort of think about it with our sales force growth being, as Chris said, in the range of 15%, it's kind of evenly spread. There might be some at 20% and some at 10%, but it's kind of evenly spread. And then if you look at demand, it's going to be evenly spread as well.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","The 14% growth that you guys cited x France, x the 2 -- was that x the 2 governments? Or is that x all public sector? What was that x?","Christopher J. Lafond","No, it's not. It's not excluding all public sector, it's just excluding a couple of governments around the world that we're particularly challenged, and France. So we really just had a few pockets, as we talked about. So if you just take those out, you're at 14%.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And what would that growth rate on a same-type basis have been in the last 2 quarters? Just wondering, is that's holding steady around 14%, and the overall deceleration is being driven by those pockets of weakness? Or are you starting to see acceleration, excluding those pockets of weakness?","Christopher J. Lafond","What I would say is it's pretty stable. As we said last quarter, we really just had a few pockets that were causing us to dip a bit, and that's still exactly the case. So everything else in the world is stable, and a few places slightly improving. As I talked about in my comments, the Americas actually accelerated a bit from Q3 to Q2. And we actually said the same thing last quarter. So the Americas is actually on a path of slight acceleration overall, excluding the U.S. government sector.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then can you remind us what percentage of new business sold in the Research business is sold in Q4?","Christopher J. Lafond","If you look at overall contract value, it's pretty balanced. So our overall contract value mix is not dramatically different quarter-by-quarter. It varies from, about 28-maybe percent of the renewals come up in Q4. So there's a little bit of variation, but it's all around the quarter. Q4 tends to be our larger new business quarter per share with our sales force into their accelerators, and their comp plan drives that.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then I think you obviously took out about 1%, I think, of the stock in this quarter via repurchases. You've said that remains a compelling use of capital but also said exploring, actively exploring, strategic alternatives. Would you guys consider a leveraged recap? Or what would it take for you to be even more aggressive on the share repurchases given the shape that your balance sheet's in and what type of free cash flow you throw off?","Christopher J. Lafond","I think what we have said over time is we do believe that we have the ability to take on significantly more debt. As always, we are looking at a number of things. We've told you many times that acquisitions remain something that's really important to us and they can drive significant shareholder value. The acquisitions we've done have been great uses of cash. And we've been able to take that content that we acquire, put it into our sales channel and drive pretty significant performance improvement over what big companies were doing on their own. And so we see great leverage out of doing that. And that's why we continue to look for those opportunities. So we would have no problem, with the right acquisition, to take on significantly more debt. And we will continue to be aggressive in our share repurchase program as well.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Would you consider taking on debt up to 1 or 2 turns of EBITDA, say, to do a share repurchase? Or would you only consider levering up for an acquisition?","Christopher J. Lafond","No, we have no problem taking on debt for any transaction that we think drives shareholder value. So we would certainly take on debt well above 3x debt-to-EBITDA because we can bring it down relatively quickly.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So I will preface my question by saying the revenue growth numbers are obviously pretty impressive in the context of the macro environment, but we always want more, obviously, as evidenced by the questioning. And so my question is, the U.S. government impact, can you sense or can you determine whether the purchases are deferred? Or is the U.S. government actually downsizing in terms of its purchase levels, and therefore, we should anticipate permanently reduced revenue from that channel?","Eugene A. Hall","So Peter, it's Gene. So the -- our -- what we sell to the federal government is an itty-bitty miniscule part of what they buy even in our field. There is huge opportunity there. The issue -- what's going on there is they had -- there's 2 things that have gone on in the last couple of quarters, which is they've changed the process by which they buy things and made it -- which is we have to adapt to that new process. So that's one thing that's happening. And so we know what those changes are. And we believe, over time, it's going to continue to be a great market for us because we understand what those changes are, they still have great need for our services, the value of our services. But the -- when they've -- as they change these processes, we have to change with them and adapt, it takes a little bit of time. And the second thing obviously is that sequestration just kind of stopped everything dead in the water for a while even beyond the period where the government has actually shut down. Obviously, it takes a while to kind of get started back up again and figure out what was where. So in -- the combination of changing buying processes and sequestration made it a tough environment. Having said that, there's the -- there's no lack of opportunity for us to grow in the federal government. It's a huge market. We have barely penetrated our opportunity there. They need and value our services. In fact, we have -- what's interesting about it, Peter, is if you'd look at the people, actually, in IT in the federal government, there is strong robust demand. The issue is getting it through the procurement processes that have changed, where the -- our IT people that ultimately use these services are kind of figuring out how to do that. We're figuring how to do it. And frankly, even the procurement people within the government are trying to sort out exactly how these changed process are going to work. And so there is totally robust demand. We're working with the clients that are dying to use our services, the IT people that are dying to use our services, to work our way through the new processes and are confident that, over the long term, it's going to -- it's been a great market for us and we continue to believe it's going to continue to be a great market for us.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Chris, the guidance gives you a pretty wide range here in the fourth quarter in terms of the possibilities. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what the over-unders are in terms of what gets you to the higher or lower end of the range here going into the end of the year?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, I would just make a couple of comments on guidance. I think, if you look at each of the 3 segments, I think, for a $1.3-plus-billion Research business, we have pretty tight guidance on that revenue range. So it -- really, that one is, as you can imagine, pretty easy to predict barring foreign exchange and a few other things. So that one is going to be a pretty tight range, which is why it is what it is. Consulting, as we talk about all the time, there's variability in our Contract Optimization business, so depending on when our large clients do these large transactions. So we think -- especially in Q4, we think that, that business can bounce around as clients are doing their year-end purchases. So that leaves us a little bit of variability. On the Events side, we're certainly having an incredibly strong year. We're finishing up. And this happens to be our largest events period, so even though we're going into Q4, it happens to be our largest period, so it's the period where we have potentially more variability. As you know, in the Events business, people sign up for events closer to the date of the event, so there's a kind of a hockey stick curve there. So that's why we have the range that we have on the revenue side. And those are really the big variability. We don't see anything, other than those things, that cause us any reason to be concerned.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And then Chris, just a number of questions. I may have missed this, but did you give the year-to-year change in attendance for ITxpo or your [indiscernible] for symposium? And then also, what was the magnitude of the price increase in the fourth quarter?","Christopher J. Lafond","We -- as you know, from -- I'll answer the price increase first then go back to our Events. We do 3% to 6%, has been the range. We're at the lower end of that again. We've been at the lower end of that now for the last few quarters given the current economic environment around the world. It's our objective to increase prices but do things in a thoughtful way, and that's kind of why we landed where we landed. And we will continue to do that. We expect to do that again in 2014 and beyond. So that's our continued strategy. With regard to Events, our events attendees have been up really nicely and exhibitors up really nicely through the third quarter. We didn't talk specifically about all the attendees at all of our symposium, but we've had -- and because we're going through those now. We've finished a bunch of them and have one more coming up in Barcelona next week. Attendance has been great. Exhibitors has been great. We've seen great attendance there, still well on track to what we expected. Obviously, you should not expect our fourth quarter numbers to be up quite as much as the full year because they're the bigger events, right? So our symposium events are bigger. And you're not going to see 20-plus-percent growth there. So you should not be concerned when you see that level of growth be a little less than you saw for the rest of the year. And they're more mature events. What has been great is we've seen a great CIO participation. We've seen significant increases in CIO participation at all the events. So we feel really good about our attendees and what we're seeing there.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","You're up -- I'm recalling, you're against a pretty tough comp because I'm remembering last year's attendance was very strong as well. So do you expect to be up in total attendance this year?","Christopher J. Lafond","Well, I think, yes. We absolutely do across-the-board across the symposiums. I think, from a CIO perspective, we're approaching 15% to 20% growth in the CIO attendees at all of our events. So that part's doing great. And the overall attendees are up in those conferences as well.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Jerry Herman of Stifel.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Not to beat up the government situation too much, you're probably sick of talking about it, but just wondering if the contract value will decelerate before it, in fact, accelerates given some of those headwinds. Is it enough to tip it in a sequential softening?","Christopher J. Lafond","Jerry, it's Chris. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen, to be honest. However, one thing I can tell you is that September is the big buying, year end, for the government. It's a big buying period, so we've gone through a lot of renewals. So we'd like to think that we're not going to see continued deceleration there as a result of that. As I said, we're seeing really good performance across the rest of the business. We're seeing acceleration in some other areas. We're certainly hoping not to see further deceleration as a result of that, but the government's right now fairly unpredictable. But that's kind of how we look at it right now.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And in Consulting, is the optimization business government oriented?","Christopher J. Lafond","No, not. Actually, not at all, really. It's pretty much all commercial business.","Eugene A. Hall","Many governments don't -- it's a success-fee-based business, so we get paid a portion of how much we save. Many governments are forbidden to use that type of arrangement. And so it has very little government business.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Makes sense. And then just on the sort of competitive landscape. Obviously, there's secular trends in the technology research area, but talk about your feelings about your market share and any other sort of competitive landscape changes that you've seen.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, I mean, the -- there are -- we have many kinds of competition. I don't think there's been any change in that competition. We're highly differentiated from everybody else who's out in the marketplace. We have a very strong brand. And frankly, the -- because we're so differentiated, there's been no change in competition, that's not an issue for us at all. So no different than it's been last year or the year before, or the year before that.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just one last question then I'll turn it over. Chris, you mentioned price increases. And you said, the last few quarters, you've been at 3% to 6%. I'm trying to be sure I understand the timing of your price increases. Are they in fact -- are they annual? Or do you do multiple price increases during the course of the year? Or is it just because that the contracts are essentially annual that you have such activity every quarter?","Christopher J. Lafond","If I said quarterly, I meant each of the last few years. But so yes, we do annual increases. We don't do them quarterly. Obviously, every client comes up for renewal during different periods of time, so we see the impact of that throughout the year. But we actually make the change once a year, in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Manav Patnaik of Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you just give us what the sales headcount number was this quarter? And also, sort of big picture, just trying to understand internally, you talk about a lot of productivity initiatives that you guys had ongoing. How should we think about the timing that you have targeted for in trying to see those results, and when we should expect that to help contract value growth reaccelerate?","Christopher J. Lafond","Manav, it's Chris. So the sales headcount ended -- our quota-bearing sales headcount ended at 1,605. That's up about 15% year-over-year, and that's kind of the expectation we have for the year in total, in growing it 15% year-over-year. With regard to sales productivity, one of the things that I think we've tried to talk about, and Gene can add some comments as well, is that we are constantly making change. So it's not like we have one thing that we think is going to happen in Q2. We're doing a lot of things all the time. So it's a constant set of systems that we expect all the time to be putting things into place to improving things we're operating on, to execute things that will have a continuous improvement in our sales productivity.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just maybe one last one, around net fund. In the context of the large market that you guys have sized before, what is -- like, how long should we expect the 15% to 20% net sales growth keep occurring? Like, is there a target sales force size that you guys have in mind?","Eugene A. Hall","So we do look at this. It's a great question. And the way we -- our estimate on it is, if we did not introduce any new products, which we will, but if we did not introduce new products, we could go 20% a year for the next 20 years with the market opportunity we've already identified. So and then aside from that, we'll introduce new products. Like, for example, but where we introduced a product to the marketing space, that doesn't include that product in the marketing space, as an example, that we introduced earlier this year. And...","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But that growth is depending on -- dependent on the feet on the street. Is that correct?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. The thing that constrains us from that growth is how many salespeople we have. The demand's out there. And again, that's if we had no new products. And if we could -- we don't lack for growth opportunity. It's a matter of how many salespeople you have.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. The first is, any color that you could provide in terms of the spending levels for new clients that you're signing up versus existing clients? It would be very helpful. Is the rate of spending, on an apples-to-apples with the existing clients, going up or down? And I guess, with the upselling? Are you seeing more success selling them new products or signing up new roles at the same client?","Christopher J. Lafond","Andre, it's Chris. So a couple of things. Just overall, average Research spend right now is about $97,000, almost $100,000, per client. So the average Research client. And that's all clients: new, existing, across the whole portfolio. What the -- and that has been going up. That's up about 4% since the end of the year, and up almost 7%. And as you would expect with price increase and other upsell, that's the expectation. That's very consistent in terms of what we've done year-over-year. So the average is going up. The new client spend is below that. It's probably about half of that, roughly. And that has been going up as well. So you're seeing a very consistent movement both in new clients, existing clients, and it's moving up pretty consistently.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And would you say, with the existing clients, is the upsell typically adding roles? Or have you been finding, let's say, your CIOs are taking on more of the products that you offer them?","Christopher J. Lafond","A combination of both, right? We have -- sometimes, we'll see a CIO upgrade their own seats. Sometimes, we'll see them add seats. As you know, we have products that start with the CIO and work all the way through the entire IT organization. So as we continue to penetrate organizations, you can see that, those new products being sold across the entire organization, including to the CIO him- or herself.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But you in rank 1 is having a bigger impact versus the other.","Christopher J. Lafond","No. They're pretty -- it's pretty balanced. And I think, when you look at our overall contract value growth and growth in existing clients, it's a combination of all of that. And I wouldn't say there's one that overrides the other. It's pretty well balanced.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly, on the goal of expanding margins over the multiyear period, any updated thoughts on that target? And I guess, of things that you can control, are there any investments outside of the sales force that we should be aware of that -- or levers that can allow you to either expand or contract with that, with meeting that goal?","Christopher J. Lafond","I think we have a pretty clear economic model that we have talked about over time. So if you look at our Research business, in -- on the Research side of the house, we expect a 70% incremental margin, and we're pretty well delivering on that. We're pretty close to that, as you saw in this quarter. And so there's no significantly different investment there that will drive that number differently. Could we certainly invest less in our Research business? Yes, and we could drive margin on that. We think that would be a bad long-term position, and not investing in enough research analysts and product enhancements for our clients. So I think you should expect that business to stay where it is. In our Events business, we know how to launch and run events. So we're pretty thoughtful about how we do that. And I don't think there's anything unique or different there going on in terms of significant new or different investments. And similarly, with Consulting, we've continued to invest in the managing partners. It's the reason you've seen the margin performance in that business, as we believe that's a good long-term strategy, continuing to add managing partners to allow the Consulting business to both sell and deliver, and reduce the reliance on our field sales force so they can focus more on our higher-margin Research business. So we'll continue to make that investment in the Consulting business. So I would say, on the gross margins side, those are the major things that you should think about. Below the line, we continue to believe that long-term sales force expansion at 15% to 20% is exactly the right level both because of our market opportunity and with our operational ability to hire that many people, which we can do effectively. And really from a margin and a leverage perspective, we expect that, as sales productivity improves, that's going to give us really nice operating leverage and continue to allow us to be in that 50 to 150 basis point margin expansion range that we've delivered pretty consistently for quite some time.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just wanted to follow up on the questions on the Consulting side. You mentioned the investments in managing partners. Is that the reason that utilization has dropped? And are you still adding billable headcount as well?","Christopher J. Lafond","So a couple of things. Billable headcount is actually up year-over-year. It's up about 3%. A chunk of that is the managing partners. So that is a portion of that hiring. Certainly, adding managing partners has a bit of an impact on utilization, without a doubt, as they are not as billable as consultants on the frontline. But we had -- as we mentioned on the call, that business has also been impacted a little bit by the federal government sector. We have a nice practice in that area, and so we're getting impacted there. So there's a number of things there that are impacting that utilization a bit, but absolutely, managing partners does contribute to that.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Speaking of, does the Consulting segment have a little bit more of public sector exposure than your other segments?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, yes. I wouldn't say hugely different globally. In the U.S., certainly a bit more; and globally, a bit more. So yes, it is a little bit more weighted there.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And then you talked about the -- your opportunities in your Research business in terms of continuing to add sales force. I'm just wondering, is it getting more difficult to find salespeople? I know the economy is not that robust, but the hiring market seems to be improving.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, it's Gene. So we don't have any trouble hiring salespeople. First, the -- Gartner is viewed among people that want to sell technology as being a great place to be. We're a great brand. They know that we have very strong offerings. And so the -- and if you -- there are various things, like Glassdoor, where we're rated -- like Glassdoor or LinkedIn, where we're rated one of the top employers. And so we don't have trouble attracting people at all. It's the first thing. Second thing is, if you look at the world of technology salespeople, the demand we have is really miniscule compared to all of the technology salespeople in any of the markets that we're in. So there's a very gigantic pool, of which we are a teeny portion. And on top of it, we're a very attractive place to be for sales. So we don't have any trouble at all both attracting great salespeople.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee of Gartner (sic) [Barclays Capital].","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, to go back to the challenged area, I'm sorry to continue to beat on that, but why do you think these things popped out now? Is the U.S. Federal Government because you're into the new fiscal year and maybe you thought the purse strings would loosen up a little bit but now you know it hasn't? And in France, it feels like the data is getting a little better. So why aren't these issues that popped up earlier?","Eugene A. Hall","So it's Gene. So there are 2 separate issues. So in the federal government, they -- again, as I mentioned before, they have -- recently, this was not over the last 3 years, whatever, they have recently changed their procurement practices. And that's fundamentally what -- that, in combination with the sequestration, are what's fundamentally driving the issues with federal government. And so it's -- they've changed how they buy, so the number of framework agreements -- they have these things that you bond called framework agreements, the number you have to deal with, things like that. So it's just, operationally, the way you sell and the way they buy has changed and it takes a little while for people to adapt to that. Now this is -- frankly, it's -- they're doing the same thing on their side. The -- and just one other point too on the federal government is their yearend is in September, and so the -- there's a disproportionate number of contracts that come up for renewals and\/or new sales that happened in September, as opposed to the rest of the year. So that would have an -- affected our Q3 as opposed to Qs 1, 2 and 4. So in the federal government, that's the kind of situation there. And as I mentioned earlier, we think we understand what's going on there. The people that actually use our services are dying to buy, there's tremendous demand. It's just making sure that we and they adapt to these changed procurement processes. Again, I'm very optimistic that we'll have great results with the federal government over the next few years.","Then France is totally a different issue, which is just the -- as I mentioned, we're very good operationally, but we're not perfect. And so we had some operational issues in France where we didn't kind of follow what we know are the right kinds of processes. We've identified those problems. It won't take a week to fix, but I'm -- France has been a great growth for us. Again, even with these issues, France went from great double-digit growth to single-digit growth. So it's not like it went negative or something, it's -- but again, if you're growing great and you're slow, it has an impact on our -- it has an impact on our overall growth rate. We know what issues are in France. We're going to get France back up to double-digit growth, I don't have any concerns about that at all. So there's 2 separate issues between the federal government and from France.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the Events business has really had a terrific year. I know you're not talking about 2014 yet, but how -- can you just talk to us about how you will, from a strategy perspective, continue to expand this business? Is there anything you can say about how you'll gain new attendees to get us comfortable that these big events can actually grow on top of another great year here, and that there is more room in the calendar to add more events?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, it's Gene. So our strategy in our Events business is to grow in 2 ways. One is by launching new events, and we launch new events every year. We launched some this year, we'll launch some next year. So for example, this year, we launched a symposium in Dubai. And that symposium in Dubai is in its first year. Then what happens is, after we launch these events, we'll have a Dubai symposium again next year. We expect that we'll have really robust growth in -- to use that as an example, in that Dubai event next year. We're very -- we're expecting high-double-digit -- very robust double-digit growth year-over-year in that event in both attendees and exhibitors. And so our -- that's -- really, the essence of our strategy is launch new events, and there are plenty of opportunities to launch events around the world. We're in 85 countries. We don't have events anywhere near that number, so we've got loads of places where we can launch new events, including places like the U.S. and Europe. And then secondly -- that, you might think, were more mature. And then secondly, we have plenty of growth at those events. And even if the events were kind of very tight space-wise, we have ideas of how to address those issues. So as an example, in our -- in Orlando where we hold our U.S. symposium ITxpo, the -- we've added -- we've built temporary space there and we're also working with the owners of the properties to figure out ways to expand the available space we have there. So we're not concerned at all about being able to grow, either by launching new events. There's, like, probably more than 100 events that we could launch that we know about today, and we have -- this year, we'll have 60...","Christopher J. Lafond","63 to 65.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, 63 to 65 events. So there's, like, loads of growth there. And then within each of those, there's plenty of room for growth as well.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, how far would you consider broadening what you do or broadening the scope of areas you research, to entertain attractive M&A opportunities? Or you've obviously been very selective, and I think that's terrific, but are there any new areas you'd look at? Or would you consider broadening the platform at all?","Eugene A. Hall","So we're very interested in acquisitions. We have a person who focuses full time on looking at potential deals. We're tracking -- there's -- at any given point in time, there's something, like, 100 companies that we track that we are interested in buying. And so -- but of course, the buy has to be right pricing and the right other kinds of terms. And those things happen from time to time. And when they do, we move quickly.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to hand back to Brian for any closing comments.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. Please note this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Cohen, Gartner's GVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","David Cohen - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Denise, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Gartner's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer. This call include a discussion of third quarter 2018 financial results and our current outlook for 2018 as disclosed in today's press release.","In addition to today's press release, we have provided an expanded supplemental document for investors and analysts, in which we provide a detailed review of our financials and business metrics. And the supplemental document included a full non-GAAP P&L, excluding all the divested operations. This table combines Heritage Gartner and Heritage CEB, and removes the operating results of the divestitures starting January 1, 2017.","For 2018, the table provides results as if we had used the net proceeds from the divestitures to repay debt on December 31, 2017. This gives you a view down to adjusted EPS for 2018 that reflects how we are thinking about the business as we plan for 2019. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX neutral, unless stated otherwise We've posted the press release and supplemental PDF to our website, investor.gartner.com. Following comments by Gene and Craig, we will open up the call for questions.","On the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to revenue and contribution margin are for adjusted revenue excluding divested operations and adjusted contribution margin excluding divested operations which exclude the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments and the recently divested businesses.","All references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA excluding divested operations with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and excluding the divested operations. All cash flow numbers unless stated otherwise are as reported with no adjustments related to the divested operations. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website.","Finally, all contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2018 foreign exchange rates. In the earnings supplemental, the abbreviation ex D.O. indicates that the metric excludes divested operations.","As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2017 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in those documents.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. Thanks for joining us. We drove another strong quarter of double-digit growth in Q3 with total revenues up 13% and EBITDA up 17%. We continue to see strength within each of our three businesses; Research, Consulting and Events. Research revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Consulting revenue was up 10% year-over-year with backlog up 18% on a reported basis. On a same-event basis, Events revenue was up 21% and the number of attendees was up 17% year-over-year.","We continue to apply the Gartner Formula for growth to both Global Technology Sales and to Global Business Sales. Global Technology Sales was up 14% and again delivered double-digit growth in every region across every size company and in virtually every industry. We continue to pursue the enormous growth opportunity with our GTS clients and prospects.","We also have an enormous growth opportunity by applying the Gartner Formula to GBS. Applying the Gartner Formula has required an unusually large amount of change for GBS during 2017 and 2018. We restructured the organization. We eliminated discounting and reconfigured contract terms and conditions. We introduced seat-based offerings and made many more changes. These changes put in place the foundation for sustained double-digit growth in the future. Change of this magnitude puts everyone affected on a new learning curve and this impacted short-term productivity, as we expected.","Looking to the future with much of the foundation in place, we expect our teams will advance on the learning curve, resulting in sustained double-digit growth. First, our GBS leadership team and salespeople understand and are fully bought in to the Gartner Formula. They have the will. They're determined to succeed and they're incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. With this determination and excitement, their skills in executing the Gartner Formula are getting better every day.","Clients appreciate the strong value proposition in our new seat-based products. As a result, over the past three quarters, the proportion of our salespeople who sold their first seat-based deal has grown rapidly. And once they've sold their first deal, salespeople quickly accelerate in selling their second, third and more. As you might expect, the proportion of a seat-based contract value has also rapidly grown.","Our business development salespeople in GBS have already achieved similar levels of productivity to their colleagues in GTS. Our account executives are also accelerating their sales of seat-based products. Account executives also have renewals to process. So, their seat-based sales are accelerating at a slower rate than the business development salespeople. One of the key elements in the Gartner Formula is advanced analytics-based selling tools. These tools are critical element of the strong performance in GTS. We've recently implemented these tools for GTS and GBS will benefit in the same way.","Retention is critical in our business and we're world class. Throughout 2018, we've added GBS service teams for the Gartner Formula. We're already seeing benefits in the places we've deployed these teams. As we scale other areas of GBS, we expect this will drive further improvements on retention.","Focus is another core element of the Gartner Formula. So we've divested businesses that weren't central to our strategy. And finally, we know from our track record extending more than a decade that if we have more salespeople, we will sell more. We'll close 2018 with a substantially more capacity and will add even more during 2019 So in GBS, with much of the foundation in place, we expect the learning curve to accelerate, resulting in sustained double-digit growth.","In closing, we have strengthened all three of our business segments. I recently experienced the power of Gartner in helping clients achieve their mission-critical priorities when I attended our Symposium Conference in Orlando. This event is the most important gathering of CIOs and senior IT executives in North America.","The executives were inspired and empowered to succeed as a result of the insights we delivered at this important event. Our associates were equally inspired and excited about the incredible value we deliver to our clients. I encourage all of you to attend at least one of these events to experience the power of Gartner for yourself.","We have an incredibly large market opportunity. We know the right things to do to drive success in our business by applying the Gartner Formula and we're on track to achieve sustained double-digit growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows for years to come.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Craig Safian, our Chief Financial Officer.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Demand for our services remains robust around the world and in the third quarter, we delivered excellent financial results across our three primary operating segments. As our fourth quarter 2018 outlook demonstrates, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth with strong cash flow generation. Before reviewing our Q3 performance, I wanted to provide you with an update related to our planned 2018 divestiture activity.","Once assessing which assets were non-core to our business, we set in motion a process to divest those businesses. In Q2, we sold CEB Talent Assessment for about $400 million and CEB Workforce Surveys for about $28 million. We sold Challenger Sales Training for about $120 million in Q3 and we closed on Metrics That Matter yesterday for about $15 million.","Divesting these non-core businesses allows us to increase our focus on the core as well as utilizing the proceeds to rapidly delever our balance sheet. On our website, we've provided a full normalized, non-GAAP P&L, which excludes divested operations to give you a clean look for 2018 by quarter down to adjusted EPS. This P&L reflects how we are thinking about the business as we plan for 2019.","Third quarter revenue was $910 million, up 11% and up 13% on an FX-neutral basis. The purchase accounting adjustment for deferred revenue was down to about $250,000 for the quarter. We also delivered contribution margins of 64%, up about 100 basis points from the prior year, EBITDA of $149 million, up 15% year-over-year and 17% FX-neutral, and adjusted EPS excluding divested operations of $0.83 per share. The divested operations amount we excluded was about $0.02 per share in the quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was $251 million.","Research had another excellent quarter with significant year-over-year growth in revenue. Contribution margin also improved. Research revenue grew 11% in the third quarter and 12% on an FX-neutral basis. The contribution margin for Research was 69%. Total contract value was $3.0 billion at September 30, growth of 12% versus the prior year. We always report contract value growth in FX-neutral terms.","I'll now review the details of our performance for both GTS and GBS. In the third quarter, GTS contract value increased 14% versus the prior year. GTS now has contract value of $2.4 billion. Client retention for GTS remained strong at 83%. Wallet retention for GTS was 105% for the quarter, up 120 basis points year-over-year and the highest level we've reported since measuring GTS.","GTS wallet retention rates reflect the combination of greater spending and greater retention rates with our higher spending and larger clients. GTS growth of new business was 8% versus the third quarter of last year. We had a number of new business deals slip out of the third quarter that have since closed in October and the pipeline for Q4 remains very strong.","We continue to see a mix of new business across new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. We ended the third quarter with 12,477 GTS clients, up 6% compared to Q3 2017. The average contract value per enterprise also continues to grow. It now stands at $192,000 per enterprise in GTS, up 8% year-over-year. This continued and consistent increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth both through new and existing enterprises.","Our investments to improve sales force productivity continued to pay off with an increase again this quarter. For GTS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing head count, was $112,000 per salesperson, up 11% versus the third quarter of last year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year productivity improvement.","Turning to Global Business Sales. As of September 30, GBS had contract value of $615 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4%. Note that some of the historical GBS numbers have changed to reflect the divestitures of the Challenger Sales Training and Metrics That Matter businesses. We continue to make progress with GBS retention metrics. GBS client retention was 83%, up more than 375 basis points from the prior year and an all-time high for GBS.","GBS wallet retention was 97%, up more than 100 basis points versus the prior year and up about 40 basis points sequentially. New business declined by 6% in the quarter versus the prior year as the growing sales of seat-based products wasn't yet enough to offset the lower sales of legacy products. We ended the third quarter with 5,675 GBS clients, up 2% versus the prior-year period.","For GBS, productivity was relatively stable compared with both second quarter of 2018 and third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year net contract value increase or NCVI divided by the beginning period quota-bearing head count was $38,000, down a few thousand dollars compared to both the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year.","The productivity reflects the operational shifts we have the sales team making to the new Gartner seat-based products. Our data and analytics show that as our sellers gain more experience with the new products, their productivity improves.","The average contract value per enterprise at GBS increased about 2% to $108,000. This increase reflects our ability to drive CV growth both through new and existing enterprises at GBS as well as GTS. Since the third quarter of last year, we have made a number of changes and operational improvements to the GBS business to follow the Gartner growth formula that we detailed at Investor Day. All of these changes and the improvements Gene highlighted earlier provide the foundation for sustained long-term double-digit growth.","Our Research business performance in Q3 was very strong. GTS was outstanding with increases in wallet retention and sales productivity. For GBS, the early indications reinforce our outlook for double-digit contract value growth next year and 12-plus percent growth in 2020.","In Events, revenues increased by 27% year-on-year in Q3 to $57 million. FX-neutral growth was 30%. Events third quarter gross contribution margin was 44%. Gross contribution increased 55% from last year's quarter. We had 17 destination events in Q3 consistent with last year. On a same-event, FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 21% with a 17% increase in same-event attendees.","Third quarter Consulting revenues increased by 9% to $79 million. FX-neutral growth was about 10%. Labor-based revenues were $70 million. In the labor-based business, revenues increased 8% versus Q3 of last year or 9% on an FX-neutral basis. On the labor-based side, billable head count of 727 was up 7% and we had 135 managing partners at the end of Q3, about flat versus the prior year.","Backlog, which measures labor-based projects under contract where there is more work to be done, is the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business. Backlog ended the quarter at $108 million, up 18% year-over-year. Our bookings performance remained strong and our Q4 pipeline is encouraging. The contract optimization business was up 19% versus the prior year quarter, helped by an easier compare. Overall, Consulting gross contribution margin was 23% in the third quarter.","With the divestitures we discussed earlier, there is essentially no revenue left in the Other segment. Going forward, we will be reporting our business in three segments; Research, Consulting and Events. The small amount left in Other will be consolidated into the Research segment.","On a GAAP basis, SG&A increased by 6% year-over-year in the third quarter and 8% on an FX-neutral basis. Adjusting for the divestitures and other non-recurring items, SG&A increased 13% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis.","We continue to grow sales capacity and the enabling infrastructure to support our strategy of delivering sustained, double-digit growth over the long term. The enabling infrastructure includes investments in human resources functions, like recruiting and real estate to support the increased number of associates around the world.","Our sales force continues to be our largest investment and at the end of the third quarter, we had 3,720 quota-bearing associates in Research. This includes 2,955 in GTS and 765 in GBS, or a growth of 13% and 20%, respectively.","EBITDA for the third quarter was $149 million, up 15%. FX-neutral growth in EBITDA was 17%. Depreciation and amortization were about flat with last year, while integration expenses were down year-over-year as we have moved past the biggest part of the integration work. Interest expense in the quarter was $27 million, down from $39 million in the third quarter of 2017. The lower interest expense relates to paying down debt over the past year.","Our adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 20% for the quarter. The rate for the quarter was lower than anticipated due in large part to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation and excess tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation.","Adjusted EPS, including the divested operations in Q3, was $0.85 with upside relative to our expectations driven by strong operating performance, which includes some costs that slipped into the fourth quarter as well as benefits from a number of below-the-line items. Excluding the divested operations, adjusted EPS in Q3 was $0.83 per share.","In Q3, operating cash flow was $249 million compared to $150 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was driven by strong operating results, lower interest expense and improvements and catch-up in working capital.","Q3 2018 CapEx was $25 million and Q3 cash acquisition and integration payments and other nonrecurring items were approximately $26 million. We had some planned Q3 CapEx slipped into the fourth quarter.","This yields Q3 free cash flow of $251 million, which is up more than 70% versus the prior year quarter. On a rolling four-quarter basis, our free cash flow conversion was 137% of adjusted net income, including divested operations. While free cash flow conversion on a trailing 12-month basis is very strong, we expect a modest Q4 for free cash flow, which will temporarily reduce that measure again.","The GBS business has the same working capital characteristics as our GTS business. And as we see acceleration in GBS contract value, we would expect to see a corresponding improvement in our free cash flow conversion metrics.","During the third quarter of 2018, we repaid $262 million of debt, leaving our September 30 debt balance at about $2.2 billion. That's down more than $1.4 billion since the acquisition. As of the end of Q3, all of our debt is fixed rate. Our gross leverage on a reported basis is about 3 times. Adjusting EBITDA for the divestitures, our gross leverage ratio is now about 3.3 times EBITDA. And with strong EBITDA in the fourth quarter, we are in range of our leverage target.","Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We deploy our free cash flow and balance sheet flexibility on strategic value-enhancing M&A and returning capital to our shareholders through our buyback programs. During the month of October, we took advantage of the lower stock price to repurchase over $60 million worth of our stock.","Turning to the outlook for 2018. With our planned divestitures completed, we have provided you with a set of non-GAAP financials we use to evaluate the business on the basis we will have going forward. In the supplemental document available on our website, we provide a walk from the original guidance we provided in February to the guidance we're giving now.","With all the moving parts related to divestitures, we are providing guidance for the fourth quarter rather than for the full year. Our operating expectations for the full year are tracking to what we first outlined in February. Our adjusted EPS outlook is stronger now as below-the-line upside from depreciation, equity compensation and tax flows through.","With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar that we saw over the course of the third quarter, we expect to see our top-line reported results impacted again in the fourth quarter by FX. As you update your models for Q4, please keep in mind that our original estimates for reported revenues, reported expenses, and reported EBITDA will be impacted by about 1% due to the stronger U.S. dollar. This is baked into our Q4 guidance figures.","The highlights of our fourth quarter guidance are as follows. For Q4 2018, we expect adjusted revenues of approximately $1.070 billion to $1.115 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $211 million to $231 million. Amortization will see a noticeable step down from about $51 million in Q3 to about $35 million in Q4. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 29% for the fourth quarter implying a full year tax rate of about 25%.","Please note that if you are adding back from GAAP net income, the rate for the tax effect on the add-backs in the fourth quarter is about 21%. We expect fourth quarter 2018 adjusted EPS, excluding divested operations, of between $1.18 and $1.34 per share. For the full year, without adjusting for the divestitures, we expect free cash flow of $440 million to $460 million. At the midpoint, the conversion from the comparable basis adjusted net income is almost 130%.","Consistent with typical seasonality and some capital expenditures that slipped into the fourth quarter, we expect free cash flow in the fourth quarter to be slightly negative. All of the details of our guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.","Our strong 2018 financial and operating performance across all of our operating segments continued in the third quarter. Notably, we sustained strong GTS contract value growth of 14% for the quarter and sales of our new seat-based products in GBS continue to scale.","Free cash flow improved significantly in the quarter. We have divested all of the identified non-core assets and used those proceeds to rapidly delever. We've reduced our debt balance by more than $1.4 billion since the acquisition in 2017. The trends going into the fourth quarter are strong and our teams are executing the 2018 plan. As we shared with you at Investor Day, we are applying the Gartner growth formula across the combined business to drive sustained, long-term, double-digit growth to revenue, earnings, and free cash flow.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Safian. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question will be from Timothy McHugh of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. I guess, just wanted to follow-up on the GBS productivity kind of discussion. And I guess one comment, which you made, I think, it was that the business development staff was at the same productivity as GTS, but the account executives aren't. So, can you help us understand, I guess, how much of the business activity comes from each of those? And I guess, if one is already at the productivity level of GTS, the implication of account executives are, I guess, severely lower than the comparable role at GTS. So, can you talk at all about that? Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Tim. It's Gene. I'll get started and then Craig can follow-up. So, basically, we have two kinds of salespeople. Business developers that have a set of prospects that aren't buying anything from us today and so that's one kind of a selling cycle. And then we have different kind of salespeople, which we call account executives, who actually have existing clients, and their job is to renew those existing clients and to sell additional business to those existing clients. And as you mentioned, one of the things that we've been very \u2013 that has gone very well is that the sales productivity of our business developers at this point is roughly comparable to the sales productivity of business developers both between GTS and GBS.","On the account executives side, what's going on is two things. The salespeople, first of all \u2013 so, let me go to BDs. Business developers, all they have to do is to sell new clients with this new product. They don't have to renew all of those. And so, the learning curve they have is a lot simpler if you're just selling the new product than if you have to sell \u2013 have to renew the old one and also maybe have clients that say (28:51) I have the old product, can I extend it or whatever versus selling to all new clients. So, what's really going on is the business developers have a much faster learning curve and they've gone up that learning curve nicely because it's a much simpler selling task.","On the account executives, first, they have a more complicated learning curve, as I mentioned, because they have to go through all the renewals. In addition, the amount of renewals that they have to do is quite high relative to the GTS account executives. We are changing that over time. So, over time, we're reducing the amount of renewals that each of the account executives has to do. Over the short term, they have substantially more renewals than the GTS account executives. That limits \u2013 so their time available to sell the new products is limited because of that relative to a GTS account executive. And so, as a result, their learning curve on selling the new products is slower.","They're actually doing quite well. So if you look at it \u2013 in each quarter, the proportion of account executives that have sold at least one sale that's in the new seat-based products has been growing sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and it's now a substantial part of our total sales force. In addition, if you look at those that sold one three quarters ago, now they're selling \u2013 they have continued selling and that pace has accelerated. The same for those who've sold two, they accelerate again, but at a slower acceleration to business developers for the reason I just talked about. And so, they've a slower learning curve, but they're climbing up that learning curve quite nicely, given the additional workload they have from all the renewals they have to do.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And then Tim, the other thing just worth mentioning, to add on to Gene's point, is around the legacy leadership councils and the account executives largely having that in their territory to renew and\/or migrate. And then all the business that the business developers are selling, which is seat-based, will then be covered by account executives going forward. But inherently, those account executive territories will have more opportunity because we haven't sold a enterprise license leadership council. We'll actually have seat-based products in there, which will allow us to further penetrate the organization, the buying center, the function in the same way that we do on the GTS side.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then I guess, just more broadly, I think one of the biggest questions people have is just trying to, I guess, share probably the confidence you express on GBS' growth rate improving. So, is this the metric that you focus the most on, that kind of account executive productivity? I guess, what are you seeing besides this maybe that you would point to that, I guess, reinforces the confidence that it will get better from here?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, Tim. It's the set of things. So, it's not a single metric. Actually, there's a set of things that I talked through in my prepared remarks. And what it is really are, we know from our experience in GTS, the foundational elements that lead to sustained double-digit growth. And so, we've been putting those foundational elements in place. And the things I talked about in my opening remarks that we know will pay off over time. So, first, I'll give you some examples. So, we switch products to a seat-based product and we know a seat-based product, as Craig said, gives you both higher retention rates and also gives you more growth opportunities to it.","Now, one of the questions then is when you use seat-based products, do HR professionals or finance professionals get as much value as the IT professionals? And so, one of the things we're seeing actually is, yes, they get just as much value. So, we've been very successful in \u2013 we've introduced those new products and the uptake has been very good. And as I mentioned, the uptake accelerates. So, what you've got is some legacy products in the pipeline that already have been \u2013 proposals have been put into clients. So, we let those follow through.","Those have been falling off. What's been rising is sales of the seat-based products and it's been rising at a good rate. The net kind of looks like zero, but under the covers, you see this really rapid rise of the new seat-based products. And we talk to clients \u2013 we do see them selling well and we talk to clients about them. They really understand that there's a lot better value. And just as a recap, the reason there's better value is that, first of all, you get the traditional research, like an HR that we had from CEB, but you also then get all the technology stuff that's related to HR, things like how to \u2013 selecting products like Workday and how to implement things like that, that HR leaders care about and the same thing is true for finance and legal and all the other functions.","And then also just there's inherently more value in the seat-based product. And then, we look at things like, as I mentioned before, the first \u2013 if you've been selling enterprise agreements, the hardest sale you have to make on a seat-based product is that first sale. And the proportion of our salespeople in both account executive and business developers that have made that first sale has been rising every quarter and now is a substantial portion of our sales force.","That's another, what I'd say, foundational element that gives us confidence we're on a really good track there. And then beyond that, the ones who've sold one, then rapidly then sell two or three or four right in sequence. And so, as we would expect, the first one is the hardest. Once they sell the first one, they understand how to explain the value proposition to clients, how to address objections that client might have for both the seat-based products, the fact we don't discount.","Once they get that first sale with those terms and that kind of product, they get confidence, they get their talk tracks down and their learning curve accelerates. And so, as we look at it, clients love the products. The products are being taken up well. The proportion of salespeople that have made their first sale has been growing rapidly. And those that made first sale early on have continued with further \u2013 accelerated the number of sales they can make \u2013 the amount of time it takes to make a sale has improved.","In addition to that and I mentioned this, we have \u2013 so all the new seat-based products have the Gartner traditional services support, which has driven great retention. Our legacy leadership councils didn't have those kinds of support. We implemented that on some of the leadership councils and found that retention went up substantially. We've continued now to add more of that service support to that whole product line.","Those people just came onboard, but we'd expect to see the same kind of retention improvements that we did in our first pilot groups that we did at the end of last year as we would with these new ones that we've done throughout this year. That'll impact really 2019. So, those are some \u2013 and I guess one other thing I'll mention that's really important, which is any time you have a change program, the single most important thing is whether the people that are changing are bought in or not. And our GBS leadership team, and down to the individual salesperson level, are totally bought in.","They understand that it gives much more opportunity by having the seat-based products. It provides more value to clients. If you're not dealing discount, you're going to be focused on talking about value which is sort of all of our strategy. They actually understand it and bought in. And I spent a lot of time with that team. They understand it, they're bought in and they're excited about it. And so, there are others I could go through. I went through a couple others in my talk track. But those are the kinds of things that give us confidence that we're on a really good trajectory.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will be from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you. You referenced some of the factors, but I'd hope if we can maybe put some numbers around it. Just in terms of the Q3 upside and then the Q4 guidance, just help us understand on the Q4 guidance, like what is the divestiture impact. You talked about some cost slipping into Q4. Are those SG&A or what are they? How much are they? FX is worse, that was a factor. So, just if you can kind of help us bridge the Q3 upside and the Q4 guidance on some of the factors you cited with maybe some rough numbers.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff. So, the way to think about the Q3 upside is the bulk of the upside came from below-the-line items, most notably depreciation, equity compensation expense, lower tax rate, and a little bit of benefit from a shares perspective. And obviously, that sticks and there's upside in Q4, which we flow through into the Q4 guidance on EPS.","On the EBITDA side, we beat the top end of our guidance by about $0.06 in the quarter. Probably about half of that was spending that we expected to happen in Q3 that got pushed into Q4. And so, as we think about rolling into Q4 and also marking for foreign exchange rates and things of that nature, when you look at the full-year guidance, the Q4 guidance and then apply it to the first three quarters of actuals ex-divested operations, the way to think about it is we tightened the ranges on revenue, midpoint is a little bit higher than the initial guidance. We tightened the range on EBITDA, midpoint is essentially exactly the same as where we started out. And we tightened the range on EPS, but the midpoint moved up about $0.20 per share. All of that baked into the below-the-line benefits we talked about.","In terms of the divested operations that come out in Q4, it's around $8 million to $10 million worth of EBITDA that we will not have now that those two businesses are no longer a part of Gartner.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess, Tim asked a variation of this question, but just keying in on the \u2013 for me, the GBS new business metric being down, I think it was 6%, just help me understand, with all of the head count growth \u2013 I think a lot of the head count growth is occurring in the business development staff where you're seeing a good productivity ramp. And on the account executives side, given that they were previously selling enterprise-wide deals, I would have thought that under the CEB model, it was already hard for them to sell a lot of new business. So, I'm just having a hard time reconciling all these factors with a decline in GBS new business sales. Thank you.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Jeff, I'll start off and then Gene will wrap up on the question. I think a few things to consider. So number one, the decline in new business was actually better than what we saw in Q2. So, we actually saw an acceleration of performance from Q2 to Q3 on the new business side. The other thing worth mentioning, while there were enterprise licenses, the account executives who covered those businesses still did sell a decent amount of new business.","The bulk of the new business was sold by business developers, but the account executives did sell some new business, incremental leadership councils or incremental smaller functional areas within the functions that they were selling to. And they're now making the transition to renewing those leadership councils, attempting to migrate those accounts, if they want to, into seat-based products and learning all those new seat-based products. And so, that is taking some time, as we expected, given all the change that we've implemented with that team.","The other thing worth mentioning in terms of the incremental capacity and we talked about this last quarter is we have such a high proportion of our sellers who are in their first year. They have less than one year of experience. And as you know, from your experience with Gartner, the productivity in that first year is generally very low or relatively low, and we see it improve over time. And so, again, the way we think about this is we're doing all the right things. We know the formula to apply and we're essentially really laying the foundation for accelerated growth in 2019, 2020 and beyond.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. My first question was, I guess, I understand your comment on providing support staff, I guess, for your folk in terms of renewals, because of the time they're spending there. But then, does that then imply that when they're trying to go in for the renewals and, presumably, they're trying to sell your new seat-based offering that the clients are pushing back on subscribing to that? Like, can you just help us understand like maybe how much are switching and how much are choosing not to?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","It's Gene, Manav. So, basically, the philosophy that we've approached with this, if we have a happy client with an existing product and they want to keep renewing forever, we're happy with that. And so, what we do is we go through with our clients and those that are very satisfied with the legacy products and want to keep renewing and we have a little price increase each year, we let them do it and we're happy to do it. For those that have some questions about value, whatever, we go and we show them the new products, which are priced higher, by the way, substantially higher, and we sell them the new products. So, we're actually getting good uptake among the clients that say, I'm not necessarily that happy with the existing product. We're actually getting good uptake and conversion and a substantial portion of our seat-based sales in the account executive channel.","And so, it would be the \u2013 the other thing about that is that we're not actually going \u2013 we are happy if a client keeps renewing. We've great incremental margins with our legacy products. We're very happy for them to keep renewing. It's got a low sales cost, great gross margins and focus on selling the new. As I mentioned, what's going on is, under the covers, the amount of legacy new product sales has been declining because you didn't stop, in a binary sense, because even though we stopped making new proposals, any proposals in the pipeline, we'll let salespeople and clients go ahead and close. In the meantime, they've been switching now to selling the newer products, the seat-based products, and that's been rising rapidly and that has been kind of flat so far, but based on trends, we expect that will change.","And also, as Craig said, we've added a lot of capacity, as you know, in the first year. And as Craig said, the first year you hire people, you train them, and then they have to get up the curve. Their selling productivity is the lowest, obviously, in their first year.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then maybe just broadly, I mean, I guess, I understand when you go into this detail that, I guess, you guys get to see it kind of anecdotally makes sense what's going on there. But in terms of your commitment to get to double-digit growth next year and 12% in 2020, like what sort of cadence should we expect in terms of how does growth start showing up either quarterly or, I don't know, by midyear? Like how long does it take to get there?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning, Manav. The way we think about it is, obviously, we've laid out the target, and we remain as committed to that target as we've been. And hopefully, you've got a sense for the confidence that Gene expressed in our ability to nail that target by the end of 2019. Our expectation is we will see or should see progress over the course of 2019. We're not going to commit to a certain percentage rate by quarter. The baseline is not a huge number. So, it is sensitive to a little bit upside or a little bit of downside. But we remain 100% committed to being able to hit that double-digit CV growth target by the end of next year.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. So, Manav, we've modeled out what we need to do to get to that target. Like quarter-by-quarter, what sales productivity we need, what renewal rates we need, what rate \u2013 what new business productivity we need. And so, it's not a hope and a dream. It's basically we've modeled it out. We know what we have to do. Our sales teams and service teams know what they have to do and we think we'll see the acceleration throughout 2019. And it's not going to be three quarters of zero growth and then all of a sudden it goes to double digit. You'll see the acceleration.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question will be from Gary Bisbee of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","(46:00) guys. So, what kind of sales head count growth would you expect to need to deliver that double-digit contract value in GBS. I mean, obviously, it's substantially faster today. But with the pace of hiring \u2013 do you think you can hit it while slowing the pace of hiring? In other words, would you expect productivity to step up meaningfully next year, or should we think that, while you're continuing to work through this and season the sales staff that it would likely need a continued growth of sales head count well in excess of the contract value that you plan to deliver?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, we believe that GBS has the potential to grow faster than GTS on a sustained basis, because the penetration is still low. And so, we're actually increasing our sales head count not to hit 10%, but to \u2013 we're growing our sales head count to far exceed that, and I won't \u2013 I'm not saying the exact number, but just a number bigger than we're getting from GTS, which is very good. And so, the first part of the answer to your question is we're growing our GBS sales head count with the anticipation that, actually, we will not just hit the targets that Craig laid out earlier, but we will go beyond those as soon as those people get up to speed. In terms of the specific numbers there...","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Gary. The way to think about \u2013 we're at about 20% year-over-year head count in GBS frontline sellers as of the end of Q3. We'll be in that neighborhood at the end of 2018. And as Gene mentioned, one of the things that we've observed and learned and executed over the last decade or so that when we have more sellers, we actually sell more. And so, we'll be entering 2019 with the largest army we've ever had from a GBS perspective out there. We'll have more people or a higher percentage of people who have more than one year of experience, which will obviously be a help as we roll into 2019 as well. And you can back into or extrapolate the productivity required, based on where you think we're going to enter the year next year in terms of opening sales head count that would achieve that 10% target that we've laid out.","It is more than we are delivering today from a productivity perspective, but it is a fraction of what GTS is currently delivering from a productivity perspective. And as we've said in the past, there's no reason why GBS productivity shouldn't mirror GTS productivity over the long term. And so, it's a combination of, to Gene's point, we're not in this game just to hit 10% at the end of next year and 12% at the end of 2020. We believe that market opportunity is vast and enormous and untapped. And so, we're actually driving head count growth or adding head count capacity to go after that big market opportunity and accelerate our growth into the future.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up Craig. So when I look back at this year you've beaten the quarterly EPS bogey you'd set out convincingly, but the full-year numbers haven't moved a lot. I realize there's an awful lot of moving parts with the divestitures, with tax moving around and some of the below-the-line items. But your business should be quite predictable, your spending should be fairly predictable. Are we now through all the divestitures and everything? Are we now in a place where one might expect you to have some more ability to predict quarter-to-quarter the financial performance or do you expect these factors that have been moving around to continue to do that going forward? Thank you.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","So, there's a few things going on, you're right. It has been noisy from a divestiture perspective. And from a plan perspective, we've now executed on the four major divestitures that we set out to, which were businesses or assets that came over as a part of the CEB acquisition. And that's why we \u2013 in the supplemental document you'll find on our website, we've gone to great efforts to provide our investors with the \u2013 excluding divested operations, view, so you can see what the P&L really looks like down to adjusted EPS as if these businesses were never a part of Gartner. And so, we're getting into much more of a, what I'd call, normal operating environment from that perspective.","I think, Gary, with our businesses, there are different degrees of predictability associated with them. Obviously, the subscription research business is a great business and is highly, highly, highly predictable. Some of our other businesses have a little bit more variability around them. And on top of that, we haven't exactly been in a 100% stable foreign exchange environment either, which can cause numbers to go up or go down compared to what the guidance was even three months prior.","So I think you're right, your assertion is right that with a lot of noise behind us, we're now in a, I won't call it completely normal, but a more normal operating environment and the predictability of our businesses remains the same in terms of subscription-based revenue, really predictable and some of the other businesses have a little bit more variability, and we'd expect that going forward.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. So a question for you on the same-event growth and revenue attendees and contribution margin that all looked very strong. I just was hoping you could comment on what was driving that.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, Bill, basically, in our Events business, we have \u2013 we based it on the research that we have in our Research business. Clients come for that and we've been very effective at marketing those events, and obviously clients are seeing a lot of value from it. It's kind of as simple as that, great content, great marketing. And so, the clients come and get a lot of value out of it and that's why you're seeing that growth.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And again, when you see the growth because of the foundation of the business, it's not nearly as leveraged as our Research business, but obviously a lot of the costs at an event or conference are fixed to some extent. So when we have more exhibitors and more attendees, it flows through very nicely.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of fourth quarter guidance without discontinued operations, if you could give us a comment on what the assumption is in that fourth quarter guidance for both GTS CV growth and GBS CV growth to get some sense of that?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, Bill, we don't guide on the CV or CV growth. Essentially \u2013 the revenue in there is essentially an extrapolation of the Q3 ending contract value, and that just kind of runs out in the quarter. But we have historically not guided on contract value growth.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Well, thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Within the GBS segment, you indicated that business development productivity is comparable to GTS levels and that while account execs have had a slower learning curve, the pace of selling has improved from earlier quarters. Given those dynamics, can you elaborate on the factors that prevented CV growth from accelerating from the prior quarter?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Hi, George. Just to be clear, so on the \u2013 so, the BD productivity is as good as GTS. They had good BD productivity before. It wasn't like they had terrible BD productivity. And then on the AE side, what's going on is there's a fall-off in sales of legacy product and an uptick in sales of the new products. And because of the learning curve, again, that uptick wasn't as quick as the business developers, but it's proceeding well. So, the reason you're not seeing it is, the BD productivity on the legacy products was good and on the new products was good. On the AE productivity, it's been based \u2013 so that didn't change a lot. On the AE productivity, what's going on is that the AE net productivity wasn't at GTS levels. And it hasn't risen substantially so far because of the fall-off of legacy has been made up for just about equally with the increase in seat-based products.","Now, we're encouraged that over time that will turn around, because, as I mentioned, we're reducing the workload to the number of renewals that we have to see. And secondly, for the AEs that have started selling new seat-based products, their new business productivity is going up as well. It's a higher priced product and there's more additional sale opportunities.","So, it's this combination of \u2013 with the new seat-based products having higher pricing, having more additional sale opportunities, and then in addition to that, having a smaller workload in renewals, so you have more time to sell. Those are the factors that over time \u2013 it hasn't happened yet, but we can see it in the underlying numbers that where we have reduced workload, their productivity has gone up. We will continue to do that throughout 2019. We're doing it now, but we'll continue to do it through 2019. And again, for the people that have already sold their first seat-based product, they're now getting acceleration in selling the second, third, fourth, which increases their new business productivity.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. You'd indicated that GBS new business was down 6% in the quarter. What was it last quarter and how does new business need to trend in order for you to hit your double-digit CV growth target by 2019?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, George. So, in Q2, new business was down about 20% compared to the prior year. So as I mentioned on a previous question, we actually saw a nice improvement from Q2 to Q3, which is great. I think that, obviously, there's two simple levers that will allow us to get to that or three simple levers, I should say, that allow us to get to that double-digit contract value growth target for 2019.","Number one is continuing to work on and improve retention rates. And as we talked about earlier, we've seen nice progress on the GBS retention rates. However, you will note that there's still a pretty big gap between wallet retention of GBS and wallet retention of GTS, which we are intent on closing over time. So that's number one. Number two, we're going to have significantly more capacity from a selling perspective. And obviously, that will equate into more sales for us. And that will help on that path to double-digit growth.","And then, lastly, is really that new business number. And again, you look at what we're doing in GTS and you can kind of use that as a guide in terms of what kinds of new business growth is required to support double-digit and mid-teen CV growth. And so, I think we would expect to see new business growth growing at double-digit rates as well to support double-digit contract value growth from a sustainable perspective into the future.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question and it will be from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. It's Henry Chien on for Jeff. Just wanted to ask about the GTS business. So, it seems like both CV growth is really strong and you're seeing nice gains in productivity and it seems like things are really going well there. Just curious, is that a satisfying sort of level for you? You just want to keep that business at a steady pace and any upcoming investment cycles in that area that you're thinking about.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, Henry, in GTS, we're doing great. The growth rate is terrific. We're not satisfied with the growth rate. We'd like to have higher growth and we're working all the levers. So, we are continuing to work on improving retention and we believe we can continue to improve retention. And we are continuing to work on improving new business per salesperson. While it's good, we believe it can get better and we have programs to improve that. And again, we also want to grow the sales force at the rate that we believe we can productively deploy salespeople.","And as I've talked about in the past, the third lever, the rate we grow is set by the number of managers we have and what we think their capacity is to manage additional salespeople. And so, if we can increase that, meaning our management team's ability to accept more salespeople, we'd accelerate the growth rate in our head count as well. And so, we're working all three of those levers. So while, as you said, GTS CV growth and productivity is great, we're not satisfied with that. And again, our aspiration is for significantly better.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. That's great. And just in terms of the content for GTS, I know that supply chain and marketing, I know you mentioned in the past, have been good drivers for sort of accelerating that growth. Is that still the case or is there any sort of trends by the sort of product lines that you see right now?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, I think we have tremendous opportunity across all the functional areas we serve. And as we accelerate the growth in the GBS business, our expectation is all the functional areas that we serve will be healthy contributors to that acceleration in the growth rate.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will bring us to the end of our Q&A session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Hall for his closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Well, so as you heard today, we have strengthened all three of our businesses: Research, Consulting, and Events. We know the right things to do to drive success in our business by applying the Gartner Formula. Our GTS organization continues to deliver strong performance. We've put much of the foundation in place that will accelerate the learning curve for GBS, resulting in sustained double-digit growth there as well. We deliver incredible value to every major functioning enterprise. We've vast market opportunity and we're on track to deliver sustained double-digit growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flow for years to come.","Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to updating you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2015 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as other filings with the SEC. I'd encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Gene?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Sherief, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our Q1 2016 earnings call. Starting strong in the first quarter of the year is the best way to have a great full year and we had a great start to 2016. First quarter, we delivered against all of our key metrics including double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, and earnings per share. In addition, we continue to drive strong free cash flow conversion.","As many of you know, we do business in more than 90 countries around the world. Because of ongoing currency fluctuations globally, we're going to talk about our results in FX-neutral terms to give a clear understanding of how we're doing.","For the first quarter of 2016 total company revenues increased by 21% and EBITDA increased by 31%. These resulted were driven by robust performance in all three of our business segments and demand for our services remained strong.","Research is the core of our business and our largest and most profitable segment. Research revenues accelerated to 18% growth in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations. These results were driven by strong contract value growth and contributions from our recent acquisitions. Contract value growth for the first quarter of 2016 was 14%. We achieved double-digit contract value growth in every region, in almost every industry, and across every size company. Client retention was at 84% and wallet retention was 105%, which are near our all-time highs.","Our Consulting business enables us to deepen our research relationships with our largest clients. For Q1 2016 our Consulting business had one of the strongest quarters it's ever had with revenue growth of 12%. Backlog which is a leading indicator of future revenue growth for this business segment grew 17% over this time last year. And these results were a result of broad contributions from all consulting practice areas and regions.","Our Events business also achieved another strong quarter of double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2016 with revenues up 10% on a same-events basis. We hosted more than 7,600 attendees across 12 events we held in the quarter and advance bookings for events are growing at strong double-digit rates. Our results continue to reflect the tremendous value we deliver to our clients. Technology is critical to every company in the world. Every enterprise is concerned about cyber-security. Every enterprise is worried about technology disruption. And technology is the key to fuel in cost reduction, whether the enterprise is looking to find new growth initiatives or cut costs. Technology is changing everything and the rate of technology-driven change is accelerating. It will never be this slow again.","Enterprises know they need help. Gartner is at the heart of technology. Our clients rely on us for making independent objective and fact-based insights when making critical technology decisions. Our services deliver tremendous value at very high ROI, more than paying for themselves. Whether the enterprise is thriving or facing economic challenges Gartner has the insight advice our clients need to achieve success with their mission-critical priorities.","As you may have heard me say in the past, Gartner is a people business. We continue to make significant investments in attracting top talents and they're paying off. We often get recognized externally. Here's a couple of examples. Forbes named us one of their Most Innovative Growth Companies for 2015. We were also named one of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies for 2016 and there are many more.","A few weeks ago, I was with a number of our top-performing sales people. These were sales people from all around the world who had previously worked in other leading technology companies. One manager I spoke with told me, he describes a sales role at Gartner as a destination job. He said Gartner delivers tremendous value to our clients with incredible training, tools, products and services, and the Gartner name gets you access to C-level clients anywhere in the world.","You don't come to Gartner on your way to somewhere else, Gartner is the place you're trying to get to. It's not about a job, this is a place we build a career. And I get this feedback from across our sales organization and throughout our business, including Research, Events, Consulting and more. Gartner is a growth company and we continue to invest in the development of our people along with the products and services that add the most value to our clients. I remain excited for continued double-digit growth well into the future.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Craig who will provide more detail on our business results.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. At a high level, Gartner's first quarter performance reflects a continuation of the robust demand for our products and services in what remains a challenging macroeconomic environment for virtually every global business. The combination of the great value we provide to our clients around the world, the investments we are making to capture our vast market opportunity, and our exceptional business model allows us to consistently deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth as well as exceptional free cash flow generation.","Our strong Q1 results and updated full-year guidance underscores our expectation to continue this trend in 2016. On an FX-neutral basis, our year-on-year financial performance for the quarter included contract value growth of 14% and Research revenue growth of 18%, Events revenue growth of 10% on a same-event basis, Consulting revenue growth of 12% with backlog growth of 17%, normalized EBITDA growth of 31%, and diluted EPS excluding acquisition adjustments of $0.61 per share. This compares to $0.37 per share in the first quarter of 2015 and our guidance range of $0.44 to $0.47.","Our stronger than expected Q1 EPS results were driven in roughly equal amounts by the combination of improved operational performance and lower expenses below EBITDA such as stock-based compensation and tax. I will come back to this in more detail in a few moments.","As I emphasized at our recent Investor Day, our exceptional business model and focus on cash flow creates a consistently high level of free cash flow conversion. On a rolling four quarter basis, our free cash flow conversion was 147% of normalized net income at the end of Q1.","I'll now discuss our first quarter business segments performance in depth, provide some comments on balance sheet and cash flow dynamics, and then close with remarks on our guidance for Q2 and our updated outlook for the full-year. We will then be happy to take your questions.","Beginning with Research, Research revenue grew at 16% on an as-reported basis and 18% on an FX-neutral basis in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of our newest acquisitions and the foreign exchange, Research revenues were up organically by 14%. The new businesses Capterra and Nubera both performed strongly in Q1. The gross contribution margin for Research was 70% or the same level compared to the first quarter of 2015.","All of our other Research business metrics remained very strong. Total contract value was $1.721 billion as of the end of Q1, FX-neutral growth of 14% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we have made a modest adjustment to our calculation of contract value, which we believe provides better transparency and visibility into our performance. For reference and comparison, our Q1 2015 total contract value at current-year FX rates was $1.514 billion, while our Q4 2015 total contract value was $1.697 billion. You can also find this historical information in our Investor Day materials from February.","We have provided our historical research contract value measure in our press release and will continue to provide that figure for the balance of 2016, after which we will phase it out. At the end of Q1, that figure was $1.704 billion, also 14% year-over-year growth on an FX-neutral basis.","We have a highly diversified business which largely reflects the GDP composition in each country that we do business in. We sell to clients in over 90 countries around the world. We have clients in every vertical, from finance to public sector to healthcare. We have clients that are huge multinationals down to very small businesses. This diversity is a strength, particularly given the challenging macroeconomic conditions all global businesses continue to operate in, as it helps us to mitigate against challenges in any one region, any one industry, or any one size of client. Consistent with this, our growth in contract value continues to be broad-based, with every region, every client size, and virtually every industry segment growing at double-digit rates.","We continue to drive CV growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business. As Gene mentioned, client retention was 84%, down slightly from the first quarter of 2015 and flat to the end of 2015; wallet retention ended at 105% for the quarter, down modestly year-on-year but also flat on a sequential basis. Both of our retention figures are close to our historical highs. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we have discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a four-quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","New business increased 16% year-on-year in Q1. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. And as always, we also benefit from our consistent price increases. Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises. We ended the first quarter with 10,474 enterprise clients, up 6% compared to Q1 2015. Additionally, the average spend per enterprise continues to grow, reflecting our ability to increase our contract value by driving growth in both new and existing enterprises.","Turning to sales productivity. As we have detailed in the past, we calculate sales productivity as the net contract value increase, what we call NCVI, per account executive. We look at it on a rolling four-quarter basis to eliminate seasonality and we use opening sales head count as the period denominator. Over the last 12 months we grew our contract value by $207 million in FX-neutral terms. Using our Q1 2015 ending sales head count of 1,933 as our beginning of period denominator yields NCVI per AE of $107,000 on a rolling four-quarter basis, or a 7.5% decline over the first quarter last year when the comparable figure was $116,000 per account executive at constant currency rates.","The year-over-year decline in productivity was driven primarily by the deceleration of CV growth in industries and regions that continue to be most challenged. On a sequential and a standalone quarter basis, sales productivity was essentially flat as underlying improvements to productivity were offset by the tougher overall operating environment.","To sum up, we delivered another robust quarter in Research with 14% contract value growth and better than expected performance from our most recent acquisitions. Given this strong performance, we have increased our outlook for the Research business for the full year as I will discuss in a moment.","Looking forward, we are confident that the productivity initiatives we have in place and continue to introduce will positively impact contract value growth in 2016, and ultimately Research revenue growth over the longer term.","Moving to Events. On a same-events and FX-neutral basis, Events revenues increased 10% year-on-year, consistent with our full-year growth expectations. As noted last quarter, we moved three larger events into Q1 2016 that occurred in Q2 last year. In the quarter, we held 12 events with 7,640 attendees compared to nine events and 4,065 attendees in the first quarter of 2015. Events' Q1 gross contribution margin was 41%, up significantly compared to a lighter year-ago quarter, but approximately flat when compared on a same-events basis. Our outlook for Events remains unchanged. We still expect double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis for the full year.","Consulting began the year with one of its best-ever quarters. As Gene detailed, this performance was broad-based across regions and practice areas. On an as-reported basis, Consulting revenues increased 11% year-on-year and 12% on an FX-neutral basis, exceeding our own expectations for the quarter. The labor-based business was up 9% versus Q1 of last year at constant currency. We also saw very strong year-on-year growth in Q1 for our contract optimization practice.","The underlying operating metrics of our Consulting business also remain strong. On the labor-based side, billable head count of 618 was up 13% from the year-ago quarter and first-quarter annualized revenue per billable head count ended at $386,000, which was flat year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis.","Our ongoing investment in managing partners continues to drive demand for our services, and we had 110 managing partners at the end of Q1, a 15% increase over the year-ago quarter. Related to this, backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $114 million, up 17% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. This represents over four months of forward backlog. Given the strong Q1 performance and the visibility we have into the pipeline we have increased our outlook for the Consulting business for the full year, as I will discuss in a moment.","Moving down the income statement. SG&A increased by 12% year-over-year in the first quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force. As of the end of Q1, we had 2,237 direct quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 304 or 16% from a year ago, consistent with our plans for the year. In the first quarter, SG&A was 250 basis points lower as a percentage of revenues than the year-ago quarter. This was primarily due to better G&A leverage and higher revenues, which more than offset the continued investments in our sales capacity, recruiting, and training capabilities.","Moving on to EBITDA and earnings. Normalized EBITDA was $103 million in the first quarter, up 28% year-on-year on a reported basis and up 31% on an FX-neutral basis. This growth can be largely attributed to our strong operating performance. Excluding the shift in events, normalized EBITDA was up approximately 19% in the quarter. In addition, our first quarter earnings benefited from lower than expected stock-based compensation expense which also positively impacts our full year outlook for EPS.","Moving down the income statement. Depreciation, amortization and acquisition and integration charges all increased year-over-year reflecting higher capital spending to support our growth as well as the impact of our recent acquisitions. Net interest expense was $6 million in Q1 reflecting our increased borrowing. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 33.4%. This lower Q1 rate was primarily due to favorable Q1 period items as well as the timing of certain tax costs that are expected to be realized in the remainder of the year.","We expect our full-year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 36%. Adjusting for acquisition charges, our normalized tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32%, and we expect our full-year normalized tax rate to be approximately 35%. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.48 in Q1. Our GAAP EPS includes roughly $0.13 worth of acquisition and integration charges.","EPS excluding acquisition and integration charges was $0.61 per share in Q1, up 65% versus Q1 of 2015. As mentioned earlier, the largest portion of our EPS over-performance in the quarter was due to stronger operational performance in Research and Consulting; this was complemented by lower equity compensation expense and a lower than expected tax rate in the quarter.","Turning now to cash. The first quarter is seasonally the lightest quarter for the year in terms of cash flow given the combination of seasonality in our operations as well as the timing of incentive payments. For Q1, operating cash flow was $9 million compared to $6 million in the year ago quarter. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less capital expenditures with cash acquisition and integration payments added back.","In the first quarter, free cash flow was $13 million compared to $4 million in Q1 2015. This increase was driven by a combination of higher operating cash flow and lower CapEx. Consistent with the negative working capital dynamics that are a key characteristic of our subscription-based business model, we continue to generate free cash flow well in excess of net income on a rolling four-quarter basis. At the end of Q1, this equated to rolling four-quarter free cash flow of $325 million or $3.71 per share on a fully diluted basis. This represents a net income to free cash flow conversion of 147%.","Strategic acquisitions and share repurchases continue to be our primary uses of our free cash flow and available capital. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and as I have commented in the past, we continue to look for additional value creating acquisition opportunities. We also believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital.","During the first quarter we repurchased $46 million worth of shares; and as of March 31, we had approximately $1.1 billion available under our share repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, cash position and liquidity profile. As of March 31, we had gross debt of $890 million. We have $700 million of interest rate swaps in place which effectively lock in our interest rates through September 2019 on this portion of our debt. Our cash balance, as of March 31, was $404 million with 93% of our cash located outside of the U.S. The combination of our debt and cash positions represents a net debt position of $486 million or about 1.1 times normalized EBITDA.","As of March 31, we have an additional $586 million of revolver capacity; that, and our ongoing free cash flow generation, gives us ample liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive shareholder value.","Turning now to guidance. Given our stronger than expected Q1 operational performance, we have increased our outlook for 2016. Our updated 2016 guidance is for total revenues of $2.405 billion to $2.465 billion. This is FX-neutral growth of 13% to 15% and an increase of $50 million to both the low end and high end of our previous outlook.","Further details of our updated guidance are as follows: Research revenue of $1.795 billion to $1.825 billion, or 15% to 17% FX-neutral growth. We've added $10 million to the low end and high end of the guidance range to reflect the stronger Q1 performance. Consulting revenues of $335 million to $350 million, or 3% to 8% FX-neutral growth. We have also added $5 million to the low end and high end of the range to reflect a better than expected Q1 and outlook for the rest of the year. Events revenues of $275 million to $290 million, or 10% to 16% growth; this guidance is unchanged from last quarter. For normalized EBITDA, we now expect to deliver between $450 million and $480 million, or 11% to 19% growth on an FX-neutral basis. This reflects a $10 million increase to the low end and high end of the range due to our Q1 performance.","For GAAP and adjusted EPS calculations, we now expect that cost associated with stock-based compensation expense in 2016 to be approximately $47 million to $48 million compared to our previous expectation of $51 million to $52 million. As a result of the changes I just mentioned, we are also updating our GAAP EPS guidance and now expect $2.27 to $2.49 per share in 2016. This includes $0.40 per share of acquisition related charges.","Excluding acquisition and integration charges, our guidance for EPS is now expected to be between $2.67 and $2.89 per share in 2016. This represents FX-neutral growth of approximately 13% to 22%. Please note that our guidance is based on average fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 82 million shares to 83 million shares for the full-year 2016, in line with our previous guidance.","Turning to our cash flow guidance. The headline for cash flow is that we are increasing our free cash flow guidance by $7 million on both the lower and upper ends of our range, which yields free cash flow guidance of $352 million to $377 million. This new free cash flow guidance yields free cash flow per share of $4.27 to $4.57 in 2016. This equates to 15% to 23% growth when compared to the full-year 2015.","In terms of the inputs to calculate free cash flow, we now expect full year 2016 operating cash flow of $370 million to $395 million, a $20 million increase from our previous guidance range. This increase is driven by our updated EBITDA outlook and lower expected cash acquisition and integration payments. Our gross capital expenditure outlook continues to be approximately $47 million.","As I just mentioned, we now expect lower cash acquisition and integration payments in 2016, a total of $29 million compared to our previous guidance of $42 million. As in prior years, our free cash flow is expected to again be well in excess of our normalized net income in 2016. Specifically, our guidance implies that we will deliver a free cash flow conversion of approximately 150% or greater, in line with our historical range and our previous guidance.","For the second quarter of 2016, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.56 to $0.60, including $0.10 per share of acquisition and integration charges. Our Q2 guidance is impacted by the lower number of events that we expect to hold as a consequence of the shift in events that benefited the first quarter.","So before taking your questions, let me summarize. Getting off to a great start in 2016, as we demonstrated in Q1, is the best way to ensure we can deliver a strong year of growth. In Q1, we delivered 14% contract value growth. Research revenues exceeded our expectations for the quarter and our Consulting business had a great start to the year. The strong start to the year also allowed us to increase our full-year outlook, which again positions us to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and earnings growth with strong cash flow conversion.","We also continue to operate in a difficult global macroeconomic environment, but as you heard from Gene, and as our Q1 results show, we continue to deliver tremendous value to our clients whether they are thriving or are under economic stress. This gives us confidence that we can continue to grow our business in virtually any macroeconomic environment.","Demand for our services remains robust and we remain confident that the initiatives we have in place will continue to positively impact our sales force productivity. Furthermore, we continue to invest organically and through value-enhancing initiatives to capture the market opportunity ahead of us while also returning capital to shareholders. Our recent acquisitions and execution of our ongoing share repurchase program is consistent with this.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please proceed.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. I guess I just want to follow up the bookings growth of 16% is a \u2013 new business growth is up from high-single-digits the prior two quarters. So even against a tough comparison, I guess, did you \u2013 do you feel better about \u2013 you had talked on the prior calls about some challenged sectors or, I guess, what would you point to that, that drove \u2013 a pickup again in that new business growth rate?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Tim. It's Gene. So first, of course, is our sales capacity. We've continued to expand our sales capacity. And obviously, the more sales we have, the faster we grow. And if you look at the new business growth, it's kind of in line with our \u2013 the increase in our sales head count.","Now, as you also know, in addition to that, we have other things that are working at improving our new business growth; things like making sure we recruit the best people, things like making sure we give people the best tools to make them productive, and, of course, great training. So that's kind of what's behind the new business growth.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. I guess, maybe just push \u2013 on the guidance as well, given the visibility of it, at the end of the kind of calendar year to increase guidance for the Research business kind of one quarter in, I think, is a little unusual. So I guess something there had have trended better than you thought. So I guess what part of bookings or kind of the underlying activity maybe came in better than you would have thought a couple of months ago when you started the year?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Tim. It's Craig. On the raise, it's a $10 million raise on a $1.8 billion number, so a pretty modest increase. That said, two prime things. One is the acquired businesses, as I mentioned, performed better than we had anticipated and we're flowing that benefit through; and then, there's a little bit of a new business upside. Again, most of our subscription-based revenue is locked as you say, but we made a modest adjustment upwards to reflect the strength we had in Q1.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. This may be similar to the recruiting tools training that you called out. But when you're talking about improved operational performance, I know it's a continuous improvement game. But, Gene, are there two or three KPIs worth calling out where you especially saw notable improvement relative to a couple quarters ago? And then, can you just remind us when you guys are focused on getting back to margin expansion internally? What's the metric that you're most focused on? Is it adjusted EBITDA margins?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jeff. It's Gene. So first, again, the thing that drives new business growth is going to be just what you said. It's recruiting, it's training, and it's tools. And as you know, we \u2013 every quarter we make improvements in that recruiting training tools. And \u2013 so we're seeing the pay out from that kind of work. In terms of margin expansion?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. On the margin side; Jeff, I mean, we're focused obviously on the gross margin and continuing to drive improvements there. But ultimately the measure is our normalized EBITDA margin as you said.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, I don't think that you guys think it as a negative impact, I think \u2013 it may actually have a positive impact, but the question seems to be coming up more with investors, how does the secular shift towards cloud and potentially less internal IT resources impact Gartner? So I was just hoping you could address that in this forum.","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a great question, Jeff. So the shift to cloud is great for us. Any time our clients are making changes that are important to their business, it obviously drives \u2013 they want help figuring out what the right thing to do is. We are the authoritative source globally for figuring these kind of problems out. And our clients are the people that are the CIO, the Head of Security, the Head of Application Development; they're senior level clients. And so even if an organization has fewer, for example, operations people, because they've outsourced some of the data centers to the cloud or whatever, doesn't affect our key client base.","And so you have, first, the demand being driven by \u2013 the change is good for us, the cloud, because people need help; and, secondly, our clients are not the ones \u2013 if there are job changes, our clients are not the ones that are affected, because we sell to the senior level clients.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just finally, Craig, I think you broke the record for saying U.S. dollar on the last call. Just \u2013 if I could verify, is the current guidance using recent spot rates? And is there at all a meaningful change on the guidance as a result of the changes in FX since the last quarter?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. The changes since last quarter are really minimal. The way to think about foreign exchange going forward is, we're beginning to lap the big increases in the U.S. dollar that we experienced last year. And so this quarter, if you looked at it line by line, as we talked about the difference between reported and FX-neutral, it was a 1 point to 3 point impact, whereas last year it was a 6 point to 8 point impact. And so we would expect that to actually close a little bit as we go through the year.","That said, our guidance based on recent spot rates is really no different than what we gave as our original guidance at the beginning of the year.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple on margins. Could you talk about the better G&A leverage you mentioned? Craig, I believe when you first came into the CFO role, you talked about how most of the low-hanging fruit had been picked on that side. Interested to hear what drove the improvement this quarter and whether you've identified other areas of G&A efficiency since you last touched upon that?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Good morning, Anj. Thanks for the question. On the G&A leverage point, I think we've consistently \u2013 so your first question around harvesting the low-hanging fruit; yes, we did that over the last several years. That said, all the G&A functions within the company are insanely focused on being more productive and more efficient each and every year. And by virtue of that, even with the growth we have, we are growing those functions at a significantly lower rate than we're growing revenue. And that's where the G&A leverage comes from. And we believe we can continue to drive G&A leverage into the future.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, got it. And I realize it's splitting hairs to some degree, but could you help us parse out the higher Research contribution margin this quarter despite the impact of acquisitions, which I believe you've called out as having a lower margin profile?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Anj. On a year-over-year basis, the Research contribution margins were roughly flat at 70%. The acquired businesses are still small enough that they don't have a significant impact on the margins. And what I'd say is, the margins came in right around where we expected them to come in for the quarter.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And a last quick one from me, with regards to sales force productivity, last quarter you'd mentioned sort of an adjusted figure, if you could, for the energy and utility sector impact. Could you just give us that metric again? I think you had said it was modestly down even adjusting for that, interested to hear what that was on that same basis? Thank you.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. If we look at the areas that were most challenging that we've talked about over the last two quarters, if you strip those out, productivity is roughly flattish on a rolling four-quarter basis.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Ryan filling in for Manav. Just to kind of touch on the margin impact of what you're seeing in the slowdown in productivity in some of the challenged areas, you've talked a lot about, how, as productivity ramps, you'll be able to get that margin expansion. You obviously have margin expansion baked in here, but there's some commentary on productivity being difficult in this environment. So just trying to parse out how much of the productivity is kind of baked into the current guidance?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Ryan. When we guided for the year, we talked about roughly flat productivity compared to what we delivered in 2015 on an FX-neutral basis. Our Q1 results are essentially that. And so while we're a little down on a year-over-year basis, coming out of Q4 we're roughly flat to what we did last year. And that's obviously the biggest lever or one of the largest levers in terms of margin. But there are obviously other levers that can work in our benefit as well. If you look at the guidance and you extrapolate the EBITDA margins, they're roughly flat to modestly up on a full-year basis, and that's consistent with what we talked about last quarter, our previous guidance, and our current guidance obviously.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And just on the hiring side, obviously a little bit of an acceleration in the quarter. We're hearing across our space a lot of comments on the difficulty of hiring in just kind of a full employment picture. I know you guys have talked in the past about some of the tools that you use to identify people who fit with Gartner. But are you seeing any challenges at all in filling the demand for sales people, just given that \u2013 especially in the U.S. at least, the employment picture looks so strong?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a great question. As I mentioned in my little story about some of the sales people I met recently, Gartner really is a very attractive place for any of our associates, particularly in sales. And so when we go to prospective sales people and talk to them about, again, the selling environment, the training that they have, the ability to get access using our brand name, we don't have any trouble recruiting great sales people.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Fair enough. If I could just dig in one more just on the M&A environment. I know you've consistently said it's pretty broad-based. Are there any interesting new verticals? Or are you seeing conversations with potential targets changing? Are there more willing sellers, anything on that front?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I'm going to give you our usual answer which is, we track on the order of 100 companies at any one point in time. And when we see targets that look like they have great opportunities for us, we go after them. And obviously I can't talk any more specifically than that.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, guys. This is actually Patrick (39:58) in for Toni. You've talked a lot about in the past getting into supply chain and marketing. And I'm wondering if you can give us an update on your progress within those verticals?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great question. So we \u2013 as you know, our largest business is selling to IT professionals, CIOs, Chiefs of Security etcetera. We, a few years ago, entered the supply chain business and we have a business there that sells to the Chief Supply Chain Officers, Heads of Manufacturing, Heads of Distribution, to the analogous functional leaders that are in the supply chain. And we have a research team that does just supply chain research. There is some minor overlap with IT, but it's really about how do you \u2013 if you're one of these, either Chief Supply Chain Officer or Head of Manufacturing or Head of Distribution and Logistics, how do you run that as an organization. The whole concept of syndicated research is just as valuable for supply chain leaders as it is for IT leaders. And so that business has been a great business for us. It's growing even faster than our IT business, doing great and has similar economics.","Marketing, we entered into market \u2013 a similar marketing product, selling again to Chief Marketing Officers and people who are in charge of digital marketing etcetera. And most all organizations these days, even government entities often have people that are in charge of things like digital marketing. And there is the similar kind of change going on in marketing as there is in IT.","So we entered that business organically a few years ago. And again, the clients there get just as much value out of syndicated research, they have their own kinds of problems in terms of, like, how do I optimize my search engine marketing, how do I \u2013 all that kind of stuff. And so that's another business, again, growing faster than \u2013 even faster than our IT business and doing great.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks. And then just kind of a quick modeling question, if I could. I think last quarter you guys were expecting about 63 events for the year. So I'm just wondering, first, is that true; and second, given that a number of the events that were pulled into the first quarter appear to have been a little bit of higher margin, how we should think about kind of margins for the Events business in the second quarter? Thanks.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So the expectation Patrick (42:10) is still for the same roughly 63 events for the full year. Obviously, as you saw, we did move three large \u2013 and the larger events tend to be more profitable event into Q1 out of Q2. And so our expectation around Q2 events is, obviously, without those large events, that were actually nice growers as well, we'll see declining events revenue on a reported basis in Q2.","We still expect roughly double-digit growth on a same-events basis. That's obviously going to impact the margins. We don't give specific margin guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But obviously with those three large events not in Q2, we'll have an impact on the Events margins. And quite frankly, the overall company margins for the second quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. It's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to talk a bit about the latest on the revenue contribution of business development through sales of the small businesses; any evolution in how we should be thinking about your strategy and growth trajectory for those businesses that you've put together by acquisition? And now that you've bought a few of them that serve that space, are you thinking about potentially adding more?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Andre, great question. We have traditionally served a target market of the larger companies, and this universe of more than 100,000 of these companies that you can think about spend at least $10 million a year on IT. That's kind of have been our traditional target market which we serve about 11,000 out of the more than 100,000 there are today. We think there's actually, by the way, considerably more than 100,000.","Having said that, small businesses have the same kind of needs for what are the best practices of IT, what are the best products and services for those small businesses to buy, et cetera. And so there are literally tens of millions of those businesses that spend less than $10 million a year in IT. And so we've entered \u2013 we weren't really in that space until about two years ago. We've entered that space with the three acquisitions and it's a great market for us, growing nicely and contributes great to the Research business and provides great value to those clients that didn't really have that opportunity before.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then on the Consulting side, you've been pushing growth in a number of partners pretty aggressively, in line with the strategy you laid out a few years ago. Maybe provide a bit more detail on where you've seen the most success with that significant ramp versus greatest challenges? And should we expect you to maintain that pace of double-digit increase in the future years? Or could you maybe slow that now that you're above the hundred you pegged a few years ago?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So as you pointed out, in our Consulting business, building a strong cadre of managing partners is a core part of the strategy for that business. We've been doing it over several years. We've gotten now to where we actually have a critical mass of managing partners. And we're finding that it's working, if anything, better than we even expected, exceeding our expectations, doing great. We not only have \u2013 there's two factors there. One is that we have more of them, but also they're individual, I will call it, productivity has exceeded our expectations. And we think that there's room to continue to add managing partners on a go-forward basis at kind of a similar rate to we've done in the past.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess just three really clean up questions. Why did the acquisition integration cash charges go down so much? Is that a difference in the earn-out payments or what created that? Thanks.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Gary. It's Craig. It's a great question. The truth is no change really in the payments that were going out the door. It was actually a balance sheet classification change. And so, in effect, we had funded this year's outflow at time of acquisition. It was still sitting on our balance sheet. And \u2013 so the cash had already gone out in effect. And all we've done is reflect the fact that we had actually funded that out of cash flow two years ago when we did the deal and we had mistakenly assumed they would actually flow out of our cash flow balance.","So really no change in the economics, no change in the contractual terms, just a balance sheet classification; and the effect was there was no impact on free cash flow. So the reason why we took up \u2013 cash flow up in part was because there was no going out from that payment since it has already gone out, and then there was no add-back since it hadn't gone out. So I apologize if that was a circular convoluted complex answer, but that's the best way I can explain it.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So basically you had underrepresented what the true cash flow was when you initially gave the guidance because of that, because of what you just explained?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. Again, Gary, the free cash flow was unchanged. It was really a balance sheet classification thing.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then I want to push back on the FX a little bit. Obviously, you've never disclosed exactly what the bucket is, but you say 90 countries. If I look at the trade weighted dollar, it's moved hard since you last reported and gave the first 2016 guidance. And it would imply just, year-over-year, assuming rate stayed where they are now FX benefits the third quarter, call it, 0.5 point and fourth quarter more than 1 point. And so is there \u2013 is it just given the volatility there you're not willing to flow that through? Or is there something going on? Or is your mix very different from the trade weighted dollars?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not completely familiar with the trade weighted dollar, so I can't really talk to that. All I can tell you is, obviously, we know the mix of our business and we run it through all of our models assuming the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the end of the quarter. But one thing I'd also say is, the initial guidance we gave was actually based on foreign exchange rates at the beginning of February, not the end of December. So there may be a little bit of a dislocation between end of year and when we gave our initial guidance.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then just a last one, the pace of buybacks has slowed pretty materially over the last three quarters. Is that just because of the acquisitions last summer or is there anything else changing relative to \u2013 I guess, on an LTM basis, it's roughly half the $400 million or so a year that you have been targeting. But is that just M&A expense instead of buybacks for a little while or is there something else going on? Thanks.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Gary, the way we think about it, obviously, the amount of buyback on a quarter-by-quarter basis does bounce around and there is not \u2013 nor is there by design consistency around the pace of repurchasing. I guess what I tell you is when we look at capital deployment, it's the same story, we continue to have two priorities: strategic acquisitions that drive value for our shareholders, and that followed by share repurchases. Over the last two years, we've deployed over $1.2 billion on the combination of strategic value enhancing acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.","We are still very, very focused on deploying our capital to drive value for shareholders and again it's going to be through that combination of strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you. I appreciate it guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. So, Craig, this margin performance was really impressive and I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you quantify what portion of the year-to-year improvement is the timing issue versus sort of underlying fundamental improvement in business dynamics?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Peter. I think the way to think about the margin expansion on the quarter is, the bulk of it is actually due to the moving of events. So obviously not having them in the quarter last year compared to having those three large profitable events in the quarter this year moves the needle on EBITDA margin. I think the way to think about the business is look at the full-year outlook and look at the assumed EBITDA margins based on the low, mid and high point of our guidance, and that's the way we're thinking about the margin expansion.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Got it. So I think at the midpoint of the range, if I'm doing this right, it looks like about 30 basis points of year-to-year margin improvement, which \u2013 I don't know \u2013 is that sort of just rounding error or is that fundamental improvement in business dynamics?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So your math is correct. The midpoint is 19.1%. As we've said, Peter, we are very, very focused on continuing to invest to drive growth in the business. We're going to continue to do that. We do expect to drive gross margin leverage over the long term just based on the continued shift in mix to our more profitable Research business. And that's really the prime focus. We're delivering great profitability and great profit growth. But again, we are primarily laser-focused on continuing to invest to drive really super organic growth for the top line.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. Understood. And then last thing, the 16% increase in first quarter sales organization, should we think about that in terms of the pace for the balance of the year? Do you dial that up or down in the context of trying to drive the productivity numbers?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Peter. It's Gene. So we've given you kind of our aspirations to grow our sales head count 15% to 20% a year. We absolutely, as you say, drive it up or down based on what we see in sales productivity. So if we see an area, for example, where we have some operational issues to address whatever \u2013 we're not going to \u2013 we're going to hold the sales force growth there until we get those operational issues addressed. Conversely, we have places that are doing really well; we'll be accelerating the growth there.","So if you look at our sales teams, we have large sales teams that are growing on the order of 25% a year, and then \u2013 where things are really doing operationally great. We have other sales teams that are growing low single digits, because we have work to do operationally. And so that's \u2013 again, we expect it to be in the range of 15% to 20%, and it's based on what operational impacts we're seeing.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Yeah. Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. My first question here is just on the Consulting business. I was wondering, is there any larger projects driving the opportunity there? And anything we should read into the sustainability of a pickup in demand in Consulting?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, it's Gene. So in Consulting the \u2013 part of our consulting strategy has been over time \u2013 and this has been over a period of years \u2013 to drive into larger projects. But it's not like four times larger, or \u2013 it's basically to make the projects a little larger each year, the average project size. And we do that because it's a better way to add value to our clients and it helps with our economics as well.","So there's nothing this quarter that sort of \u2013 there's nothing out of trend with that this quarter, in terms of did we get like three large projects that accounted for it, or something like that. It's actually just part of a steady change over time of getting larger projects. And we said that the projects are still pretty small compared to what you might think about as a consulting organization. In terms of \u2013 go ahead.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","No, thought you were going to answer it. I cut you off. Go ahead.","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Go ahead, Joe, your second question.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah. So I was just wondering, how's the sustainability of the momentum there?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we have a very clear strategy in the Consulting business, which is to make sure it's an extension of research for those clients that want to have more in-depth help than they get either reading documents or with a half-hour phone call with an analyst. Obviously, it's very valuable to \u2013 there's a segment of clients for whom it's very valuable. And so we've been adding \u2013 that's part of our strategy.","In addition to that, it's having a little larger engagement each year in terms of supporting that strategy, and then having \u2013 growing our cadre of managing partners so that we have an ability to have managing partners that can directly work with those clients.","All of those things are, I think, bode well for the long-term growth of the business, and it's part of the reason we've seen this uptick in the last couple of quarters in the bookings \u2013 the backlog growth as well as the revenue growth.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. Excuse me. And it looked like the Research revenue per enterprise went up, but the client growth might have slowed just a little bit. How do you reconcile, I guess, those two metrics? It looked like it picked up obviously significantly. So I'm just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on that.","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So \u2013 first, one of our strategies is clearly to sell more to our existing clients. As for our growth, we grow through two ways. One is selling new enterprises and the second is selling more to our existing clients. If we sell more to our existing enterprises, then obviously that's going to grow and we've had a very good track record of doing it. We've had a sustained track record of doing that over many years, which continued into Q1.","We saw one thing that was a little unusual in Q1 for us, which is we had more of our smaller clients being \u2013 significantly more \u2013 being a part of mergers and acquisitions in Q1 than we have seen, if you compare it to any, actually any time since we've been reporting this data.","And so part of \u2013 if you saw the number of enterprises went down, I'm sorry \u2013 didn't grow as fast as you might have expected, it is primarily driven by the fact that there was more M&A activity sort of out of trend than we've seen in the past, which \u2013 obviously, that drives the number of enterprises' growth rate not as fast.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And then the last one from me, just on the Events business. I know three got pulled forward and you've talked a little bit about the margins in that business. How should we think about \u2013 I think you also gave the aggregate amount of events \u2013 but how should we think about the events themselves and how they fall, I guess, in the next three quarters?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Joe. Good morning. It's Craig. The outlook for the business is unchanged from the beginning of the year. We still expect 10% to 16% FX-neutral growth for the full year. Obviously, Q2 will look a little wonky due to the pull-forward of events. But as Gene mentioned in his opening remarks, advance bookings on Q2 and Q3 and Q4 events all look very positive and support this trend. And so, again, this is a great business. It's grown really, really well over the last several years, and we expect it to continue to contribute double-digit growth rates for 2016.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. So a question for you on sales force productivity. You mentioned it being flat sequentially, which I think is impressive given the growth in the head count. And I was going to ask what needs to happen for us to see that increase again? Is it really a question of timing in terms of cycling against some of the weakness we saw earlier? And then, along those lines, I was going to ask if you've seen any improvement in some of the softer verticals specifically energy given the relative improvement in the oil prices?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we are very focused on sales productivity. As you've heard me talk about before and as I talked even earlier today about \u2013 it's driven by making sure we hire people that have the right fit to sell Gartner's product line, making sure we have \u2013 give them great training, and making sure we give them world-class tools. And those \u2013 all those aspects are improving; all three of those, we improve every single quarter.","And I think on \u2013 all other things being equal, they would \u2013 in fact, if you look internally, all other things being equal, our sales productivity would grow up.","On the other side of that is \u2013 as Craig pointed out earlier, the macroeconomic situation in the world isn't that great. And so we're kind of having \u2013 if we look at the internal metrics, if all other things being equal, our productivity would have gone up, but there are a lot of places in the world today that are challenging. And that's sort of compensating for that, which is giving us that flat productivity.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I just had a question about M&A, and historically what's happened when you've had two customers combined? Does it really matter in terms of how they view spending on your product? Do you end up potentially with less or even potentially with more, or does it not factor in at all?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you hit the nail on the head there, which is what happens \u2013 different things happen depending on the circumstances. So if a company is buying another company, because they are buying a new product area they want to invest in, then actually we might end up with an accelerated growth rate from a contract value from that company.","By the way the client count would go down, one, the enterprise count will go down, but our CV growth, so it actually happens that our CV growth would go up in that kind of circumstance.","Unfortunately, there are other circumstances where one company buys another, they lay off half the people. And in some cases, those half \u2013 the people get laid off are our clients, like \u2013 I'll give you an example, if one company buys another and they don't hold as a separate unit, they may have just one CIO, and so we used to have two CIOs as clients, now we only have one CIO as a client. And that works for all the other functions as well. So when we have M&A, it definitely puts our number of enterprises client count, our contract value can go up or go down depending on the type of acquisition it is. And we \u2013 again, we see a good mix of both of those. It's not kind of like 90% one or the other. There's a good mix of both growth and shrinkage.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then last question for you on the Consulting business, the utilization has been running in the high 60%s. Is that \u2013 should we think about that as the kind of the cap on that going forward or do you think that you can raise that over time and how would you do it?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we're very happy with the level of utilization we have in Consulting. Having said that, we think we can continue to make operational improvements that will over time drive that up by modest amounts each year.","So again, we've got great economics of utilization we have \u2013 but again, we think there are modest improvements. There are changes in the business that will give us modest improvement to utilization each year and it has to do with things like \u2013 we talked early about deal size, the larger a deal is, the higher your utilization \u2013 all other things being equal, the higher utilization. The more we have constant client relationships, which are driven by managing partner strategy, the higher the utilization is in for the same size, average contract size.","So those are kind of ideal sort of levers that you get that we think over time will drive modest improvements in our Consulting utilization. Again, we're happy with the utilization today there as well.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much for the insight.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Gene Hall for closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks again for joining us today on today's call. And as you heard, we had a very strong Q1 and our updated guidance for 2016 demonstrates that we're very bullish about our ability to continue delivering double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow conversion over the long term. And we're in an enviable position as an organization. We have more impact on IT end-users and technology providers than any other company in the world: cyber security, disruption, operational efficiencies, technology is affecting every single enterprise. And we provide similar values as we discussed in the call to our clients in supply chain digital marketing. This gives us a vast market opportunity.","We have a powerful value proposition of winning strategy. We operate in varying macroeconomic climates around the world and we know how to deliver intrinsic value whether our clients are in distress or they're thriving. We know the right things to do to be successful and we're doing them.","As I mentioned at the beginning of the call and as you heard from Craig, having a strong first quarter is the best way to deliver strong performance for the full-year. And with our strong Q1 performance and increased guidance, we're off to a great start and we look forward to updating you on our next earnings call.

I will now turn the conference over to Gene Hall. Please go ahead, sir.","Eugene A. Hall","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first earnings call for 2015. Well we are doing great as a company. We're where we expected to be at this point in the year and all of our underlying metrics are strong. I will review all of our operating metrics on an FX neutral basis. For the first quarter of 2015 contract value accelerated to 15% and total company revenues grew 12%. We achieved double-digit contract value growth in every region, every industry and every company size. The continued successful execution of our proven strategy was central to our success. The momentum we saw in 2014 continued into 2015, and we continue to get bigger, stronger faster every year.","Across our three businesses, Research, our largest and most profitable segment, grew both revenues and contract value 15% in the first quarter of 2015, continuing our 19-quarter trend of double digit contract value growth. Retention was strong. For the first quarter of 2015 enterprise client retention was at 85%, up one point for the same quarter of 2014. Enterprise wallet retention was 106%, which is up two points over Q1 2014. Our retention metrics remain at all-time highs.","Sales productivity remained strong. For Q1 sales productivity was up 12%, compared to Q1 2014. We continue to invest in opportunities that will drive further advancements in this area. Our labor-based Consulting was up 5%, while our contract optimization returned to historic norms as expected, which was down compared to the exceptional year we had in 2014.","Our Events business also delivered a strong first quarter. In Q1, 2015 we drove a revenue increase of 11% year-over-year and attendee growth of 20%. As with other global companies, the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted our reported results which Craig will detail in a moment. We continue to deliver value back to our shareholders through share repurchase. Year-to-date we repurchased over $400 million in outstanding shares. And with the previous authorization fully exhausted we are excited to announce a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion.","Another reason our business is so successful is our people. At the heart of it, Gartner is a people business. We are attracting the best talent in the industry, in strategic locations around the world and getting them up to speed quickly. I recently spent a few days meeting with our top performing sales associates from around the world, and they have never been more excited about the technology revolution and our opportunity. Our sales associates consistently report that our clients value our services for whether they are growing or facing budget cuts. We continue to invest in our sales force to further capture our vast market opportunity and we know how to drive improvements in sales productivity.","Our industry-leading analysts coupled with the world-class products and services and strong sales capabilities have driven our consistently strong results. We ended 2014 in a great position, and we carried that momentum into 2015. I couldn't be more excited about Gartner. The insights we create, the advice we deliver and the overall experience for our customers has never been better. We add tremendous value to our clients, whether they're growing or facing economic challenges, and we know how to be successful in any economic environment.","Retention rates remain at all-time highs. We had double digit growth in every region, every industry and every company size and our operating metrics have never been better and we remain committed to enhancing shareholder value through investing in our business, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. We are better, stronger, faster as a company and I expect to see robust growth for years to come.","With that I would like to hand the call over to Craig.","Craig Safian","Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. Gartner's first quarter continued the growth in momentum we experienced over the course of 2014 with accelerating growth in contract value and ongoing improvements to our retention metrics. Our performance in Q1 puts us where we expected to be and we are reiterating our previously issued full year guidance which I will discuss in detail in a few minutes.","Our Q1 performance highlights are as follows: FX neutral contract value growth once again accelerated, achieving 15% growth for the quarter and retention rates matched our all-time highs. Our Events business increased revenues by 11% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. As we expected, Consulting revenues were impacted by lower contract optimization revenues and declined by 3% on an FX neutral basis for the quarter. Demand for our services was robust across all of our business segments in the first quarter. Our business continues to deliver strong growth, quarter after quarter, year after year. We are engaged on our clients\u2019 most important initiatives and projects.","The consistency of our strong retention metrics demonstrates the value and importance our clients receive from our products and services. In both existing and prospect accounts we are finding new IT, supply chain and marketing professionals to sell to everyday. We remain confident that we will continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance over the long term. And we continue to drive shareholder value through our share repurchase program. In the first quarter we spent $324 million on share repurchases and as of earlier this week, we had spent well over $400 million year-to-date, fully utilizing our $800 million authorization. As a result we announced in today's earnings release that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.2 billion share repurchase program.","I will now provide a review of our three business segments for the first quarter and will end with the details of our outlook for the second quarter and remainder of 2015 before taking your questions. But before doing to so I do want to note that the strengthening U.S. dollar has continued to impact our reported results. Just about every currency we operate in is weaker against the U.S. dollar when compared to last year. I will address the impact of foreign exchange in each business segment as I speak about them.","Starting with our Research business. Research revenue grew 9% on an as-reported basis and 15% on an FX neutral basis in the first quarter. Acquisitions from 2014 added approximately two points to our organic growth rate in Q1. The contribution margin for Research was 70% in the first quarter, matching our gross contribution margin target for this segment. The other key Research business metrics also remained strong. Contract value grew to $1.562 billion, a growth rate of 11% year-over-year on a reported basis and 15% on an FX neutral basis. This reflects continued acceleration from the last several quarters, when our FX neutral contract value growth ranged between 12% and 14%. As has been true in just about every quarter over the past several years our growth in contract value in Q1 was extremely broad-based with every region, every client size and every industry segment growing at double digit rates.","As we discussed at Investor Day, we revalue our contract value each year based upon then prevailing FX rates. We do this to provide better transparency and FX neutral comparability for this important measure. Our December 2014 ending contract value at current year FX rates was $1.550 billion and our Q1 2014 CV was $1.363 billion. The acceleration in our contract value growth was driven by improvements to both our retention rates and our new business.","Client retention ended the quarter at 85%, up a point versus the same quarter of last year and maintaining the historical high we achieved in Q4 2014. Wallet retention ended at 106% in the first quarter, a two point uptick over last year's first quarter. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in wallet retention. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retain a higher percentage of our larger clients. To eliminate seasonality, our retention metrics are reported on a rolling four quarter basis.","New business again increased significantly year-over-year, up 20% over last year's first quarter. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remained balanced between sales and new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. Our contract value growth also continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting. We have increased our prices by 3% to 6% every year since 2005 and we will do it again in 2015.","We also continue to see strong volume growth in our new business. This reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises. As a result we ended the quarter with 9,837 client enterprises, up 8% over last year's first quarter. Our average spend for enterprise continues to increase on an FX neutral basis, again reflecting our ability to grow our contract value by driving growth in both new and existing enterprises. We have also continued to see improvements to our sales productivity. Our year-over-year comparisons have been impacted by foreign exchange, so we will provide you with the FX neutral results for comparability as well.","As we\u2019ve detailed in the past we calculate sales productivity as the net contract value increase, what we call NCVI per account executive. We look at it on a rolling four quarter basis to eliminate seasonality and we use opening sales head count as the period denominator. Over the last 12 months, we grew our contract value by $199 million in FX neutral terms. Using our Q1, 2014 ending sales headcount of 1,698 as our beginning period denominator, yields NCVI per AE of $117,000 on a rolling four quarter basis, a 12% improvement over first quarter last year, when the comparable figure was $104,000. Our Q1 2015 productivity is roughly flat to Q4, 2014 on an FX neutral basis.","To sum up we delivered another strong quarter in our research business. Contract value growth accelerated to 15% as we expected. We continue to see strong demand from clients, our retention rates remain at all-time highs and we anticipate continued accelerate in productivity, contract value and revenue growth over the long term.","Turning now to Events, the first quarter is a historical light quarter for our Events business and the FX impact to this segment was magnified by the fact that eight of the nine Events held in the quarter occurred outside of the U.S. and generated revenues in currencies impacted by the strengthened U.S. dollar. On an FX neutral basis, Event's revenues increased 11% year-over-year, and the operating metrics remained very strong. During the quarter, we held nine events with 4,065 attendees compared to eight events with 3,394 attendees in the first quarter of 2014. On a same event and FX neutral basis, Events revenues grew 9% with 3,805 attendees, a 12% increase compared to first quarter of last year.","The gross contribution margin for Events of 18% for Q1 decreased roughly three percentage points from the first quarter a year ago, again reflecting the FX impact of having eight of the nine events outside of the U.S. and the fact that, it is a very small events quarter. The underlying metrics of our Events business remained strong and the business is well positioned to deliver another year of FX neutral double-digit revenue growth in 2015.","Moving on to Consulting; on a reported basis, revenues in Consulting decreased 9% in the first quarter as we expected. This result was driven by a combination of FX impact and the return to historical norms in our contract optimization business. In the quarter, on an FX neutral basis, our labor based business grew by 5%, while total consulting revenues decreased 3%, reflecting the impact of the return to more normal trending in our contract optimization business.","The underlying operating metrics of our Consulting business are also very strong. On the labor based side, billable head count of 547 was up 7% from the first quarter of 2014. First quarter utilization was 67%, a three point improvement over first quarter of last year. And annualized revenue per billable head count ended the quarter at $404,000, a 1% FX neutral improvement over Q1 of last year. As we have discussed in the past, our contract optimization practice has more variability than the other parts of our Consulting business. In last year's first quarter we saw exceptionally high performance from this part of the consulting business. In Q1 2015 we returned to our historical norms which impacted the year-over-year comparison metrics on both revenues and gross contribution for Consulting.","Across the entire Consulting business we continue to see strong demand for our services and our strategy of investing in managing partners is allowing us to capture that demand. We now have 96 managing partners, an increase of 14% from a year ago. Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $101 million. Backlog was also impacted by FX rates and still represents a healthy four months of coverage. With the current backlog and visibility we have into the pipeline we believe the Consulting business remains well positioned for 2015.","Moving down the income statement, SG&A increased by $25 million year-over-year during the first quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force. As of March 31, we had 1,933 quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 235 or 14% from a year ago. For the full year, we expect to grow the sales force by roughly 15%. In the first quarter, SG&A was higher as a percent of revenues due to Q1 being one of our seasonally smaller revenue quarters as well as continued investments in our sales capacity and recruiting and training capabilities.","Moving on to earnings, normalized EBITDA was $81 million in the first quarter, a 5% decrease year-over-year on a reported basis. Normalized EBITDA, excluding the impact of FX increased 3% in the quarter. It is important to note that our Q1 EBITDA was affected by two primary items, both of which we included in our guidance. First, the roughly eight-point impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, and second, as I just mentioned, Q1 of 2014 was an exceptionally strong quarter for our contract optimization business. As expected, that business returned to more historical norms in the current quarter. Absent those two items EBITDA growth would have been approximately 9% in the first quarter.","GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.32, within the guidance range we provided to you in February. Our Q1, 2015 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes $0.05 in amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions. Excluding acquisition-related charges, our normalized EPS was $0.37 in the first quarter. As you would expect FX and the anticipated return to historical norms in our contract optimization business impacted our EPS results as well. Our first quarter EPS figures were impacted by foreign exchange in two primary ways, first the impact on EBITDA that I just mentioned and second the impact on our tax rate for the quarter. As we have discussed in the past, our tax rate is sensitive to the mix of geographic earnings, with the stronger U.S. dollar, the proportional mix of geographic earnings from higher tax jurisdictions caused the effective tax rate to increase. Our tax rate for Q1 is within the guidance range we discussed last quarter.","Turning now to cash, operating cash flow decreased to $6 million during the first three months of 2015 versus $16 million in the same period a year ago largely due to a stronger U.S. dollar and higher incentive and tax payments in the first quarter. The first quarter is seasonally the lightest of the year for operating cash flow and we still expect to achieve the guidance we set for the full year. During the first quarter, we continued to utilize our cash to return value back to shareholders through share repurchases. In the quarter we repurchased over 4.1 million shares and we used approximately $324 million of cash for share repurchases. Through this week, we have spent well over $400 million, fully utilizing our $800 million authorization.","We are pleased to announce a newly approved $1.2 billion share repurchase program which will allow us to continue to deliver value back to our shareholders in a consistent and effective way. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position, despite the more aggressive pace of share repurchases. As of March 31, we had gross debt of $665 million and cash of $282 million, with 96% of our cash balance located outside of the U.S. Importantly, this now represents a net debt position of $383 million. As you know, we\u2019ve put an expanded credit facility in place in December of 2014. This runs through 2019 and gives us ample liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive shareholder value. As of March 31 we had $832 million available on our revolver. We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We also continue to believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital.","Turning now to the guidance, as you saw in our press release our guidance remains unchanged from February. Q1 is a lighter quarter for us, but our performance was as expected, which allows us to reiterate our previously issued guidance. Our 2015 guidance still expects total revenues of $2.150 billion to $2.205 billion. This is FX neutral growth of 12% to 15%. Projected revenues by segment on an as-reported basis can be found in our press release.","On an FX neutral basis our guidance remains as follows: Research revenue to be up 14% to 16% versus the prior year; Consulting revenue to be flat to up 6% over 2014. This guidance again assumes that the contract optimization practice within Consulting returns to its historical levels of revenue, which is negatively impacting the Consulting guidance. We expect the labor based portion of Consulting to grow in the mid-single-digits; and Events revenue to be up 11% to 18% over 2014. We still expect EBITDA growth of 10% to 17% over 2014, on an FX neutral basis. Our GAAP EPS guidance remains $2.11 to $2.30 per share. While we now anticipate a lower share count from our accelerated repurchase activity in Q1 and Q2, we also expect higher interest and other costs. While the accelerated pace of repurchases, including incremental interest expense, benefits our 2015 outlook, our projected EPS remained within our original guidance range, which is why we have reiterated our EPS guidance as well.","As a reminder, GAAP EPS includes $0.16 to $0.17 per share of acquisition-related charges for the full year of 2015. Our guidance for EPS excluding acquisition and integration charges is to be between $2.27 and $2.46 per share, FX neutral growth of approximately 7% to 16% over 2014. For the upcoming second quarter we expect GAAP EPS of $0.56 to $0.60, including $0.04 per share of acquisition and integration charges. Our Q2 guidance is impacted by foreign exchange rates, a higher projected tax rate and the return to trend for our contract optimization business. Since we gave our original guidance in early February, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen. Our current guidance takes into account the most recent foreign exchange rates.","So before taking your questions, let me is summarize. We delivered strong results for the seasonally light first quarter of 2015. Demand for our services is robust and as a result, our research contract value growth rate accelerated again, up to the 15%. Our key business metrics remain strong and in fact many, most notably retention, CV growth and sales productivity continued to improve or are at or near all-time highs, and we continue to actively explore strategic alternatives for deploying our cash. Going forward, we will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisitions and return capital to shareholders through our newly authorized $1.2 billion share repurchase program. Finally with double digit growth in contract value in the first quarter of 2015 we remain well positioned to deliver another strong year of revenue and earnings growth.","Now I will turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Please proceed.","Timothy McHugh","Yes, thank you. I guess, first on sales force productivity. I think your original guidance was - had assumed kind of flat to, I think you said marginally up. You seem to be off obviously to a good start in Q1. Can you update, I guess, how it's trending relative to your annual expectations and is that still how you're thinking about the year? And maybe dive into I guess, where you saw productivity improve or what the driver was of that?","Craig Safian","Sure, thanks Tim. On the productivity front, we are up 12% on an FX neutral basis versus Q1 of last year. We are essentially flat to where we ended the year, ended 2014 and so it's consistent with what we had laid out at Investor Day in terms of an expectation of roughly flat productivity. That being said, as you can imagine we are working very, very hard to make sure that we can continue to improve that productivity on a go-forward basis.","Timothy McHugh","Okay, and then the buyback, you have been aggressive the last few years, but you stepped up the pace certainly to a much bigger level, I guess early this year. Can you talk - what changed --what made you get that much more aggressive on the buyback?","Craig Safian","Tim, we've had had a strategy that we have talked about where acquisitions being first priority, buyback being second priority for us from a capital deployment perspective. We mentioned that our target for 2015 was to extinguish the share repurchase authorization or the remaining share repurchase authorization that we had heading into the year. Based on everything we were looking at, based on our cash flow generation, based on our balance sheet flexibility, and capacity under the revolver we determined that it would be a good thing to accelerate over the first quarter and the half of the year. So, we have essentially hit our full year target as of earlier this week.","Timothy McHugh","Do you have a - so, I guess how should we think about the rest of the year then? What's a - do you have a new full year target I guess, that we should have in mind?","Craig Safian","So the way we are thinking about it, Tim is, with the new $1.2 billion authorization we believe that will last us between 2.5 years to three years. And as always, we will look at the market in terms of what's out there from an acquisition perspective or other ways for us to deploy capital. But all other things being equal, we believe that we will use the $1.2 billion over the next 2.5 years to three years.","Timothy McHugh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Meuler from R.W. Baird. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Meuler","Yeah, good morning. So I know sometimes us analysts think that sales force head count growth is just a cell in a model and it is much more complicated than that in terms of a bottom up build. But it sounds like pretty much every KPI is favorable right now and sale force headcount growth, I think it was 14%. You are expecting 15% for the year which would still be towards the lower end of the targeted long-term range, so I guess Gene, what's the current thought on that to growing it even faster?","Craig Safian","Hi, Jeff. So the - as you pointed out our sales force - the target range for our sales force growth is 15% to 20%. We determine where we are in that range basically by looking bottoms up, which sales managers have the capacity in their particular territories and their experience level to handle that growth. And we are very confident we're going to be in that range of 15% to 20% this year.","Jeffrey Meuler","Well, Let me just - so, but you are going to be towards the lower end of the range, and I think your retention among your sales managers is good and I think that you have training programs that you have been working on. So I guess at what point do you think that maybe you drift towards the midpoint or higher of the range? What's the current bottleneck on the management training or capacity or recruitment or whatever it is?","Craig Safian","So like everything in our business, we aim to have continual improvement in it and acceleration. The things that determine that the level of sales force is obviously recruiting capacity, we think we're in good shape there, the amount of experience and tenure of our management team which as you said, we have very little turnover among our managers. And it's just doing an assessment individually - the individual territories kind of where that adds up. Again as we look at that and the development of our manager, we see that accelerating over time.","Jeffrey Meuler","Got it, and then Craig, just for modeling purposes, within consulting on a quarterly basis, which quarters are the tough comps for contract optimization? Is it Q1 and Q3, which were the quarters that you had a stronger overall consulting growth in or any other quarters to call out for a tough CO Comp?","Craig Safian","Yes. It's actually Q1 and Q2 Jeff are the two tough quarters from a comparability perspective. Q3 and Q4 our expectation is, will be roughly in line with what we did last year.","Jeffrey Meuler","Okay, and then the Q2 EPS guidance that you gave 0.56 to 0.60, just to verify, is that a GAAP number or is that an adjusted EPS number?","Craig Safian","My apologies for not being clear. That is a GAAP number which includes roughly $0.04 of acquisition integration charges.","Jeffrey Meuler","That's helpful. Thank you, guys.","Eugene A. Hall","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Anjaneya Singh","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess first off the growth rate in the consulting billable head count, it seems to be about the highest we have seen in nearly two years. Could you just help us think about that, are you seeing greater demand for your consulting services and if so, when can we expect this to show up in your consulting revenue growth?","Craig Safian","Hey Anj. How are you? So yeah, the growth in billable head count was a little higher than we\u2019ve typically seen. Some of that is driven by the managing partner growth which we\u2019ve talked about is a strategic imperative for us. That was up 14% year-over-year. What's allowed us to go a little bit faster on the billable head count growth is the combination of the quality of the backlog and the quality of the forward-looking pipeline. We generally only hire when we have visibility and we've had better visibility in that business, which largely stems from the benefits we're getting from the managing partner investment. And so as we get better visibility, higher quality backlog, et cetera, rolling forward that allows us to invest in growing the billable head count with more confidence.","Anjaneya Singh","Got it. That's helpful. Also you guys used to give out a client organizations number, is there a reason why you didn't provide that this quarter? And if you could just help us understand how much of your growth is coming from new clients versus existing client penetration, is it still roughly 50\/50? If you could just update us on that?","Eugene A. Hall","Sure. So on your first question, on the client organization number. As we talked about last year, we believe that number of client enterprises is actually a better way and more transparent way to provide what's actually happening with our client count, where a company equals an enterprise, whereas in client organizations it was buying centers, where a company could have multiple buying centers. And so, over the last year we\u2019ve provided both metrics, but we said on a go forward basis, we are going to focus just on the enterprise number which again we believe is a better number. And then also our Retention metrics are now tied to that enterprise number as well.","Your second question again? I am sorry, Anj.","Craig Safian","New business versus existing.","Anjaneya Singh","If you could just help us...","Eugene A. Hall","Right the new business?","Anjaneya Singh","Yeah.","Eugene A. Hall","Yeah. So the way to think about the new business mix is, it is historically been this way and it looked this way in the quarter as well. It comes - it falls about a third, a third, a third. So, a third of it comes from upgrades and new services to existing clients. A third comes from further penetration within existing clients and a third comes from net new logos.","Anjaneya Singh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I was wondering, could you give us some idea of how, I know we went through sort of the sales force training and you set up a facility, but how much has that been extended into other regions. Do you have a sense of what percentage of new employees are now going through the sales force training program?","Eugene A. Hall","Yeah Joe, its great question. It's Gene. The - that sales force training program that we talked about is important in driving sales force productivity. And to your point, we've now rolled up, to where all of our new sales people globally are getting that new training program. And we're quite optimistic.","Joseph Foresi","Great. So having said, I mean just on that question, how long do you think it takes, I mean what - how long do you think it takes to reach sort is of having a full turnover on the sales force so everyone has gone through the program at least once? Is that a 12 month to 18 month period?","Eugene A. Hall","So we don't take our experienced sales people back through that program. And our sales force turnover is actually pretty good. We don't lose sales people. We lose sales people really, at a very competitive rate. And so because we are only taking new sales people through it, it will take some time before everybody has that - has gone through that. And we have separate things we do with our existing sales people to improve their productivity. So this is the whole point is that this program itself is oriented for towards when we hire new people, making sure they get up to speed as quickly as possible and that they actually wind up with higher average productivity over the course of their career.","Joseph Foresi","All right, okay. And then it sound like new sales is a big contributor to the contract value growth. Can we get an idea of what those new sales are? What is the consistency of those new sales are? In other words, are those more geared toward some of the newer technologies that are out there and are those clients any different than your standard clients?","Eugene A. Hall","So the new enterprises that we are selling really aren't different than our existing enterprises. As we\u2019ve talked about at Investor Day, we see about 110,000 enterprises that we can target, that we do target actually, and of those only about 10,000 are clients today. And so our mission is every year to add a few hundred more of those enterprises. And as Craig pointed out, that's a portion of our growth. We also then have another portion of our growth which is selling more toward existing enterprises and we are very successful at that as well.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. And then the last one from me. We're talking about contract optimization again, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that it returns to historical norms. Can you just remind us what those norms are and how long this could - how long this could make - how long it would take for all this to make you its way into the numbers and what we should be expecting there?","Craig Safian","Yeah, so it is really based on last year, it's really a Q1 and Q2 phenomenon. So, we'll feel the impact of the return to historical norms most notably in Q1 and Q2. And again if you think about it, it is most notable in Q1 and then a little bit more in Q2 and then basically Q3 and Q4 look like it's looked the last several years. And so as we think about what the results look like for this quarter as well as our guidance for Q2, there's an impact related to the return to historical norms Q3\/Q4 no impact really.","Joseph Foresi","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes for the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please proceed.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning gentlemen. The first question is around the M&A pipeline, just in terms of can you update us, what are you seeing there? I mean, clearly you've been lot more aggressive with the buybacks which is great. But is that a sign that there really aren't a lot of deals in the horizon? And can you just remind us what the acquisition contribution for the quarter was as well, please?","Eugene A. Hall","Hey Manav. So, the - we have, at any given time we track a 100 or more companies. We will continue to do that. Our acquisition pipeline looks very robust, and it is very consistent with what we have seen in the past and that's our number one choice for deployment of capital. And we feel like that the repurchase - if you look at our cash flow, plus our balance sheet that we feel like we can do all the acquisitions we need and still do the repurchases that you have seen and the repurchases that we\u2019ll do going forward. So you shouldn't take that, that we see a less acquisition pipeline because of our aggressive purchases earlier this year.","Craig Safian","And then on your - the second part of your question, Manav. So as we said acquisitions had a two point benefit on the Research line and it would be about a one point benefit on the total revenue line.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then just on the back to the productivity, I guess you pointed out that it was flat sequentially, so - but you are still obviously gunning for much better than flat productivity by the end of the year. Can you just help us understand the sensitivity around, if that improves obviously, better than flat, how margins should be impacted?","Craig Safian","Yeah, sure. As we talked about at Investor Day, flat productivity got us to roughly 14% close to 15% CV growth, modest improvements in overall average productivity, can accelerate our CV growth a little bit more than that. From a margin perspective, you really see the margin flow through in the subsequent year. And so we wouldn't expect margin benefit in 2015 from continued acceleration in sales productivity. You would expect to see it in 2016 and beyond.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then in 2016, let's say, you have the same initiatives, does that offset that sort of margin improvement with the new sales investment, like I guess will we see it if you continue this pace, is I guess what I was getting at?","Craig Safian","Yeah, no, it\u2019s a good question. The power of our model and the leverage involved in our model, says that if we can get research contract value growing 16%, 17% per year, that being the largest portion of our revenue and our highest margin business. The power of the economics of the flow through on that will allow margin to flow through and we'll be able to make investments as well to continue to drive the business.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. We seem to have lost Peter there, I do apologize. The next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. There does seem to be a technical problem. I do apologize. The next question comes from Jason Anderson from Stifel. Please proceed.","Jason Anderson","Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Eugene A. Hall","We can hear you fine, yes.","Jason Anderson","Okay, just - one thing - and just if I am looking at this correctly, did client enterprises decline sequentially, and if so, is there anything going on there? It wouldn't seem to jive with your retention number, but I am just curious if there's anything there?","Craig Safian","Yeah, so if you look back historically, you will see often there is a modest decline in Q1. Again, it\u2019s generally our lightest new business quarter and decline is not troubling [ph] at all and the thing I would focus in on is the 8% year-over-year enterprise growth.","Jason Anderson","Great, and then I guess when we think about your client retention and then you talked about it being at all-time highs, but you continue to improve it. Is there a, I guess a theoretical ceiling here? I mean obviously everyone would love 100%, but that's not realistic. But is there a ceiling you might be approaching from a client enterprise retention standpoint?","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. So we think we can get our retention several points higher than it is today. As we look as we analyze kind of why we have turnover, we have programs that are designed to address those. So we think we have plenty of headroom still left on retention and we are working that. We expect retention to continue to improve over time.","Jason Anderson","Great. Thanks for that.","Operator","The next question comes in from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","John Crowther","Yes. You've got John Crowther on for Peter. Just real quick question you guys outlined the overall impact of FX to EBITDA and margins on an overall basis, wondering if you could highlight maybe the impact that was on the research segment this last quarter?","Craig Safian","Yeah, on research it was a pretty modest impact. I think on a FX neutral basis, our research margins would have been precisely flat and we had a modest down tick for the quarter. So it was less magnified on the research line, more magnified on some other lines.","John Crowther","Okay, great. And then you also highlighted I think, on the guidance that the impact of the lower share count would be offset by higher interest and other expenses. Just wondering if you could kind of give us your updated thoughts on both of those in terms of where they might end up for the full year?","Craig Safian","Yeah, so on the - on that comment, we are actually obviously buying back shares, is an accretive activity for us. And so with the accelerated pace of repurchases through the first quarter and a half, even including the incremental interest expense, it does benefit our EPS line. Our view was our forecast still fell within the guidance range, which is why we haven't updated the guidance range. But the pace of share repurchase absolutely benefits EPS in this year and even more so going forward.","John Crowther","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Andre Benjamin","Hi. Can you hear me?","Eugene A. Hall","Yeah, Andre we can hear you. Yeah.","Andre Benjamin","All right. Great. So I think most of my questions have actually been answered, but I had one small one. On the M&A contribution of 2%, primarily from Software Advice, if I run the math on that, and if I did it right it's about $7 million. So not up that much versus when you bought the asset. I was wondering if you have any updated thoughts on what the run rate for that business could be, say two years out and if there are any new initiatives to accelerate growth in that channel?","Craig Safian","So Andre, Software Advice is performing just as we expected. We expected it would be a business, that's a high growing business. It's growing quite a bit faster than our traditional IT business. And we expect that to continue for a substantial period of time. So and again, we expect that growth rate to continue to be high which means the dollar value would grow over time.","Eugene A. Hall","And the other thing worth mentioning, Andre is just that on the year-over-year comparisons we owned Software Advice for three weeks in the first quarter of last year, and for the full quarter this year, and so that may be impacting your view on the year-over-year growth a little bit as well.","Andre Benjamin","I think that's it from me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Please proceed.","Henry Chien","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, it is Henry Chien. Just I had a question on your sales force growth for the year. I was wondering if you could provide any color on - if there is any change in any particular regions or industries where you are looking to add more sales count.","Eugene A. Hall","So, it is Gene. Again we add our - we're planning to grow in every region and every industry in every size client. The rates are little higher, little lower depending on what we think the capability of the individual management teams are to absorb higher, little bit lower growth rates. In all of them, we expect to grow and grow at very good rates, but some will grow a little bit faster than others. And again it's not driven by any particular industry or geography. It's driven by - when we look at the individual sales manager, what's their capacity to absorb extra growth. And just as an example you might have a manager that's got - if they have ten direct reports, ten AEs, ten sales people and five of them are new, we would say that's probably as much as they can handle. If you have someone who has got eight sales people and seven of them are experienced, we would add --we'd give them more capability. And it also depends on the experience of the sales manager how long they have actually been working as a manager in their role. And so it is not driven by geography or industry, it is driven by what's the tenure of the manager and what's the composition of the actual team that they have, so we do it kind of bottoms up.","Henry Chien","Okay, all right. And in light of the share repurchase, any update on how we should think about your target leverage levels?","Craig Safian","So as we've talked about in the past, you know, we recognize - we know what an optimal capital structure should look like. We recognize that leverage is a part of it. As we talked about at Investor Day we recognize that optimal leverage is in the 1.5 to 2 times range. And we are - we are on a path to get there. On a net-debt basis, we now sit at roughly one times and on a gross debt basis, obviously closer to 1.5 times. And so we are effectively deploying our capital. We are putting leverage on the balance sheet and we will continue to do that when we see thing that can drive shareholder value.","Henry Chien","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, guys. Good morning. At the Investor Day you laid out a helpful model about you how changes in sales productivity flat to up a bit, to up a lot, would impact your financials over the next five years. But you didn't really provide us what a reasonable expectation for the trend line would be in that five years? And I guess, just when I look at it in the 10 years, you've been doing this model, you\u2019ve never had consistent year-over-year-over-year improvement in sales productivity. So what is a good expectation? And since you haven't done it in the past, why would one believe that you would be able to do that going forward in the next few years consistently?","Eugene A. Hall","So the - it\u2019s Gene, Gary. Actually, you know our sales productivity, if you look kind of like to like has been improving steadily over time. There has been countervailing forces that we have talked about at various points. So for example, there's U.S. Government sequestration that went on which affected part of our public sector business. Obviously, there was the downturn in 2008. So there has been some things like that that have affected our business over time. If you look at kind of like-for-like, we have seen kind of a steady improvement in sales force productivity, since we got out of the recession.","And again, as we look to the future, as a company, we are getting better programs in place all the time in terms of the three areas I've talked about. Our recruiting sales people, we get people that are a better fit, are training them, having better training programs and then providing better tools. Those things, those three areas are all getting better every year. And as we look at the impact on them, yeah we believe those will continue to improve sales force productivity.","Craig Safian","The other thing I would mention Gary and again in the Investor Day material it is there, is because of the size of the sales force, even modest improvements in productivity have a pretty significant impact. So a 5K improvement in productivity spread across 2,000 sales people is meaningful. Two years in a row of 5K improvement even more meaningful. And so based on what Gene described in terms of looking below the covers of what's really going on, plus what we have done over the past 12 months or last five quarters in actuality, we have great confidence that sales productivity can improve into the future.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, great. Thanks. And then the follow-up, I want to go back to buybacks. I appreciate the comment on leverage but you have clearly for two years now been debt financing the buybacks and particularly with the valuation of stock having gone up so much, it is less accretive than it was. And with the new buyback, and saying 2.5 years to three years, it seems like this pattern of having to debt finance it, because you are using more than your U.S. based free cash flow for buybacks will continue? Also, I think you've only hedged less than a third of the debt on interest rates. It just feels to me like it ends badly, rates go up or something happens and the pace of this, can't continue without taking more risks and potentially impacting the valuation.","So how do you think about that, are you indeed comfortable continuing to debt finance the buybacks over the next few years and how do you think about rates rising and what that could mean? Thank you.","Craig Safian","Yeah, I mean two things, I'd say Gary. One is, the pace of share buyback is roughly in line with our corporate free cash flow on an annual basis and has been for the last several years, has actually been below our free cash flow and just in the last year or so\u2026","Gary Bisbee","But only 6% of that\u2019s in the U.S., right, only 6% of free cash flow is in the U.S.?","Craig Safian","That is the correct. So there are lots of different things we can look at here. As you know with our new credit facility that we put in place had very attractive terms and gives us room to grow into as well. We are also locking in certain portions of that debt from an interest rate perspective, so that there isn't potential slippage on the interest expense on the upside. And look, and we will continue to monitor both our capital structure, whether or not buybacks, or how much buybacks are accretive to our shareholders et cetera. And we will not get out other over our [indiscernible] tips on this one for sure. We are watching it very closely, but it is our belief that again optimal capital structure in 1.5 times leverage range and that our two primary uses of our cash flow, both domestically and globally are strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.","Eugene A. Hall","And Gary, we have also - we have great confidence that our business is going to grow at attractive double digit rates ongoing in future. So if you say you're going to keep growing at double digit rates for an extended period of time, and this has been true the past, any of the repurchases as we've done [ph] are going be great. And that's the kind of business we have.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. So one question for you on the sales force hiring side, just whether you're seeing improving labor markets as helping or neutral and then if you would have any comments in terms of any geographies that stand out in terms of where the hiring is getting a little bit easier or a little tougher?","Eugene A. Hall","So It's Gene. So the labor markets are clearly improving around the world, we see that. However, Gartner is an incredibly attractive place to work for anybody who wants to be in a technology world. We are a premier employer, very attractive and so even as the markets around the world have improved, it doesn't affect our ability to hire, we - because of our attraction as a company et cetera, that hasn't really affected us at all. As you\u2019ll hear that sort of by geography the same thing is true around the world, that the - our ability to recruit is about the same as it has been anytime over the last three years or four years.","Bill Warmington","So you're perpetually oversubscribed basically?","Eugene A. Hall","Well, we - obviously we work hard to find the right people but the - again the improving level is not the issue because we are such an attractive place to be.","Bill Warmington","Got it. And then one question just on acceleration and the contract value on a constant currency basis, now that you've hit the 15% level, is - would it be fair for us to think about that level as being a sustainable level? Is it fair to expect that to continue to be at that level consistently, or should we expect some ups and downs around that? And then if you are going to be able to hit it sustainably what gives you comfort on that?","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. So, we believe we can grow our sales force 15% to 20% a year. So even at the low end of that range, we grow sales force at 15% a year over time, that means our CV - our contract value is going to grow 15% a year. Again, we think we can do better than that in the sales force, we think we will. And then secondly, we also think that we can simultaneously improve sales productivity modestly each year. As Craig pointed on Investor Day, if you grow - even if you had flat growth in the sales force being only 15% a year, and just improved productivity that accelerates our CV growth. We think we can do both. So we are quite optimistic about that over time our contract value growth could accelerate.","Bill Warmington","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions waiting. So I would now like to turn the call over to Gene for closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall","Well, thank you all for joining us today. To summarize the key points of today's call, first, we are doing great as a company. We are where we expected to be at this point of the year and all of our underlying metrics are strong. Our contract value growth rate accelerated and rolling fourth quarter sales productivity is up 12% for Q1 compared to Q1 2014. We remain committed to enhancing shareholder value through investment in our business, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. And we're getting better, stronger, faster all the time. I expect to see robust growth for years to come. We look forward to updating you again on our next quarterly earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

Please proceed, sir.","Brian Shipman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Call. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond.","This call will include a discussion of Q4 and full year 2012 financial results, as well as our initial guidance for 2013 as disclosed in today's press release.","After our prepared remarks, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions. I'd like to remind everyone that the press release is available on our website, and that URL is www.gartner.com.","Before we begin, we need to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

If you would like to attend, please e-mail my assistant, Germaine Scott. Her email address is germaine.scott@gartner.com.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Gartner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Gene?","Eugene A. Hall","Good morning, everyone. During 2012, the continued effective execution of our proven strategy resulted in another year of double-digit growth in our key financial metrics. And our key business metrics remained at or near record levels, establishing a strong foundation for another great year in 2013.","During 2012, as we've consistently done in the past, we delivered double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, earnings and cash flow. Chris will talk to the details of our financial results in a few minutes but let me touch on a few highlights.","For the full year in Research, our largest and most profitable segment, we added 878 net new client organizations, which is more than any quarter in our history, and we delivered 14% growth in contract value. For the fourth quarter in Research, we had double-digit growth in contract value across all major geographies. We ended the quarter with 83% client retention, which remains at our all-time high.","We had solid backlog growth in our Consulting segment and consistently strong demand throughout the year for our core consulting and benchmarking services. Our Q4 Consulting results were impacted by weaker than expected performance of our Contract Optimization business, and Chris will provide more details about that in a moment.","Events had another year of strong growth, with fourth quarter revenues up 21% over the same period last year. During the fourth quarter, more than 6,000 CIOs attended our symposium events. There's no other gathering in the world like our symposium series. I had the opportunity to meet with many of our clients at these events around the world, and these leaders are driving the performance of their organizations and they consistently see Gartner as central to their success.","These results continue to illustrate the continued success of our strategy and the tremendous value we bring to our clients. Investors sometimes ask how the macroeconomic environment affects our performance. Clients value our services whether they're growing or facing budget cuts. During 2012, the economic environment turned out to be worse than expected by most forecasters, and growth in the global economy slowed.","In this environment, we delivered double-digit growth across all geographies, all client sizes and virtually every industry segments.","In Europe, the economy contracted during 2012. We grew at double-digit rates across the region. We saw double-digit growth in nearly every country in Europe, including some of the most economically challenged countries in the world, Spain, Ireland, and Italy among them.","In China, where the economic growth was the slowest in more than a decade, we grew our Research business at double-digit rates.","In the U.S., economic growth was stagnant, and we grew our contract value at double digits.","In this environment, we delivered our 10th quarter in a row of double-digit contract value growth. And of course, every company has areas that can improve, and sales productivity is our opportunity for improvement and it's one of our highest priorities.","During 2012, we achieved flat sales productivity in a year with worsening economy conditions. And while this is a good result in a decelerating macro environment, we know we can do better. We're very focused on executing initiatives to grow the productivity of our sales force, and we fully expect that these initiatives will result in improving sales productivity.","These are remarkable times for information technology. We're on the cusp of a massive transition period, the impact of which will be on par with that of the industrial revolution. IT is transforming the world, from governments and cities, to banking, health care, agriculture, manufacturing and more. IT is changing how we work and what we do, and driving this change are 4 major technology forces: social, mobile, cloud and information. Every industry is being affected by these technology forces, and they're driving change on a scale seldom seen.","These transformations aren't just happened during 2012 or 2013. This technology revolution will remain vibrant for decades to come, and Gartner is at the heart of it. Gartner is the best source of help for enterprise leaders launching critical initiatives within the technology revolution. Our assistance often makes the difference between success and failure for our clients. And because of the huge and growing impact to the core technology forces I just mentioned, we are relevant whether an institution is growing or facing economic challenges.","We benefit from having a vast untapped market opportunity for our services. Every company and government agency in the world is a potential client. There are hundreds of thousands of IT and supply-chain professionals who could be potentially Gartner clients but have never been educated on the value we can provide.","Our sustained and consistent performance is due to the successful execution of the right strategy. And as some of you know, the fundamentals of our strategy are to create extraordinary research insight, to build strong sales capability, to deliver high-value differentiated offerings, to provide world-class service and to continually improve our operational effectiveness. This consistent strategy will allow us to maintain sustained double-digit growth over time.","During January, I met with our sales leaders from around the world. Our sales leaders, who work with clients from all geographies, all industries in all sizes are incredibly enthusiastic. They, too, are excited about Gartner and the value we provide.","I remain confident in and excited about Gartner. The Gartner brand is in a class by itself. Our products, services and people are superior to the competition, with a great business model, and we're relevant to institutions who are growing or facing budget cuts. We delivered double-digit growth in 2012, and we're well positioned for success in 2013 and beyond.","In summary, I'd like to leave you with 3 takeaways from today's call. First, our business performance was strong during Q4 and throughout 2012, providing a great foundation for 2013. We continue to deliver double-digit contract value growth. In Consulting, our core and benchmarking businesses deliver solid results. In Events, we continue to set record attendance and record numbers of CIOs, driven by the consistently relevant and excellent quality of our content. With a laser-like focus on our proven strategy, we will continue positive momentum for the coming year and beyond.","Second, clients value our services whether they're growing or facing difficult budget cuts.","And third, we are well positioned to achieve sustained double-digit growth of our key metrics as we have done over the past several years.","Like our clients and salespeople, I, too, am extremely excited about Gartner. We have a vast untapped market opportunity for our services. We have the right strategy. We have the right economic model and the right operating approaches. With these, I believe we'll continue to deliver sustained, profitable growth over the long term.","And with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Lafond","Thanks, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We ended 2012 with double-digit growth in revenue, earnings and free cash flow. Our results continue to demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy and our ability to consistently deliver on the financial objectives we've communicated over the past several years.","In the fourth quarter, we continued to see the strong trends in our key business metrics that we delivered during the first 3 quarters of the year. Year-over-year contract value growth remained strong, and retention rates ended at or near all-time highs.","Our benchmark and core Consulting businesses grew 6% on an FX neutral basis for the full year, and our Events business increased by more than 20% year-over-year for the third consecutive year. Demand for our services was robust across all of our primary business segments in the fourth quarter.","Our strong top line performance and effective execution in capitalizing on the operating leverage in our business allowed us to once again expand both our gross contribution and EBITDA margins. As a result, we delivered significant growth in earnings both in Q4 and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, normalized EBITDA increased 14% year-over-year, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was up 33%.","For the full year, we delivered normalized EBITDA of $315 million, up 13% from 2011. This growth in normalized EBITDA was notable, given that in our Consulting segment, the Contract Optimization business underperformed our expectations in 2012 and resulted in a negative impact to EBITDA of $8 million. I will talk more about this in a moment.","GAAP diluted earnings per share was up 24% from last year to $1.73. With a strong finish to 2012, we're well positioned for continued growth in 2013.","Now, I'll provide a review of our 3 business segments for the fourth quarter and full year, and then I'll conclude with a discussion of our outlook for 2013.","Starting with Research. Fourth quarter Research revenue was up 14% to $300 million. And on an FX neutral basis, Research revenue grew 15% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year in 2012. The contribution margin in this segment increased 65 basis points to 67.6% in the fourth quarter as our strong execution continues to capitalize on the operating leverage in this business.","For the full year, the contribution margin in our Research business grew by 70 basis points to 68.1%. All of our key Research business metrics remained very strong in the fourth quarter.","Contract value grew a record level $1.263 billion, a growth rate of 14% year-over-year on FX neutral basis. As was the case throughout 2012, our growth in contract value in Q4 was extremely broad-based across all geographies, client sizes and industry segments.","New business again increased year-over-year, continuing the trends we've seen since late 2009. The new business mix was balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. While our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting, approximately 80% of our contract value growth came from volume, with the balance coming from price increases.","This volume growth reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients. As a result, we ended the quarter with 13,305 client organizations, up 7% year-over-year. As for pricing, we've consistently increased our prices by 3% to 6% by year on an annual basis since 2005. We implemented a price increase during the fourth quarter of 2012, and we expect to do so again in 2013.","We should note that the average contract value per client organization has risen to another all-time high of $95,000 per organization, up from $90,000 last year. We continue to penetrate existing clients by leveraging our strong relationships.","Our client retention rate ended the quarter at 83%, and we retained client retention near record highs for 10 quarters in a row. In addition to retaining our research clients at an impressive rate, the clients we retained continue to increase their spending with us.","Wallet retention ended the year at 99%. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our larger clients. And as we've discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a 4 quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","In summary, our Research segment continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter. We grew our contract value by $155 million on an FX neutral basis year-over-year. We continued to see high levels of demand from clients, and we expect acceleration in contract value and revenue growth over time. We remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit annual revenue growth in this business over the long term.","Moving on to Consulting. Revenue in our Consulting business declined 8% on a reported basis in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange, Consulting revenue declined 7%.","For the full year, Consulting revenue declined 1% to $305 million but grew 1%, excluding foreign exchange. While the segment results were below our expectations, our benchmark and core Consulting businesses grew 6%, excluding foreign exchange in 2012. This is towards the high end of our long-term financial objectives for this segment.","Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $103 million, which represents 2% growth year-over-year and a healthy 4 months of backlog. Additionally, our pipeline looks equally solid as we begin 2013.","Billable headcount of 503 was up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2011. This reflects our focus on matching resources to the demand we saw in our labor-based Consulting business during 2012.","Fourth quarter utilization was over 67%, up 330 basis points from the prior quarter, and revenue per billable headcount ended the quarter at $445,000.","Excluding the Contract Optimization business, the overall Consulting segment had a very strong 2012. So let me spend a moment on Contract Optimization. As we told you in the past, this part of our Consulting segment can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And to put this business in perspective for you, Contract Optimization represents only 10% of our Consulting segment and continues to decline as a percentage of Consulting and total company revenue each year.","We expect Contract Optimization revenue to range from approximately $30 million to $40 million annually. It ended 2012 at the low end of that range after ending slightly above $40 million in 2011. While this impacted our overall Consulting results in 2012, we expect the overall Consulting segment to grow in the range of our long-term financial objectives in 2013.","Turning now to Events. Events in the fourth quarter increased 21% year-over-year on a reported basis and 24%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. During the fourth quarter, we held 14 events with 22,540 attendees compared to 12 events with 20,500 attendees in the fourth quarter of 2011. Total attendees of our events during Q4 on a same events basis were up 5% year-over-year and exhibitors were up 21%.","For the full year, revenue for our Events business increased 20% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. At the 62 events held in 2012 versus the 60 held in 2011, attendees were up 8%, exhibitors were up 20% year-over-year. On a same Events basis, attendees were up 7% and exhibitors were up 18%. For the full year 2012, the events gross contribution margin was 46%, up 148 basis points from 2011.","Moving down the income statement. During the fourth quarter, our total gross contribution margin was 59% compared to 58% in the prior year. And for the full year, our total gross contribution margin increased 86 basis points to 60%. These increases were primarily due to the successful execution of our strategy to capitalize on the high incremental margins and operating leverage inherent in our Research business.","SG&A increased by $15 million year-over-year during the fourth quarter. We continue to tightly control G&A costs across the entire company, and we continue to believe that this expense item will provide us with the source of operating leverage in the future as G&A will continue to decline as a percent of revenue. The SG&A increase is driven by the growth of our sales force. And as of December 31, we have 1,417 quota-bearing sales associates as compared to 1,268 a year ago.","For the full year, we added 149 salespeople, constituting 12% growth and slightly below our long-term target of growing our sales force by 15% to 20% per year. As we told you in the past, we will always be thoughtful about the expansion of our sales organization.","When the sales productivity remained flat in the back half of 2012, we slowed the pace of hiring in order to improve productivity. As Gene mentioned, we're focused on increasing sales productivity and, as we've been consistently told you, intend to grow our sales force by 15% to 20% annually. Sales force growth in 2012 should not be construed as a change in our growth expectations. We remain confident both in our market opportunity and growth expectations.","Moving on to earnings. We delivered another strong quarter of solid earnings growth. Normalized EBITDA was $97 million in the fourth quarter, up 14% year-over-year. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61, up 33% year-over-year. Our normalized EBITDA margin increased 60 basis points to 20.4%. And as expected, our Q4 2012 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes $0.02 in amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions, including Ideas International. This trend continues to reflect our commitment to improving margins while also investing in the growth of our business.","For the full year, normalized EBITDA was $315 million, up 13% year-over-year. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.73, up 24% year-over-year. Our normalized EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points to 19.5%. And as I mentioned previously, our earnings were adversely impacted by a shortfall in our Contract Optimization business.","EPS was positively impacted by a lower than expected tax rate in the fourth quarter and for the full year, largely due to the release of tax reserves related to the close of tax audits. And also diluted EPS for the full year 2012 included acquisition-related charges of $0.05 per share compared to $0.04 per share in 2011.","Turning to cash. Our strong performance for the full year translated into continued growth in free cash flow, which increased by 11% to $237 million. Over the long term, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow substantially greater than our net income, given our tight cash management and the negative working capital characteristics of our Research business.","During the fourth quarter, we utilized our cash to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we repurchased almost 480,000 shares at a total cost of approximately $22 million. For the full year, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a total cost of $111 million. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position with net cash of $95 million.","Our current credit facility runs through December of 2015 and, at this time, provides us with almost $350 million of remaining borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value.","We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. And in absence of appropriate acquisition opportunities, we believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital and we have $210 million remaining under our board authorization.","Let me now turn to our business outlook for 2013. Based on the strong business trends we experienced in 2012, we believe our businesses are well positioned for another year of strong growth. Our guidance for 2013 is based on the following assumptions: the current macroeconomic environment continues throughout the year, revenues of the Contract Optimization business and our Consulting segment remain at 2012 levels, sales productivity remains at 2012 levels, our sales force grows approximately 15%.","And with regard to foreign exchange, our guidance is based on the spot rates in early January. We've made no attempt in our guidance to anticipate any strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar from the actual foreign-exchange rates in early January. In light of the current macro-environment, we believe this are prudent assumptions.","And so for the full year 2013, we expect total revenues will grow by 10% to 13%, to approximately $1.78 billion to $1.82 billion on a reported basis. Projected revenues by segment can be found in our press release. But I would note that we expect growth at each of our 3 segments during 2013, with Research revenue expected to be up 13% to 14%, Consulting revenue up 2% to 7% and Events revenue up 6% to 12%.","Moving down to income statement. We expect normalized EBITDA for the full year 2013 to be between $350 million and $370 million, an increase of 11% to 17% over 2012. In 2013, we expect the cost associated with stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $37 million to $38 million.","Total depreciation and amortization should be approximately $33 million to $34 million, inclusive of the amortization of acquisition intangible assets. We expect interest expense of approximately $10 million, other expense of approximately $2 million.","We're projecting an annual effective tax rate of approximately 31%, and our guidance is based on an average fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 95 million shares for the year. Note that our tax rate may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of certain items.","Our GAAP earnings guidance for 2013 is for EPS to be between $1.96 and $2.10 per share. The intangible amortization associated with the acquisitions of AMR, Burton and Ideas will equate to approximately $0.04 per share for 2013. And as a result, we expect our EPS, excluding amortization from acquisitions, to be between $2 and $2.14 per share.","We also expect to grow free cash flow as we drive growth in our Research business. In 2013, we expect cash from operations of $296 million to $316 million, capital expenditures of $37 million to $38 million and free cash flow of $259 million to $278 million. Thus, we expect to grow our free cash flow by 10% to 17% in 2013 and generate free cash flow per share of $2.73 to $2.94, substantially above our income per share.","I'd like to note that cash from operations includes $3 million to be received as a tenant improvement allowance in connection with the previously disclosed lease arrangement on our Stamford headquarters. And the $3 million in the related costs of these improvements are reflected on our capital expenditures despite being reimbursed by the landlord. These amounts are not expected to have any impact on free cash flow during the life of the renovation project, which should end in early 2013 and is not expected to recur.","While our policy is to provide annual but not quarterly guidance, I'd like to provide some additional information to allow for an understanding of the seasonality and other factors that will impact our revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis. In 2013, total revenue, segment revenue and EPS phasing by quarter will approximate our reported results from 2012. I would also point out that the first quarter will again be the seasonally lightest quarter, with EPS coming in at less than 20% of the full year EPS.","I would also like to remind you that our Events segment is highly seasonal and more than 50% of the full year revenue to be recognized in Q4 because our Fall Symposium series is held at that quarter. At this point, we plan to host between 64 and 67 events in 2013 as compared to 62 in 2012.","Finally, I'd like to spend a moment on the impact of foreign exchange as it relates to our reported contract value. As we've communicated to you in the past, research contract value is reported on an FX neutral basis throughout each year. We do this so you can understand the true organic growth in our Research segment. In January of each year, we restate the opening contract value at current foreign-exchange rates.","As a result of changes in FX rates since January of 2012, contract value on January 1, 2013, is approximately $7 million higher than the $1,263,000,000 reported on December 31. And as a result, $1,270,000,000 is the baseline figure you should use for comparison purposes when analyzing FX neutral contract value growth in 2013.","So to summarize, we delivered great results both for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. Demand for our services is strong. And as a result, we generated double-digit revenue growth, and our key business metrics remained strong throughout 2012.","Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with the operating -- positive operating leverage inherent in our businesses, delivered strong margin expansion, and we generated substantial cash flow. As always, we're actively exploring strategic alternatives for deploying our cash. We'll continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we expect to repurchase shares throughout 2013.","Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in 2012, we established a solid foundation for delivering another strong year of revenue and earnings growth in 2013. We're well positioned for double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing returns to our shareholders over the long-term.","We'll now be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Gene, can you just comment on the IT spending environment in terms of your offerings today compared to where we were last year at this time?","Eugene A. Hall","Eric, so there's 2 separate issues. I'm not sure if I understand the question. So the overall IT spending environment, we're expecting IT spending in FX neutral terms around the world to grow about 3.9% during 2013. And so that's one, if you're asking about the -- how much people are spending on IT goods and services, that would be it. That doesn't cover our spending and what they're spending on Gartner-type services. Does that answer your question?","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, I was just wondering about the demand for your type of your product compared to where you were last year as far as budgets and just how difficult of a selling agreement is today compared to last year.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, it's -- the selling environment is the same. Basically, our selling is limited by the amount of sales capacity we have. There's essentially unlimited demand. It's a matter of how fast we can get to clients and educate them on the value of our services. And so in essence, the selling environment that we see is exactly as it was last year. Last year, at this time, we had -- and throughout the year had kind of infinite demand, and we have the same situation today.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So with the sales force growth assumption of 15%, I mean, is that just really due to the productivity being a little bit lower than where you had hoped to be just because of the microenvironment? Is that how we should think about it?","Eugene A. Hall","So we basically would -- I have said in the past, would continue this, which is as we -- we like to grow our sales force 15% to 20% a year. We're going to grow at the lower end when we see sales productivity not advancing as fast as we'd like and the higher end when we see the productivity there. And so you can interpret that we'll be kind of at the 15% end because we think there's an opportunity to continue to improve sales productivity and we want to focus on that at this point. Again, during the year, if that changes and we see productivity tick up, we'd accelerate our hiring during the year.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just finally, I noticed you talked about double-digit growth across geographies. Is that the same for your vertical breakout as well?","Eugene A. Hall","So we had double-digit growth, as you mentioned, across all the geographies around the world. We had double-digit growth across virtually every industry segment, and the couple of segments that weren't were just below. So they rounded down as opposed to rounded up, perhaps, to double digit. So it's not like one fell off and went -- was mid-single digit or something like that. It's just slightly below double digit, a couple of segments..","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Any detail on which ones, those were government, I assume, maybe?","Eugene A. Hall","I take it as noise basically because, as I said, last quarter they were above. This quarter, they were below.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Gene, can you talk a little bit about, please, what you're doing to drive sales force productivity?","Eugene A. Hall","Sure, Peter. It's my favorite subject. We are -- basically, there's 3 areas we're working on. The first is recruiting, making sure we recruit people that are really well-suited to be successful at Gartner. And because we have associates around the world, obviously, it's not as simple as just recruiting for the right kind of person in just the U.S. or just New York City. And so the first piece is recruiting. The second piece is training, and training both for our new hires, as well as for our experienced people. With our rapid sales force growth, we've got to be prepared to give managers great training to equip them, as we have many new managers with our growth, with the promotions people get. And obviously, there's so many new people coming onboard. We've also have a lot of innovation in our offerings and what's going on in the technology world, and so we need to keep our salespeople up on that. That's another important part of the training. And then lastly, it's productivity enhancing tools. And so we, basically, continually have a set of -- continually enhance the set of tools that we give our salespeople to help them be more productive, things like what are the most important topics that our clients are going to care about, and automating certain parts of the selling process so that it doesn't take a salesperson's time. And in fact, it's an automated part of the process. So those are really the 3 areas that we're focused on.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. So you added 21% to the sales force last year. Should I take it that basically maybe the onboarding was just -- I don't want to say a little rougher, but just not quite as -- didn't come in as hoped in 2012? And was that the key reason for reduced productivity this year, it's a reflection of the higher level of hiring last year?","Eugene A. Hall","No. I think, basically, what's going on with the productivity is that clients get a lot of value in our services whether they're growing, whether they're shrinking. When they are shrinking, the selling cycle is a little harder than it is than if they're growing. So I think the primary thing that affected our sales productivity is if you look again like in Europe, as I mentioned on my comments, on my prepared comments, the economy actually shrank in Europe, and we grew at double digit there. Now if it hadn't been such terrible -- so many companies in so much trouble, then I think our sales productivity would have ticked up quite a bit. But again, if you look at the global macroeconomic environment, there were many -- a higher portion of the companies or institutions that were facing big budget cuts, those selling environments are a little bit tougher. And again, we're very successful there. But it's a little bit tougher and it, I think, had a bit of an impact. That's why our sales productivity didn't grow as we would have liked it to.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then just not to obsess too much on this, but the guidance on research revenue growth of 13% to 14% in fiscal '13, to the extent that you end the year with 14% CV growth, it would seem simplistically to imply that you're not necessarily anticipating, at least in the guidance, improved productivity in '13. Is that fair?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, Peter. It's Chris. I just commented, I think, during my remarks that the assumption in our guidance is that sales productivity remains at 2012 levels. As Gene said, we also do not anticipate the economic environment changing. So with those 2 factors, we thought it was prudent to assume in our guidance that it would stay roughly where we are today in both of those -- with both of those.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Then last thing, Chris. So on margin leverage, just some color in terms of how we should think about the ability to continue to drive margin improvement.","Christopher J. Lafond","So I think you need to look at it in the multiple pieces, Peter. So if you start with the 3 businesses, as we talk about all the time, we have great incremental margins in all 3 businesses. 70% in Research, as you know, we're at 68%, so we still have a little bit of room there for expansion. But we've moved that from 58% to where we are today. So we've made some big movements over the last few years, and now we're hitting and approaching our 70% number, still a little bit of room there for improvement. The Events business, incrementally around 50%, and we still have a little bit of room there. And Consulting ultimately at 40%, and we still have a little bit of room there. So you still see a little bit of room on the top line, and also you get the continued mix shift. So Research has been shifting and went from below 60% to now over 70% of revenues. So we've moved that significantly, and that shift will still give us a little bit certainly starting to approach a number were, while it could still grow, not as fast as we saw in the past. That's kind of what's happening on the gross margin side. When you go below the line, we still believe we'll get G&A, infrastructure, expansion opportunities. So I think if you're looking at our expectations for 2013, we're still expecting G&A to be a lower percentage of revenue. And then the big driver moving forward is sales productivity. So over time, we expect that as sales productivity improves, we start to see the S as a percent of revenue start to flatten and come down. As you know, that's been inching up as we've expanded our sales force. So those are the main drivers of margin expansion in EBITDA. We still feel extraordinarily comfortable that we'll continue to deliver margin expansion over time.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I think you've said in the past, Chris, I may have this range wrong, 50 to 150 basis points a year. Is that still operative?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, we still believe 50 to 150 basis points is absolutely realistic. And you're going to get more towards the high end as you get real sales productivity expansion, and you'll be more at the low end as sales productivity stays flatter. And that's what you're seeing kind of in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","You talked about sales productivity. Obviously, it was flat for the year. But can you give us any color in terms of vintage of when the salespeople came in or by region or by vertical in terms of areas that were stronger or weaker? And I'm assuming it wasn't all exactly flat.","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, it was pretty much consistent across the board, so no big differences in terms of one area. I think, any of the differences were pretty minor and I'd put in the category of noise as opposed to something significant.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And the Contract Optimization business, I understand you gave -- it's usually in a fairly narrow range but it was the low end of that range this year. Is there any reason? I mean, can you point to where there -- was there turnover? Was projects just pushed out? What drove, I guess, you to the low end of the normal range?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, so -- it's Gene. So that business is a business -- and we've talked about in the past, it's a fairly lumpy business, meaning there's a few deals that decide whether -- how that business a few meaning on the order of they might do 100 deals a year, something like that. And so the -- if you have a few more deals or few less deals, that's what swings that business. And it -- the way it works is it's on a contingency fee basis so -- most of the business. So what happens is that a client negotiates a deal, we come in and we can help them, and they buy, get it cheaper, then we make -- we get paid in that business. If we help them and they don't buy, we don't get paid. And so that's what the nature of the business is. So we can do a lot of work with the clients. And if they actually decide not to purchase from the vendor that we work on, because it's contingency fee basis, we don't get paid. So by its intrinsic nature, it's not kind of a recurring revenue or a smooth business, it's very lumpy. And it was at the -- we had a couple of years -- in last 3 or 4 years, it's been the higher end of lumpy. And the last year, unfortunately, was the lower end of lumpy.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And did you say earlier, Chris, an $8 million swing to EBITDA from that?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes. So what I mentioned was, if you look back in 2011, we did about 40 -- a little over $40 million of revenue for Contract Optimization. This year, we did just about $30 million, and it is extraordinarily profitable. And I think 80% of that flows through, so you're talking about an $8 million year-over-year change to EBITDA. And that, by itself, is one of the biggest drivers of the year-over-year EBITDA delta that people were looking at versus consensus, I believe.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So a bounce back in that business, you should see the contribution margin from Consulting improve next year?","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, so if it bounces back -- so as I also talked about in my remarks, we're not expecting it to grow. We expect it to be exactly where it is this year. Should that be different, you'll see incremental revenue and an 80% flow-through of that incremental revenue. So it will bounce right back through to profitability should it recover.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question relates to Europe. I know you spoke to a pretty broad-based strength there. But can you talk about whether or not you're seeing any signs of stabilization or sort of macro-related improving sentiment in any countries? Any reason for incremental optimism there?","Eugene A. Hall","So, as I mentioned, we had great performance in Europe, double-digit growth in -- overall in most of the countries, including some of the most challenged countries. We're not seeing -- in terms of our business, we're not seeing any change this year compared to last year, so we're expecting great growth again in Europe this year. And I really can't -- couldn't comment on -- so our clients are vying for position just like they did last year. I don't really see any change in the overall macroeconomic environment just from our perspective on it.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And related to international, can you talk in terms of, let's say, 5 years out, I mean, which are the international markets, all over and not just Europe, in which you see the most opportunity for growth?","Eugene A. Hall","So we're in 85 countries today, and we expect to be -- we're not planning to add more countries. It would be on a very selective basis if we did. And in essence, all those countries have tremendous growth opportunities, and the -- we're pretty much growing at good double-digit rates in virtually all of them. I mean, again, there could be some exceptions around in 85, but they all have kind of -- our level of penetration is very little in all of them. I mean, even in the U.S., as we've talked about, we have a very low level of penetration of our opportunities, even in the U.S., where we've had the longest presence. And so we don't have -- when we look out to 5 years, we see -- we should have -- we certainly have the opportunity for great double-digit growth in every one of those 85 countries.","Kelly A. Flynn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then last question related to Consulting. I think you've been pretty clear and helpful on Contract Optimization, but I just want to make sure I understand. Is there anything else going on in Consulting that was disappointing this quarter? Or is it all related to the Optimization business?","Christopher J. Lafond","Kelly, it's Chris. Not with all related to that. So I think if you look at the core Consulting business, that business actually grew 6% for us in 2012, which is great. It's much faster than actually it's been growing in the past, up towards the higher end of our range. So when you look at Consulting, if you look at backlog, if you look at margin expansion and utilization, all of those things in that core business, which, again, is 90% of the Consulting business, had a really nice strong performance, and the whole delta is driven out of this one area. That just happens to be such a high incremental margin. So we feel great about the rest of that business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Karimzad with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first one for Chris. The free cash flow conversion from the adjusted EBITDA in the '13 guidance, it looks like it's round 74%, 75%. And if I look back historically, maybe I'm running the numbers wrong, you guys typically do 75% to 80% range. So can you walk us through why we're not closer to the midpoint of what you have historically done?","Christopher J. Lafond","Sure, Brian. There's probably a couple of things there. So if you look at 2 things, cash taxes and CapEx. CapEx has increased slightly. As you know, we're pretty low in terms of CapEx. We -- over the last couple of years, I think last year when you net out the reimbursements from our landlord, we spent, I think, $29 million in '11, $31 million in '12. And next year, it's inching up to $34 million. So you have a little bit more. We think that's absolutely the right investments to make in our business for all the things we're talking about, whether that's sales productivity or other things that will drive the business. So we still think that's a relatively low percentage for a company of our size, but that's inching up a bit. And as we've told you over time, cash taxes has inched up a bit. So those 2 things are the drivers. There's nothing other than that, that's fundamentally changed in terms of our cash flow dynamics.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the long-term revenue target. I mean, something that has been a bit frustrating in this info services space have been these long-term targets that companies set on revenue growth that, frankly, represent numbers that haven't been seen since 2007 and before. For example, on the research side, I think the last time you did 15% plus x currency growth was 2007. And I guess, for the guidance this year, you're making an assumption macro doesn't change. For us, let's say, we're taking a 3-year horizon and, let's say, that macro just kind of stays how it's been for another 3 years in your kind of industrialized markets, what's your sense on the cap of that research revenue growth? How much of it was kind of banking on having a 2007 type level of macro environment?","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. Basically, we -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we think there's lots of room to improve our sales productivity, and that's kind of at the heart of what's going on. So it's less about the macro environment. It's really about our improving sales productivity, and we think that there's plenty of room in sales productivity. We think we know what to do to do it, and we have programs to do it. So if you look at our 3-year time period, we're expecting sales productivity will continue to go up, and that will result in accelerating growth over time.","Christopher J. Lafond","I think it's important to note, when we set our long-term, 15% to 20% for Research and all of our long-term objectives, we did not assume that the world was always in spectacular 2007 economic environment. We expect in normal economic times, and as Gene said, we're doing lots of things to work on sales productivity. So I don't think you should read into our numbers that it has to be a perfect economic environment for us to achieve those kind of numbers. We don't believe that.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So most of the productivity then issue is kind of an internal process type thing? It's not tougher selling environment in Europe and facing cuts?","Eugene A. Hall","As I mentioned earlier, when clients have budget cuts, it's harder to sell than when clients are growing and have lots of money. We can be very successful in the environment we are. But it does -- I think what happened last year is that in a stable economic environment, our sales productivity would have increased. But because the global economy decelerated, kind of it offset our -- the improvements that we had in the pipeline there. And so again, we're going to make improvements. And hopefully, the global economy will at least remain stable and won't decelerate any further.","Operator","At this time, there are no additional audio questions. Speaker, you may proceed.","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. And I want to make sure that I invite you again to our Investor Day, which is next Thursday, 14th of February. No better way to spend Valentine's Day than at a Gartner investor conference.

In 2014, we drove double-digit growth in all our key financial metrics and our business is accelerating. For the full year 2014, on an FX neutral basis, contract value increased 14%, total company revenues grew 14% and EBITDA grew 13%. We achieved double-digit contract value growth in every region, every industry and every company size. The continued successful execution of our proven strategy was central to our success.

We ended the year with 92 managing partners, up 15% from the start of the year.","Our Events business also delivered a fantastic performance. On a same-event basis, for the 13 events we held in Q4, we drove a revenue increase of 19% year-over-year FX neutral.","Additionally, in 2014, we deployed capital in 3 strategic acquisitions. And finally, for the full year, we repurchased more than $400 million of our shares which exceeded our original plan.","We just had our worldwide sales kickoff where we spent time with more than 400 of our sales leaders. They're as enthusiastic about our prospects for growth as I've ever seen. They know technology is driving massive change in every industry around the world and that we can make a real difference in our client success.","One of the primary reasons our business is so successful is our people. At the heart of it, Gartner is a people business. Over the past several years and throughout 2014, we made significant investments in our people. We've also added great teams as a result of our acquisitions. We're attracting the best talent in the industry in strategic locations around the world and getting them up to speed quickly. And these investments continue to pay off, as illustrated by our sales productivity gains and overall 2014 results.","We're starting 2015 in a great position. The insights we create, the advice we deliver and the overall experience for our customers has never been better. We'll continue to improve and innovate across every area of our business. We know how to be successful in any economic environment. We're relevant whether an institution is growing or facing economic challenges. We continue to deliver double-digit results in our key operating metrics through the tremendous value we deliver to our clients. The Gartner brand is in a class by itself. Our products, services and people are superior to the competition with a great business model, and we continue to be more relevant to virtually every enterprise in the world. I remain confident and excited about Gartner. And with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Craig.","Craig Safian","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. 2014 was a very strong year. During the fourth quarter, Gartner continued its accelerated performance with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue and normalized EBITDA, putting the company in a great position as we enter 2015. Year-over-year FX neutral contract value growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter and finished the year up 14%. Retention rates also ended the year at all-time highs. Our Events business increased revenues by 19% year-over-year on a same-event and FX neutral basis in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year. And our Consulting business grew revenues by 7% on an FX neutral basis for the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year on the strength of both our labor-based Consulting business and our Contract Optimization practice.","We continue to see robust demand for our services across all of our business segments in the fourth quarter. Our business continues to grow at double-digit rates quarter after quarter, year after year, which is why we remain very excited about our prospects for future growth. Our products and services provide unparalleled value to IT, supply chain and digital marketing professionals. We are engaged on their most important projects and initiatives, and we make a difference to the success of their enterprises. Our strong and improving retention metrics further demonstrate the value and importance of our products and services. In both existing and prospect accounts, we continue to find new IT, supply chain and digital marketing professionals to sell to every day. We're confident that we will continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance over the long term.","I'll now provide a review of our 3 business segments for the fourth quarter and the full year, and then we'll end with the details of our outlook for 2015 before taking your questions. Since we are a global company, with operations and clients in 90-plus countries, the strengthening U.S. dollar had an impact on our fourth quarter results. I will address the impact in each area, but roughly speaking, our reported growth rates were impacted negatively by 3 to 4 points in the quarter by foreign exchange.","Starting with our Research business. Research revenue was up 12% on an as-reported basis and grew 15% on an FX neutral basis in the fourth quarter. Acquisitions added approximately 2 points to our organic growth rate in Q4. The contribution margin for Research was 69% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. All other key Research business metrics also remained strong. Contract value grew to a record level of $1.603 billion, a year-over-year growth rate of 14% on an FX neutral basis. This reflects continued acceleration from late 2013. As has been true over the past several years, our growth in contract value in Q4 was extremely broad-based with every region, every client size and every industry segment growing at double-digit rates. The acceleration in our contract value growth was driven by improvements in both retention and new business.","Our client retention rate at the enterprise level ended the quarter at 85%, up 2 points versus the same quarter last year, the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in this metric. Wallet retention at the enterprise level ended at 106% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 2 points over last year's fourth quarter. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in wallet retention. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and because we retain a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we have discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a rolling 4-quarter basis to eliminate any seasonality.","New business, again, increased year-over-year, up 15% over last year's fourth quarter and up 13% on a full year basis. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. Our contract value growth also continues to benefit from our discipline of not discounting and of consistent annual price increases. We have increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year since 2005, and our price increase from this past fourth quarter averaged 3%.","We also continue to see strong volume growth in our new business. This reflects our success in growing the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises. As a result, we ended the quarter with 9,958 client enterprises, up 10% over last year's fourth quarter. This represents almost 2,000 net new enterprises added since Q4 of 2011, further illustrating the size and scale of our untapped market opportunity. Also, the average spend per enterprise continues to increase reflecting our ability to grow our contract value by driving growth in both new and existing enterprises.","I also want to spend a moment addressing sales productivity. We provide all the input so that you can calculate sales productivity on your own. As we have detailed in the past, we look at sales productivity as the net contract value increase, or NCVI, per account executive. We look at it on a rolling 4-quarter basis to eliminate seasonality, and we use opening sales headcount as the period denominator. Let me do the math for you.","Over the last 12 months, we grew our contract value by $202 million in FX neutral terms. Dividing that by our Q4 2013 ending sales headcount of 1,643 yields NCVI per AE of $123,000 on a rolling 4-quarter basis, a 14% improvement over 2013 and up compared to any of the first 3 quarters of 2014.","To sum up, our Research business again delivered great results. Contract value growth accelerated in each quarter of 2014, as we expected. We see strong demand from clients, our retention rates remain at or near all-time highs and we expect continued acceleration and productivity, contract value and revenue growth over the long term.","Turning now to Events. For the quarter and full year, our Events segment continued a 5-year trend of extremely strong year-over-year revenue growth on a same-event basis. On a reported basis, in the fourth quarter, Events revenue increased 20% year-over-year and increased 23% on an FX neutral basis. For the full year 2014, Events revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and grew 16% on an FX neutral basis. During the fourth quarter, we held 13 events with 23,453 attendees compared to 11 events with 20,786 attendees in the fourth quarter of 2013.","On a same-event and FX neutral basis, Events revenue was up 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter underscoring the strength of our Events business. During the fourth quarter, we held most of our Symposium events. Gartner's Symposium is our flagship conference series specifically designed for CIOs. Revenue for the Symposium series grew by 20% in 2014, contributing to the overall Events performance in Q4. At our Symposium series, we hosted more than 6,000 CIOs, 9% more than we hosted in 2013. Q4 gross contribution margin for Events of 56% was up 3 points from the fourth quarter a year ago. The gross contribution margin for the full year 2014 in the Events segment was 49%, up from 46% in 2013.","Moving on to Consulting. Revenues in Consulting increased 3% on a reported basis and 7% on an FX neutral basis in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Consulting revenues grew 11% on a reported basis and 12% on an FX neutral basis. We again posted solid results across the entire business, with our labor-based business recording 7% revenue growth in the quarter. On the labor-based side, billable headcount of 535 was up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter utilization was 72%, a 7-point improvement over the fourth quarter of last year. And annualized revenue per billable head ended the quarter at $463,000, an 8% improvement over Q4 of last year.","As we have discussed in the past, our Contract Optimization practice has more variability than the other parts of our Consulting business. This fourth quarter was no exception, as this business contracted modestly versus the prior year quarter. Across the entire Consulting business, we continue to see strong demand for our services and our strategy of investing in managing partners is allowing us to capture that demand. We ended the year with 92 managing partners, an increase of 15% from a year ago. Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $103 million. This represents a healthy 4 months of forward backlog. With the current backlog and visibility we have into the pipeline, the Consulting business is positioned to deliver another year of solid results in 2015.","Moving down the income statement. SG&A increased by $23 million year-over-year during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force. For the full year 2014, SG&A increased $116 million, again driven by growth in our sales force. As of December 31, we had 1,881 quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 238 or 14%.","Moving on to earnings. Normalized EBITDA was $122 million in the fourth quarter, growth of 15% from last year's fourth quarter. Normalized EBITDA growth, excluding the impact of FX, was 18% in the quarter or an impact of roughly $3 million. For the full year, normalized EBITDA was $386 million, representing 12% growth for 2014 and 13% on an FX neutral basis. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.66 in the fourth quarter, compared with $0.65 per share in the same period last year. Our Q4 2014 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes $0.06 in amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions. Excluding acquisition-related charges, our normalized EPS grew 9% to $0.72 per share in the fourth quarter.","Our Q4 EPS figures were impacted by foreign exchange in 2 primary ways. First, the impact on EBITDA that I just mentioned; and second, the impact on our tax rate for the quarter. As we have discussed in the past, our tax rate is sensitive to the mix of geographic earnings. With a stronger U.S. dollar, the proportional mix of geographic earnings from outside of the U.S. was lower than anticipated, causing a higher tax rate than we projected.","For the full year 2014, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.03, up 5% year-over-year. Our full year 2014 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes $0.21 in amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions. Excluding acquisition-related charges, our normalized EPS grew 14% to $2.24 for the full year 2014. Excluding the impact of FX, normalized EPS grew approximately 15% over 2013.","Turning now to cash. Operating cash flow increased by 10% to $347 million for the full year 2014, compared with last year. During the fourth quarter, we continued to utilize our cash to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. In the quarter, we repurchased 0.5 million shares, and we used approximately $42 million of cash for share repurchases. For the full year, we repurchased $432 million worth of our shares.","As of December 31, we had $413 million remaining on our $800 million authorization. Even with the more aggressive pace of share repurchases and the acquisitions we did in 2014, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position. As of December 31, we had debt of $405 million and cash of $365 million with 83% of our cash balance located outside of the U.S.","In December, we put an expanded credit facility in place that took advantage of the favorable credit markets and accomplished 3 primary goals. First, the new facility is right-sized for the company. We doubled its size to $1.5 billion. This gives us ample flexibility and room for growth as well. Second, the pricing in covenant packages are more favorable than our prior facility. And finally, we pushed out the maturity of the loan until December of 2019. We have ample cash flow and with the new facility, ample liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive shareholder value. We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We also continue to believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital.","Now let me turn to our business outlook for 2015. Our most important underlying business metrics and trends are all strong, accelerating and trending in the right direction. CV growth, retention rate, sales productivity, Events performance or Consulting utilization, all those key metrics improved in 2014. Our business is very strong and our outlook fully anticipates those trends to continue. Our reported results will be impacted by the strengthened U.S. dollar. The dollar strengthening has been significant and has even accelerated in the month of January, with the dollar increasing against key currencies like the euro by 7% in January alone.","As we have detailed in the past, our revenues and expenses are roughly matched around the globe, creating a natural hedge. Roughly 60% of both our total revenues and total expenses are transacted in the U.S. dollar. The remaining 40% are in major currencies, such as the euro, the pound sterling and the Australian dollar, to name a few. The U.S. dollar has strengthened dramatically against all these currencies, and our 2015 outlook is derived using spot rates from last Friday, January 30. The underlying business metrics and FX neutral growth rates of the company are very strong. We will continue to run the company and invest for the future, as we've been doing successfully over the last several years.","With that, I'll review the 2015 outlook. Our businesses are well-positioned for another year of strong FX neutral growth in 2015. Our base level assumptions are as follows: Sales productivity remains flat or improves marginally from 2014 levels on an FX neutral basis. Our sales force grows approximately 15%. And as I just mentioned, we have used foreign exchange rates from January 30 in setting our guidance and outlook for the year. As always, we'll report back with updates on our quarterly earnings calls and with any changes to these assumptions. The details of our 2015 outlook are included in today's press release, and I'll summarize them here as well.","For the full year 2015, we expect total revenues of $2.150 billion to $2.205 billion. This is FX neutral growth of 12% to 15%. The projected revenues by segment on an as-reported basis can be found in our press release. On an FX neutral basis, our guidance anticipates Research revenue to be up 14% to 16% versus the prior year, reflecting the acceleration of our contract value growth achieved in 2014. Our Consulting outlook is for revenues to be flat to up 6% over 2014 on an FX neutral basis. This guidance assumes that the Contract Optimization practice within Consulting returns to its historical levels of revenue, which is negatively impacting the Consulting guidance. We expect the labor-based portion of Consulting to grow in the mid-single digits. And our Events revenue guidance is to be up 11% to 18% over 2014, on an FX neutral basis. At this point, we plan to hold approximately 65 events in 2015 as compared to 64 in 2014.","Moving down the income statement, we expect normalized EBITDA for the full year 2015 to be between $405 million and $430 million, an increase of 10% to 17% over 2014 on an FX neutral basis. We expect the costs associated with our stock-based compensation expense in 2015 to be approximately $43 million to $44 million. Total depreciation and amortization should also be between $43 million and $44 million, inclusive of the amortization of acquired intangible assets. We expect interest expense of between $15 million and $16 million and other expense of $2 million. We're projecting an annual effective tax rate of approximately 35% to 36%. The tax rate is driven by the FX impact on our projected mix of earnings. And our guidance is based on an average fully diluted shares outstanding for the full year of approximately 87.5 million shares. Note that our tax rate may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of certain items.","Our GAAP EPS earnings guidance for 2015 is for EPS to be between $2.11 and $2.30 per share. GAAP EPS includes $0.16 per share of acquisition-related charges for the full year 2015. Our guidance for EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges, is to be between $2.27 and $2.46 per share, FX neutral growth of approximately 7% to 16% over 2014.","In 2015, we expect cash from operations of $348 million to $374 million, gross capital expenditures of $45 million to $46 million and acquisition and integration charges of $12 million. This yields a free cash flow range of $315 million to $340 million. Thus, we expect to generate free cash flow per share of $3.60 to $3.89 in 2015. As in prior years, our free cash flow should again be well in excess of our net earnings levels in 2015. As with our earnings, the strengthening U.S. dollar impacts cash flow in a similar manner.","Now I'd like to provide some additional information to allow for an understanding of the seasonality and other factors that will impact our revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis. In 2015, our EPS phasing by quarter will reflect seasonality roughly similar to our reported results from 2014 with a few notable exceptions. The first quarter will again be the seasonally lightest quarter of the year. As a result, we expect GAAP EPS to be between $0.31 and $0.33 per share in the first quarter. We expect approximately $0.04 per share of acquisition and integration charges in Q1. EPS in the first quarter will be impacted primarily by lower projected Contract Optimization revenues and the impact of FX.","I would also like to remind you that our third quarter is also a seasonally light quarter, again due to our Events calendar and our Consulting business. As in years past, the fourth quarter is our largest with more than 50% of the full year Events revenue occurring in Q4.","Finally, I'd like to spend a moment on the impact of foreign exchange as it relates to our reported contract value. As we've communicated to you in the past, research contract value is reported on an FX neutral basis throughout each year. We do this so you can understand the true organic growth in our Research segment.","In early January of each year, we restate the opening contract value at current foreign exchange rates. As a result of changes in FX rates since January of 2014, contract value at January 1, 2015, is approximately $53 million lower than the $1.603 billion reported on December 31. As a result, $1.550 billion is the baseline figure you should use for comparison purposes when judging contract value growth in 2015 on an FX neutral basis.","So before taking your questions, let me summarize. We delivered another very strong quarter in Q4. Demand for our services is robust, and as a result, our research contract value growth accelerated again, and we generated double-digit total revenue growth. We are as strong as we've ever been as a company. Our key business metrics are improving significantly or are at or near all-time highs. Both client and wallet retention continue to improve setting new records each quarter.","Sales productivity improved by 14% in 2014. We grew the number of enterprises we serve by 10% to almost 10,000. And contract value growth accelerated in each quarter of 2014, ending the year at 14% growth. Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with a positive operating leverage inherent in our business, delivered solid earnings and cash flow growth for the full year 2014. And we continue to actively explore strategic alternatives for deploying our cash.","Going forward, we will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisition and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Finally, by closing out 2014 with double-digit growth in contract value, we begin the new year very well-positioned to deliver another year of strong revenue and earnings growth in 2015.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jeff Meuler from R.W. Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I didn't catch it if you articulated it explicitly, but for the guidance for '15, what are you assuming for research contract value constant currency? I caught that sales force growth of 15% and productivity, I think, flat to up marginally. So are you assuming further acceleration into the 15% to 16% range?","Craig Safian","We don't give contract value guidance. That has been our rule, and we don't do that. You can do the math, and the math would presume that we are in the 14% to 15% range, if you assume those productivity statements we made as well as the headcount growth.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then one thing that stood out in the guidance is the delta between the normalized EBITDA guidance and the diluted EPS or the adjusted EPS guidance at the low end. At the top end of the range, it's just 1% delta. At the low end, it's a 4% delta. Is that based on the assumption of geographic mix of revenue and tax rate? Or what's the delta there?","Craig Safian","The delta, Jeff, is primarily around tax rate. And that is driven by foreign exchange, which is obviously driving up that higher projected effective tax rate.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, I caught that Contract Optimization -- obviously, you've had a banner year this year and you're assuming a bit down for next year, but if I recall correctly, I think the range was something like 40 to 50 historically. Is that correct? And what was it this year?","Craig Safian","Yes, we had typically said $30 million to $40 million in revenue was the range. We well- exceeded that in 2015 -- 2014 rather, and our expectation for 2015 is to go back to, call it, roughly the top end of that, near the top end of that range.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Timothy McHugh from William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes. Can I just ask about the Research gross margin a little bit more and I guess also the consulting gross margin? But first the Research, just, I guess, it was kind of down slightly year-over-year for the second quarter in a row. Can you talk a little bit more about what's driving that? I appreciate you're getting close to the kind of 70% number you've talked about, but are we just at a point where you are sustainable and you're not going to see much improvement there? Or was there something else going on in the quarter?","Craig Safian","Good question. So on a full year basis, Research gross margins were up about 10 basis points. So I'd say, there are 2 things going on there. One is there is a modest impact from the acquisitions, modest, and then over the long-term, we still believe 70% is roughly the right target gross margin for us. So you're likely to see modest improvements over the years as we approach 70%.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, as we look forward to next year, so can you talk about -- it seems like the margin guidance is for basically flattish margins, and I guess, you were kind of flat to down a little bit last year and the year before. Can you talk about the kind of a multi-year basis, how are you thinking about margins at this point? It sounds like you're starting to get some sales force productivity, but you're not getting as much lift from the Research gross margin expanding as you have been in the past. So how should we think about margins the next couple of years here?","Craig Safian","No, you're exactly right, Tim. So the way we've talked about it in the past and the way we think about it rolling forward is as we're approaching the 70% target gross margin for Research, we'll continue to get leverage from that as Research becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the overall pie, and that drives gross margin leverage, but we no longer have the -- going from 60 to 65 to 70 that we've had in the past. The way we will drive EBITDA margins into the future is through increasing sales productivity, which will drive an acceleration to contract value growth. And as we talked about, we need to see productivity get to levels where we are driving Research CV growth in the 15%, 16%, 17% range. When we get there, that's when you'll start to see the margin flow through and the leverage on the SG&A line.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, just on the client retention rate improving, I guess your client growth rate also picked up. I guess, is that mainly the retention rate? Or did you also -- is the -- I guess the new customer additions going up if you kind of separated those 2 factors?","Eugene A. Hall","Tim, it's Gene. So it's both factors. We have a big focus on making sure we retain our clients. And so the fact that the client retention run up is due to all the programs we put in place to drive that retention. Obviously, we keep -- if we keep clients, that helps our overall client growth rate. Having said that, we also have -- we focus on growth as well. We have a lot of programs to drive growth, and those programs have been equally successful to our retention programs. So it will [indiscernible].","Craig Safian","And if you think about it, Tim, 2-point improvement on client retention on a 9,000 enterprise basis gets us a little bit, but the big engine is, as Gene mentioned -- is our new client acquisition.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Craig, just sticking with the margin topic for a second, the -- I think you guys in the past have talked about a longer-term objective sort of mid high 20s maybe in terms of the adjusted EBITDA margin. Does that number seem maybe a little bit too optimistic at this point given the trends you have discussed?","Craig Safian","You know, Peter, as we think about really if we are driving productivity to the levels that we know we're capable of driving and we see the acceleration in contract value growth, we believe the margins will follow that. So we're focused on -- focusing on the key operating levers of the business to drive the business forward. And as those things start kicking in and picking up more acceleration, we should see margin improvement from that.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Okay. Any then -- any granularity or color you can offer in terms of things you're doing to improve further the productivity and maybe the metrics we should be looking at that we could think about to measure that?","Eugene A. Hall","Peter, it's Gene. So the key things we're doing to drive sales productivity, first, it's making sure that when we hire new salespeople, that we hire salespeople that are good with Gartner and good with kind of skills needed to sales success with our clients. Because when we hire the right salespeople, they just do fantastically well. They stay us -- stay with us for a long part of their career, et cetera. So first piece is hiring the right people. We've got a big focus on that. Second piece then is when we bring them on board, we have a -- what I think is the best training program I've ever seen in sales. And that whole training program gets them up to speed as well. We also then have development programs for managers as we have new managers; for vice presidents, as we have new vice presidents, et cetera, to help them improve their skills. And then, finally, we have a whole set of programs that are designed to provide our salespeople with the best possible tools to improve their productivity. And, as a company, our big focus is on innovating in all 3 of those areas, innovating in terms of how we make sure we hire people that are going to be wildly successful with Gartner; innovating in terms in how we train and develop them, so they achieve their full potential; and thirdly, innovating and making sure that we provide them the best possible tools. And every year we get better, and fundamentally that what's driving our sales productivity.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, great. And then last thing. Gene, it was either you or Craig said something specifically about how you continue to explore strategic alternatives to deploy the cash. I'm just wondering what that means.","Eugene A. Hall","Well, as you know, Peter, our number one priority in deploying cash is to do strategic acquisitions and we have a little team that -- we have a team that focuses on tracking a sizable number of acquisition candidates that we think all would have great strategic fits with the company. And so -- our #1 priority continues to be looking for strategic acquisitions. 2014, we made some acquisitions and we are hopeful that in the future that will be an important part of our strategy as well. Then the second one is obviously share buybacks, which is our second strategic use of capital.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Okay. So the word strategic alternatives were not meant to imply some radical or dramatic change in what you've thought about historically. That was just sort of a little thing that jumped out to me.","Craig Safian","Apologies for that. No, it's consistent with our capital deployment strategy that we've been operating on for the last several years.","Operator","Your next audio question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could help us better understand the relationship between currency and tax rate, just so that we can get a handle on that part of the equation should the tax rate change again.","Craig Safian","Sure. Good question, Joe. So I'll try and keep it as simple as I can. So our global tax structure is essentially impacted by 2 streams of income: income in the U.S.; and income from outside of the U.S. This is important because certain jurisdictions outside of the U.S., tax income at much lower rates than the U.S. And so as you'd imagine, the mix of those 2 streams can have a big impact on the effective tax rate. What we experienced in Q4 and are projecting into 2015 is essentially the following. The strengthening U.S. dollars means our overseas profits are lower in -- or smaller in U.S. dollar terms. And a smaller mix of overseas profits, as a percent of the global profit, adversely affects the effective tax rate.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just on the sales force productivity and how it relates to contract value, it seems like you're expecting the growth rates to sort of be sustained next year. Is there anything to read into that? I'm sure you'll continue to drive to higher growth rate, but has there been a change in the market? Is that why you're kind of more leaning towards stable versus acceleration again next year or actually this year?","Eugene A. Hall","So -- Joe, it's Gene. So the -- we are optimistic, and we believe we can continue to improve sales productivity. We're going to grow the business 2 ways. One is continue to grow the number of sales people we have. Last year, we grew at -- when you calculate [ph] them, it was 14.49%. We missed rounding to 15 by 1 sales person. But we want to grow in the range of 15% to 20% in terms of our headcount. Then, in addition to that, we believe as we did last year, that the kind of changes I talked about earlier will result in improving sales productivity over time. The approach we've taken in terms of planning is not to assume improvements before they happen. And we're making them and we believe that will happen, but we haven't assumed they're going to happen in our planning.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just last question from me. I know there has been some pockets in prior years of weakness here on the government spending side, but geographically, Europe obviously continues to be challenged. Can you give us any updates on areas where you're keeping a close eye on things outside of currency going into this year?","Eugene A. Hall","So again, on a constant currency basis, we have, as I mentioned, we had double-digit growth in every region in every industry and in every company size range. So we're in -- so, obviously in public sector, we have double-digit growth. Having said that, the selling environment has not improved in the places that are difficult. You mentioned Europe, the selling environment is just as difficult as it's always been. In the public sector, in many cases, the selling environment is just as difficult as it's always been, but we have adapted to that and are achieving great double-digit growth in all of those areas.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Ryan filling in for Manav. Just a question on the sales force hiring. I guess the jobs reports keep getting better, specifically in the U.S. I mean, is there any risk to finding enough high-quality people? It's clearly a focus for you guys. I'm just wondering if the competition for hiring has gotten tougher in the last year or so.","Eugene A. Hall","Ryan, great question. It -- the answer is no. If you look at the total number of salespeople that we get hired in the U.S., it's in the millions and we hire a few hundreds each year. And so our issue is not actually that the job market has gotten worse. It's the same thing as always, which is find those people that are actually great fit with Gartner. And we work hard at that and get better every year. The overall job market situation, macro job market is not a factor for us.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. That -- and on the Consulting side, I know you're kind of expecting it to come back down to historical levels, and 2014 was obviously great. Was there anything that was kind of structural, I guess, specifically, with the Contract Optimization that maybe could continue going forward? Or is it just a onetime pickup? I guess from your conversations with clients, was there anything there, they're leveraging it more and they expect to see that going forward or any color there?","Eugene A. Hall","No, the Contract Optimization business is a -- there's nothing systematic going on there. It's a business that just depends on what the particular clients' deals are, et cetera. And some years, it's the most volatile part of our entire business. It's very small, but it's the most volatile part of our business. And so again, as Craig -- we based our guidance for 2015 on what Craig said earlier. But there's nothing systematic going on there.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Anjaneya Singh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can discuss what's driving your expectations of the 15% sales force growth. It's been towards the lower end of your 15%, 20% target and below that, slightly I mean, just picking it apart, I guess, but below that for Q3 and Q4. I'm just trying to get a sense of, you mentioned that it's due to the hiring that you do in classes, but just trying to get a sense of how much of the lower sales force growth plays into the positive impact on sales force productivity. Or would you say if you grew it towards the higher end, you'd still see this positive trajectory in the productivity that you mentioned?","Craig Safian","Hey, Anj, it's Craig. So just on the productivity side, the way we're measuring it by using beginning of period headcount, that actually shows a 16% improvement since we're marking off of the ending headcount of 2013. And so we actually haven't gotten the benefit in the productivity number of that marginally lower headcount growth you talked about. As Gene mentioned earlier, the 14% in Q4, if you actually do the math and extend out the decimal places you're looking at, you'll see we were within 1 or 2 additional salespeople of being at 15%. And so I think it's roughly noise that we bounced around a little bit below the 15% mark. We're targeting 15% to 20%. We've been achieving roughly 15%, and we believe we can drive the kind of productivity that we've been driving with consistent 15-plus percent growth.","Anjaneya Singh - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then, on the Consulting business, we notice that backlog growth was negative in Q4 after double-digit growth for the first 3 quarters. Could you just talk about the drivers behind that? How much of that is attributable to FX drag? And Consulting utilization is the highest we've seen in a while. Can you discuss how we should think about that metric going forward?","Craig Safian","Yes, it's a great question. So we actually had a great quarter in terms of revenue burn, and that's reflected in both the utilization and the bill rate as well as the annualized revenue for billable. And we were able to do that because of the strong backlog position that we were in coming out of Q2 and Q3. As we look forward, even though the backlog is modestly down on a year-over-year basis, and again there's some impact there due to foreign exchange, what -- we look at the quality of the backlog and we look at the pipeline of future deals. And the combination of the quality of the backlog coupled with the pipeline of Q1 bookings, gives us confident that the trend on our labor-based business will continue.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just want to follow-up on the question about the recruiting and the labor force. I was wondering, is the underlying trend in line with the 15% to 20% you've discussed in the past? And as we think about the growth in total SG&A versus the number of underlying salespeople, are you seeing any changes in the underlying wage pressures?","Eugene A. Hall","So what I -- first of all, in terms of our turnover, our turnover among our salespeople over the last few years have been trending down. It's been having fewer people turn over and it's well within the range we talked about and right kind of where we want it to be. And that's because again we've been -- done a better job of hiring people that are likely to be successful here over time and then providing them with the training tools. And so, the turnover sales force, I think, is at a terrific level. And as I said, over the last few years has been trending down as opposed to getting worse. It's been actually getting better.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the wages, I'm assuming that's not a pressure for you out there.","Eugene A. Hall","So we pay competitive wages. We always have. Gartner is a place that if you want it's a great place to work in sales. We have a great reputation for anybody who wants to be in technology sales. And that reputation and people know kind of how great the market is, the strength of the brand, the things that they get equipped when they come to Gartner, those are all attractive things. Having said that, we also pay competitive rates, and we've not seen a lot of pressure there.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to confirm. You said that the guidance implies flat to slightly up sales productivity, and -- I think. And given that it was much stronger in the back half and it would seem likely that you would sort of lap a lower level in the first half, should we think of that as potentially very conservative? Or are there reasons that that's a good baseline assumption?","Craig Safian","Gary, I think it's -- we calculate the productivity on a rolling 4-quarter basis. And so it captures all 4 quarters of the last year. And as we talked about each quarter, when we looked at on a standalone basis, was actually up significantly over the prior year quarter. So I think that the rolling 4 for 2014 is definitely a good benchmark.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then your comment earlier, Craig, that it would take 15% to 17% CV growth to really see SG&A leverage, is that just a simple math of you're going to grow the sales force at least 15% so you got to see growth in excess of that to get margin leverage basically?","Craig Safian","In its simplest terms, yes, that's exactly right.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one on the cash flow. Is it right to assume that the cash flow is a pretty similar proportion overseas to the 40% that you talked about revenue and costs? And if so, I guess, it implies that you're going to have to borrow $200 million roughly this year to fulfill the buyback program. So I just wanted to confirm that, that is in -- being included in the $15 million to $16 million interest expense forecast you provided.","Craig Safian","Yes, it's a great point. So our cash flow generation looks just like our revenue and expense mix. So roughly 60% in USD, 40% non-USD currency. And our guidance presumes that whatever borrowing activity we need to do to fulfill our business and meet the expectations that we talk about.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Anderson from Stifel.","Jason P. Anderson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","On the Events business, on your guidance there, could you help us out with the number of events? is it going to be flattish? Or you plan on increasing that? And also within those, are there any changes to the events or maybe you're escalating any more up to Symposium level which you obviously get higher revenue and margins off of?","Craig Safian","So as we talked about, we're expecting 65 events in 2015 versus the 64 we delivered in 2014. So modest, modest increase in number of events there, which has been consistent with what we've done over the last several years. And no major plans to convert any events in 2015.","Jason P. Anderson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then also in the 4Q '14, the attendee per event seemed to be down a bit. Is that more of a mix of events? Or is there anything more to that?","Craig Safian","Yes, I wouldn't read too much into that. If you look at just about every metric related to the Events business in the fourth quarter, they're all spectacular, up around 20% growth. So the attendee per event would just be a mix thing. And we were able to get great attendee and exhibitor growth at all of our events in the fourth quarter.","Jason P. Anderson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And on the acquisition front, I was wondering if you could maybe -- I know we've asked this before, but characterize maybe how things are looking in the pipeline. I'm just -- and the reason I ask it again is with the recent -- your increase in liquidity levels in your dry powder, so to speak, I'm just interested in your comments on how that environment is looking.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, it's Gene. The -- our pipeline looks great. We have a very strong acquisition pipeline. As always, it depends on the sellers' interest and willingness and what the pricing is going to be. But in terms of pipeline of targets that would be great strategic fits, would be terrific for the company, we have a very robust pipeline.","Jason P. Anderson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And just one more little add on to that. Has that changed from as it is now versus maybe 6 months ago, 12 months ago?","Eugene A. Hall","I'd say, there's no change. We've a had robust pipeline 6 months ago. We have a robust pipeline now.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Bird from FBR.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","In Consulting, could you talk about why the business showed a negative incremental margin in Q4? And then, as you look at kind of overall guidance, what do you think is required to hit the upper end of your earnings guidance range for the year?","Craig Safian","So on your first question, the real reason was a lower Contract Optimization revenue in fourth quarter as compared to fourth quarter of 2013. So that's the prime driver for the margin there. In terms of your question around guidance, as always, we take a consistent approach to how we develop our operating plans and our guidance. The high-end would be we see acceleration and productivity, we outperform our initial plans across each of our business units and things of that nature. So consistent with years past, we put a range that we think is attainable on both sides. And the other piece that could actually play in there obviously is FX. And so if the dollar were to weaken, obviously the results would look a little bit different. We're -- we are very focused on making sure we continue to drive very strong double-digit constant currency growth around the world. We operate around the world and we want to drive our business to grow double-digits in euros and pounds and yen and what have you. That's where we're really focused on. But top end would be things outperform modestly and potentially a little bit of a benefit from foreign exchange.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And finally, could you give us a refresher on, I guess, how you think about financial criteria on acquisitions?","Craig Safian","Sure. Before we get to the financial criteria, as you know, we've been very disciplined and diligent around writing checks on acquisitions. And so we really do flex on making sure that it is a great fit strategically, both from a business perspective, from a culture perspective, from a people perspective. And those are very tough thresholds to get across, which is, again, why we've done so few acquisitions over the last several years. From a financial criteria perspective, we are looking for outsized returns on the investment so that we continue to drive shareholder value through that, as well as driving our business organically as well as returning capital to shareholders. But we've got pretty stringent strategic criteria and then fairly stringent or very stringent financial criteria as well.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And is there any specific criteria around whether a deal is immediately accretive or not?","Craig Safian","Bill, it's going to vary based on how strong the fit is and how strong the strategic thrust of a potential target is or strategic fit of a potential target. So we're not going to say that every deal we do, it will be accretive immediately. If it's the right deal for the long term, we'll deal with whatever the short-term ramifications are. But the reality is we look at it as the right deal for the long term, not the short term.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You mentioned the price increase in Research this year was 3% at the low end of the historical 3% to 6% range. Are you seeing any pricing pressure on there? Or is it just specifically because of the stronger U.S. dollar?","Craig Safian","No, we've done 3 to 6. And again when you look at our price increase what it implies is some products were taking up higher than that, and some products lower; some markets higher than that, some products -- or some markets a little bit lower with the average being around 3%. What we found over the last several years is that 3% on average is really a sweet spot for us. If there are opportunities to go higher we go higher. But generally speaking we've been achieving 3% per year for the last several years.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And just a follow-up on the stronger U.S. dollar. You mentioned a 60-40 breakdown in total revenues, U.S. versus non-U.S. Does it dramatically differ by your 3 segments? And if so, how?","Craig Safian","No, it's pretty consistent, amazingly, across the board. That -- there's a little bit of variability there, but by and large, that average roughly applies to each of our 3 business segments.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then within that 40% bucket, again, any specific changes by different divisions?","Craig Safian","No. Our business, as we have it structured, is a very global business and we have people selling and delivering each of those businesses in the local geographies where we do the business. So you won't see a big change. The average is pretty applicable across the entire business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a question for you about the 5-week Academy training program, if you could talk a little bit about where you are in the rollout of that program across the organization.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, we're -- during 2015, it will be rolled out around the world.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So about how -- say, on a percentage basis, about how much is currently -- what's the geographic coverage currently?","Eugene A. Hall","I think if you think about for the salespeople that we are hiring in 2015, all of them will be trained in the academy program. There might be some really just an area, but in general you can think about virtually everybody will be trained in the academy program.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, on the sales force side, if you could talk a little bit about what role inside sales plays in that growth of the sales force headcount and also the impact on sales force productivity.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, we have an inside sales team. Most of our sales force actually is in the field. They both have great productivity numbers. So they're both part of our strategy. But again, the majority of our sales force is in the field.","Operator","At this time, we have no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Brian Shipman for your closing remarks.","Brian Shipman","Thank you, everyone, for being with us on today's Q4 2014 earnings call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Sherief Hassan Bakr - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Jasmine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner's second quarter 2017 earnings call. I'm Sherief Bakr, Head of Investor Relations at Gartner. With me today in Stanford is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.","This call would include a discussion of Q2 2017 financial results as disclosed in today's press release, as well as our updated outlook for 2017. After our prepared remarks, you'll have an opportunity to ask questions. In addition to today's press release, we have provided an accompanying presentation as a reference point for investors and analysts. Both the press release and the presentation are available on our website, investor.gartner.com.","Now before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as other filings with the SEC. I would encourage all of you to review these risk factors listed in these documents.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Gene?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning and welcome to our Q2 earnings call. We delivered another great quarter of double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2017. I continue to be extremely excited about our business, our prospects for growth and our strategy to provide value to our investors over the long term.","Let me begin by reiterating where the combination of Gartner and CEB will create tremendous value. First, our clients need to make critical decisions in a very volatile environment. There is slow macroeconomic growth, volatile commodity prices and exchange rates, political uncertainties such as Brexit. Enterprises around the world address these critical issues with cross-functional teams. The combination of CEB and Gartner lets us help clients address these issues with every function in the business.","In addition, virtually every company in the world is facing technology based disruption. No CEO can be competent without understanding how this impacts their company and their industry. The combination of Gartner's technology expertise plus CEB's business expertise gives us an unprecedented ability to help clients navigate these rapids. Beyond the impact on whole industries, technology is becoming critical in every function of the business. HR can't hire the best people, if they don't use analytics, customer service is negatively impacted if a company doesn't use artificial intelligence, and so on for every function in the business and the pace of technology-driven change is only accelerating. The combination of Gartner plus CEB allows us to help clients fully use technology in every business function.","Finally, Gartner, CEB both had best practices in running their businesses. By combining the best of both operational practices, we will be better than either company was alone. The combination of Gartner plus CEB will provide a quantum leap in our own ability to help clients and in our operational practices.","The combination of CEB and Gartner has other benefits as well. CEB's Evanta events business provides clients with high-value local events that are highly complementary to traditional Gartner destination events, such as Symposium. The combination of CEB and Gartner also brings CEB's Talent Assessment business. Over the next decade and beyond, we expect analytics to become a critical factor in virtually all high-end situations, and CEB is the market leader in this critical space.","Let's now turn to how businesses performed in Q2. Consistent with our previous earnings calls and because of ongoing currency fluctuations globally, we're going to talk about our results in FX-neutral terms. During Q2, the traditional Gartner business accelerated. In the second quarter of 2017, total company revenues increased by 15%. Traditional Gartner contract value growth was also 15%.","We achieved double-digit contract value growth in every region, across every size company and in virtually every industry. Traditional Gartner client retention was at 83%, which is consistent with the second quarter of 2016. Wallet check retention was 105%, which is a point above the same quarter last year.","Both retention metrics are near all-time highs. Increase in sales productivity has been and remains a top priority for us. Over the past few years, we put in a number of programs to improve sales productivity. In Q2, we saw the impact of those programs, with sales productivity improving by 11% organically over the prior year.","In traditional Gartner Consulting, we continue to deepen our research relationships with our largest clients and delivered great value.","For Q2 2017, our Consulting business grew 8%. We continue to grow our Managing Partner strategy and maintained four months of backlog, which is in line with our operational targets.","Our traditional Gartner Events revenues grew 13% in the second quarter of 2017. We hosted 25 events with more than 18,000 attendees compared to roughly 15,000 attendees across the same number of events last year. The Q2 was a strong quarter operationally for traditional Gartner business and we're committed to maintaining this momentum as we integrate with CEB.","Performance of the traditional CEB business was slightly improved during Q2. Contract value in the traditional CEB Research business grew 1%, which is an improvement over the past several quarters. Wallet retention also improved from 93% to 94%.","Revenues for the Talent Assessment segment fell 6%. We believe the decline in revenues was due primarily to a sales force regularization CEB made earlier this year, which integrated Talent Assessment sales with CEB Research sales. Talent Assessment bookings were up modestly year-over-year, as we quickly identified improvement opportunities.","The Gartner CEB post-merger integration is going great. We've taken an aggressive approach to integrating the two companies to concentrate the changes that are likely to be the most disruptive in 2017. This will allow us to a smoother 2018 and beyond. As you may know, we closed the deal in early April. We have already largely completed organizational integration. The Gartner and CEB Research and advisory teams are integrated. The staff functions such as HR and finance are integrated. We've rationalized and integrated the Gartner and CEB sales teams.","One of our biggest growth opportunities is introducing new products. We've already introduced several new products to offer substantially more value to functional business leaders in HR, finance, sales, legal and IT, and additional products will follow in the coming months.","Retention is critical in any subscription business, so we began building service teams to ensure high retention of the new products as well as existing CEB clients. We're committed to achieving double-digit contract value growth in the traditional CEB functional areas, such as HR and finance.","We've grown our sales recruiting teams and have already hired a significant number of new entry-level sales people. With aggressive recruiting plans in place, we plan to enter 2018 with a double-digit growth in the traditional CEB sales force.","We've also changed CEB's traditional commercial terms. CEB's traditional research offerings were generally enterprise agreements, which offer unrestricted access to everyone within the organization. Enterprise agreements offer less value to clients than seat based offerings. As a result, all of our new offerings are seat based. Over time, all the traditional CEB products will be replaced by seat-based products. In the interim, existing CEB products will be sold limitations rather than as enterprise agreements.","CEB often gave clients discounts as an incentive to close business. At Gartner, we found that offering discounts doesn't offer much value to clients and is a distraction from discussing value with them. So, we're phasing out discounting for new clients.","We've integrated the company's event businesses. The CEB destination events have been integrated with the Gartner Events business and we're building exhibitor and ticket sales forces to fully monetize these great events. We've brought an experienced events leader for the Evanta business.","CEB had integrated many aspects of the Talent Assessment business with the CEB Research business. We believe the Talent Assessment business will be much more successful as a standalone business,","analogous to the way we run Gartner Events and Gartner Consulting businesses. As a result, we have un-integrated Talent Assessment business and established it as a standalone business. We've had a strong General Manager for the business who is a senior leader in the SHL Talent Assessment business, before it was acquired by CEB.","While we are combining Gartner and CEB to accelerate growth, there are significant synergies. We've achieved approximately $40 million in projected run rate savings within the first 120 days. As I said previously, we plan to fund some of the investments I described earlier using a portion of these synergies. And of course, there is more work to be done. Specifically, the systems that support the business need to be harmonized and\/or integrated, and we'll capture significant additional run rate savings over the next couple of years.","We built a very aggressive iteration plan and progress to-date has been great. For example, turnover in the traditional CEB sales force has dropped by about 10 percentage points, a significant and important improvement. This sales force is extremely enthusiastic for the exciting new products. We found the quality of research insights produced by traditional CEB to be even more exceptional than we'd initially assessed. We've also found people throughout the organization are extraordinary talented, capable and committed to providing great service to clients.","The leadership changes in the Evanta and Talent Assessment businesses have been well received by associates in those business segments. As I mentioned earlier, we've purposely chosen to move rapidly with integrating CEB and Gartner, we've done this to get the full benefits from integration sooner and to get disruptions we may face completed during 2017. We've also designed the integration program to minimize the impact on the performance of the traditional Gartner business. The strong Q2 results in our traditional Gartner business reflect this approach. The changes I discussed earlier disproportionately impacted the traditional CEB organization. For example, the traditional CEB sales force will need to develop new skills as they begin selling seat-based products rather than enterprise agreements.","Clients often expect discount in any product they buy. The traditional CEB sales team will need to develop their skills selling without discounting. We have plans in place to address these risks. But given the magnitude and pace of change, we could hit some speed bumps with the traditional CEB segments during the second half of 2017.","Also the changes are based on well-proven Gartner operational practices. Over the long-term, we are confident these changes result in strong, sustained double-digit growth in the traditional CEB business areas, just as they have for the traditional Gartner business.","Summarizing, the combination of CEB and Gartner will create a quantum leap in capability and sustained extraordinary growth over the long term. We'll be able to address the mission-critical priorities for every function across the enterprise with leading insights and the best of the two organizations.","During Q2, the performance of the traditional Gartner business continued to accelerate. CEB growth accelerated, retention strengthened, and sales productivity improved at double-digit rates. In addition, the traditional CEB business saw modest improvements. We developed a very aggressive integration plan and it's going great. We've already integrated our organizations, launched new products, introduced new commercial terms, accelerated sales force hiring and set up Talent Assessment as a standalone business. And that's just in the first 120 days and we're just getting started.","With that, I'll turn it to Craig Safian, our Chief Financial Officer.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. In addition to discussing our quarterly performance and updated annual outlook, I'll spend some time this morning walking you through our new reportable segments and other disclosure highlights as a result of the CEB acquisition.","Starting with our reporting segments; as you've all seen from today's press release, we now have four reportable segments, Research, Consulting, Events, as well as Talent Assessment & Other. Starting with Research. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment, representing approximately 72% of our combined full year 2016 company revenues and approximately 80% of total gross contribution. Research comprises the previously-disclosed Gartner Research segment with two additions.","First, approximately 80% of the revenues of what was reported as the CEB segment, these revenues relate to core CEB subscription-based research products and services, which we'll refer to primarily as BPDS. The other and significantly smaller change \u2013 change to the Research segment is that we have also included results related to strategic advisory services or SaaS. These revenues make up about 1% of Research revenues, but were previously included in our Consulting segment. SaaS revenues are principally generated from one- or two-day research analyst engagements requested by our largest clients, for which they pay an additional amount relative to their subscription service.","Correspondingly, Consulting, which represents slightly more than 9% of our full year 2016 combined company revenues and 4% of total gross contribution, now no longer include the SaaS revenues that I just mentioned.","Moving to Events, where we've added CEB's Events business to the Gartner Events business. CEB's Events revenues were predominately comprised of the Evanta asset that was acquired in May 2016. On a full year 2016 basis, Events represented approximately 9% of our combined revenues and 8% of total gross contribution.","Finally, we've added a new reportable segment, Talent Assessment & Other, which we'll often call TA & Other. This segment is made up of CEB's Talent Assessment business plus the remaining 20% of CEB's segment revenues that are not included in our core research segment. These revenues are related to ancillary CEB Research products and services such as training, workforce surveys and leadership academies. TA & Other represented approximately 9% of our combined 2016 revenues and 8% of total gross contribution.","For modeling and comparability purposes, we are also providing historical revenues, adjusted revenues and contribution margin for the combined company in our full reportable segments for the four quarters of 2016, as well as Q1 2017. This information along with an in-depth overview of our Q2 performance is available in the two documents we have furnished to accompany this call, both located on our Investor Relations website.","While we have folded CEB into our reportable segments and added a new one, we are committed to providing the financial community with the appropriate level of transparency to be able to track the performance of the core CEB Research business. In addition, we want to provide transparency to be able to continue to attract the performance of the traditional Gartner business.","On last quarter's call, I mentioned that we were in the process of harmonizing calculation methodologies to make key CEB metrics comparable and aligned with Gartner metrics.","As an example, for the traditional Gartner business, our total contract value metric represents the annualized value of all our subscription-based contracts. While, CEB did report contract value, we have now recast that measure to be aligned with how we've traditionally done it with the Gartner business. In doing so, we have excluded certain CEB products and services that do not meet the criteria of our CV definition.","You'll find the historical details of the recast contract value on slide 19 in our earnings presentation. Similarly, we have harmonized how we calculate wallet retention to also be consistent with how we calculate retention at Gartner. I will come back and discuss the trends of these metrics in a few minutes as a part of my quarterly segment review.","We will also discuss our top-line results using both GAAP revenue and adjusted revenue. The only difference is that adjusted revenue excludes the deferred revenue fair value adjustment that is required as a part of purchase accounting. Turning to our Q2 performance, our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included total combined company adjusted revenue growth of 9%, driven by 13% growth for the traditional Gartner business and a 3% decline for the acquired CEB business.","Combined adjusted EBITDA $185 million and combined adjusted diluted EPS of $0.88 per share, above the top end of our guidance range for the quarter. Please note that our second quarter 2017 GAAP revenues of $844 million, includes an approximately $91 million deferred revenue adjustment. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our revenue for the quarter was $935 million. Our exceptional business model continues to create a consistently high level of free cash flow conversion.","On a rolling four quarter basis with three quarters of standalone Gartner and one quarter of Gartner plus CEB, our reported free cash flow conversion was 118% of adjusted net income. However, if we calculate free cash flow conversion on a rolling four quarter basis for the combined company, our free cash flow conversion would have been 126% through Q2.","I'll now discuss our second quarter combined business segment and P&L in depth, highlighting the performance of the traditional Gartner and acquired CEB business where appropriate, before turning to our balance sheet and cash flow dynamics. I will then close with remarks on our updated 2017 guidance, which incorporates our new reportable segments. We will then be happy to take your questions.","Please note that my segment discussion will focus on the adjusted revenue and adjusted contribution margin performance in Q2, therefore, adding back the deferred revenue fair value adjustment I just mentioned. Please also note that we've included a lot of this information in the presentations on our IR website.","Beginning with Research. On a combined basis, adjusted Research revenue grew 11% in the second quarter. The adjusted gross contribution margin for Research was 68% or a 130 basis point decline compared to the second quarter of 2016 on a comparable basis. This modest decline is primarily due to our newer acquired businesses such as Capterra, SCM World and L2 having lower gross contribution margins than traditional business.","Adjusted revenues for the traditional Gartner Research business increased by 15% in the second quarter. Acquisitions, primarily L2 and SCM World had a slightly less than 2 point impact on the traditional Gartner Research adjusted revenue growth for the quarter.","Our other traditional Gartner Research business metrics also remained very strong with accelerating contract value growth, accelerating sales productivity and improvements in our retention metrics.","Total contract value was almost $2 billion as of the end of Q2, FX-neutral growth of 15% versus the prior year, and an acceleration from the growth we delivered last quarter. For reference and comparison, our Q2 2016 total contract value at current-year FX rates was $1.73 billion.","On an organic basis, excluding the contribution of L2, which we acquired in March 2017, total contract value growth for traditional Gartner Research would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, also an acceleration from the growth we delivered last quarter.","We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth of new business. From a traditional Gartner Research perspective, client retention was 83%, up 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2016, and up slightly on a sequential basis. Wallet retention ended at 105% for the quarter, up by almost a point year-on-year and 50 basis points on a sequential basis. Both of our retention figures are close to our all-time highs.","New business growth for traditional Gartner Research remained strong, up 14% year-on-year in Q2. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. And as always, we also benefit from our consistent price increases.","Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises. We ended the first quarter with 11,164 enterprise clients, up 7% compared to Q2 2016. The average spend for enterprise also continues to grow. It now stands at $179,000 per enterprise, up 8% versus prior year on an FX neutral basis. This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth through both new and existing enterprises.","Turning to sales productivity for the traditional Gartner Research sales force. Over the last rolling four quarters, we delivered $265 million of FX-neutral net contract value increase or NCVI. When divided by our beginning of period head count, which was 2,297 quota-bearing heads, our rolling four quarter productivity per account executive was $116,000.","Excluding the impact of the L2 acquisition, sales productivity was up 11% year-on-year and 5% sequentially. As always, we remain highly focused on improving our sales productivity and remain confident that the initiatives we have implemented to drive productivity will positively impact the results of both the short and long-term.","Turning to the performance of CEB Research in the quarter; CEB adjusted research revenues declined by 1% year-on-year in Q2, an improvement from the 4% year-on-year decline in Q1. CEB's other research metrics also improved in the quarter. Contract value converted to Gartner's methodology was $578 million, a 1% year-on-year increase on an FX neutral basis, compared to a 1% decline in the first quarter. In addition, wallet retention also using Gartner's methodology ended the quarter at 94%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.","Moving to Events. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, our Events segment now includes the former CEB Events business, which is essentially the Evanta asset that CEB acquired in 2016, as well as CEB's destination events, which include the ReimagineHR and CEB's sales and marketing summits.","The traditional Gartner Events business as you know holds more than 60 large destination events, such as our Symposium series for CIOs. Evanta holds approximately 200 smaller community-led events that don't require the attendees to travel.","On a combined basis, adjusted Events revenues increased by 10% year-on-year in Q2. Events' second quarter adjusted gross contribution margin was 56%, down by approximately 200 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. While CEB Events revenue was approximately flat on a year-on-year basis, the traditional Gartner Events business had a very strong quarter in Q2, with a 13% year-on-year increase in same-event revenue, a more than 100 basis point year-on-year improvement in contribution margin, and an 18% increase in same-event attendees.","Turning to Consulting, on a comparable basis, second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 6% on a reported basis and 8% FX-neutral, driven by a strong performance in our contract optimization business.","On the labor-based side, global head count of 667 was up 7%, and we had 128 managing partners at the end of Q2, a 14% increase over the year-ago quarter.","Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for Consulting business, ended the quarter at $91 million, down 1% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. Consistent with our new segment presentation, please note that our Consulting backlog no longer includes the backlog associated with SaaS.","Consulting gross contribution margin increased by 160 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to the strong performance of the contract optimization business.","Turning to TA & Other. Adjusted revenue in the TA & Other segment declined by 6% compared to the year-ago quarter. This was primarily due to a continuation of recent trends at TA. In addition, and as Gene commented, we moved quickly to address some of TA's legacy organizational issues, which we believe will drive improved performance going forward. Encouragingly, we did see some improved momentum towards the end of the quarter and ended Q2 with higher year-on-year bookings for the quarter.","Moving down the income statement. On a combined basis, SG&A increased by 10% year-over-year in the second quarter. Our sales force continues to be our largest investment and as of the end of the second quarter, the traditional Gartner business had 2,574 quota-bearing sales associates. This is an increase of 277 or 12% from a year ago, and we continue to plan for approximately 13% sales head count growth for the traditional Gartner business in 2017.","The acquisition of CEB adds more than 500 quota-bearing research sales associates. While this is essentially flat on a year-on-year basis, as Gene mentioned, we have already started to grow sales head count and we'll leverage our proven best practices around recruiting, training and tools to drive accelerated CV growth and improved productivity.","As a growth company and now as a much larger growth company, we also continue to invest in areas such as recruiting, technology, facilities and other areas to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long-term. At the same time, we're making good progress on cost synergies related to the CEB acquisition, specifically in G&A functions.","Given the investments we have already made and plan to make through the balance of the year to drive accelerated growth in CEB's contract value, we continue to expect very modest net synergy flow through in 2017. We remain on track to deliver on our 2018 cost synergy target and are working very diligently to harvest as much of the $50 million as possible in 2018.","Moving down the income statement; depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter, predominantly reflecting the addition of CEB, while amortization and integration charges were up significant, again related to the transaction. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 35.4%. Adjusting for acquisition and non-recurring charges, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.9%. A lower than expected adjusted tax rate positively impacted our Q2 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04. This was primarily due to the timing of certain tax costs that are expected to be realized in the remainder of the year. We continue to expect our full year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% to 34% and approximately 32% to 33% on an adjusted basis.","GAAP diluted earnings per share was negative $1.03 in the second quarter. Our GAAP EPS figure also includes $1.91 of non-GAAP adjustments. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our EPS in Q2 was $0.88 or $0.03 above the high-end of our guidance range, helped by the lower adjusted tax rate I just referenced. Normalizing for this, our adjusted EPS would have been approximately $0.84 in the quarter.","Turning now to cash; in Q2, operating cash flow was $112 million compared to $148 million for the standalone Gartner business in the year-ago quarter.","As I commented last quarter, CEB has historically had different cash flow seasonality at Gartner, where CEB's strongest cash flow quarter has been Q1, followed by its weakest quarter in Q2. On a combined basis, operating cash flow increased by 1% in Q2. It is also important to note that our Q2 operating cash flow includes significant acquisition and integration payments, which we adjust out for our free cash flow calculation.","Pivoting the free cash flow, Q2 2017 CapEx was $31 million and Q2 cash acquisition and integration payments were $48 million, compared to less than $1 million in Q2 2016. This yields Q2 free cash flow of $129 million, approximately 50% higher when compared to combined company free cash flow in Q2 2016. The timing of our contract value growth is a key driver of our quarterly free cash flow performance and our strong research results from March and across Q2 have begun converting to free cash flow.","Turning to the balance sheet; we had a busy quarter related to the CEB acquisition, which closed in early April. If you recall, on last quarter's call, I focused my comments on our post-close balance sheet rather than the end of March snapshot.","Relative to the approximately $3.6 billion of gross debt we had as of April 5, we have repaid more than $160 million by the end of Q2, with a quarter-ending gross debt level of approximately $3.5 billion. From a net debt perspective, we had approximately $2.9 billion at the end of Q2, which translates to approximately 4.1 times leverage on a pro forma combined last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA.","Given the favorable cash flow characteristics of the combined company, we remain firmly on schedule to de-lever to approximately three times gross leverage within the first two to three years of closing the acquisition.","Turning to guidance; slide 13 of the presentation provides you with our updated outlook for 2017. As is our practice, our EPS guidance is on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. At a high level, our combined adjusted revenue outlook is unchanged, while we have tightened our full year adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and EPS outlook ranges. In addition, we have also updated our segment guidance to reflect our new reporting structure, which incorporates the CEB acquisition. And I'll also remind you that our full year guidance includes 12 months of Gartner plus 9 months of CEB results.","Starting with revenue; for 2017, we continue to expect combined company adjusted revenue of between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion. This is comprised of the following. For Research, we expect combined adjusted revenues of between $2.57 billion and $2.62 billion. For the traditional Gartner Research business, we expect to continue our trend of mid-teen revenue growth in 2017. This is obviously supported by the very strong contract value growth we just reported.","For Consulting, we expect revenues of between $319 million and $334 million, which essentially reflects the shift in SaaS revenue from the Consulting segment to the Research segment. For Events, we expect adjusted revenues of between $328 million and $347 million. For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $214 million and $226 million.","Again, these are adjusted revenue ranges, you will find the reconciliation of our adjusted revenue guidance ranges to GAAP revenue on slide 14 of the presentation.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA; as mentioned, we've narrowed our expected adjusted EBITDA range for 2017, trimming the high end of our previous guidance range by $15 million. This modest reduction to the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance is driven by two factors. First, the vast majority of our change is due to our decision to accelerate certain frontline investments in areas that will fuel CEB's growth for the future. Given the rapid progress we have made so far with the CEB integration, we are confident of the incremental benefit this will yield going forward. The other and smaller change is to our outlook for the Evanta and Talent Assessment businesses, where we've had to focus on fortifying the structures we have acquired to set them up for future growth.","As I commented last quarter, our GAAP 2017 earnings per share is expected to be significantly impacted by acquisition and integration charges, of which the vast majority are non-cash in nature.","Slide 15 of the presentation reconciles the per share difference between our updated GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. We now expect the after-tax of these adjustments to total approximately $4.26 at the midpoint of our guidance. Putting this altogether, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted EPS of between $3.32 and $3.49 per share.","Slide 17 details the key assumptions below EBITDA that we've used to calculate our updated adjusted EPS outlook. Given that our below-the-line assumptions are essentially unchanged, I won't take you through them in detail.","For our tax rate, we continue to project an annual effective rate for GAAP of approximately 33% to 34% and for adjusted earnings of approximately 32% to 33%. In addition, our tax rate may also vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the projected geographic mix of earnings, the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to stock-based awards, as well as the timing of certain items.","Finally, our EPS guidance is based on a weighted average fully-diluted share count of approximately 89.5 million to 90.5 million shares for the full year 2017.","Turning to our Q3 guidance; for the third quarter of 2017, we expect GAAP EPS of between negative $0.67 and negative $0.72. This includes approximately $1.20 per share of non-GAAP adjustments, predominantly related to acquisition charges. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.48 and $0.52 per share for the third quarter 2017. To provide some additional color on expected seasonal trends, third quarter is typically a seasonally light events quarter from both the traditional Gartner and CEB Events perspective, followed by a seasonally-strong Q4, where we typically generate half of our annual Events revenue.","In closing, we had a strong start to the year and we expect this performance to continue throughout the balance of 2017. Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth and contract value growth was 15%. We also saw acceleration in our CV growth, sales productivity and retention measures. Our Events business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017 and Consulting delivered another quarter of growth following a very strong year-ago quarter.","From a standalone Gartner perspective, our 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook is largely unchanged and we expect to continue our trend of double-digit growth. The addition of CEB further strengthens our ability to capture the best market opportunity ahead of us, as we are now able to address the mission-critical priorities of virtually all functional business leaders across every industry and size of enterprise worldwide. And the deal was immediately accretive to our bottom-line.","As Gene mentioned, the integration is going exceptionally well. We set aggressive timelines, and we are achieving or beating them. This has given us the confidence to accelerate a number of investments, such as growing the CEB sales force to accelerate our ability to capture the vast market opportunity that exists. And it's important to note, we've done all of that while driving acceleration of performance in the traditional Gartner business.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, thank you. Sounds like a lot of good things going on and a lot of positives from the CEB. So I guess the one negative surprise was the Evanta and Talent Assessment business, but it's nothing to do with the value prop of the business relative to expectations, it's just like some other things at CEB, how it was operated in execution, and you've identified that and are making the changes?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Jeff, it's Gene. Yeah. So, that's a very fair characterization. Both businesses are terrific, I'll take Evanta first. Evanta is a business that we do very well. In fact, when CEB bought it, we would have liked to have bought it and so it's a terrific business, very complementary. CEB did not have \u2013 we have probably the world's leading Events business, CEB was not really in the Events business and didn't run it as effectively as it could have we think.","And so in any event, we've got a great leader for the business, we've made a bunch of operational changes and we think that's going to be a great source of future growth. But again, it's a business we do very well anyway, so we're excited about that.","Talent Assessment is a similar story, which is as I said in my remarks, Talent Assessment is an area that we think to look out over the next decade and beyond, it's a huge growth area because every company is going to be using analytics to hire.","And our Talent Assessment business is the market leader in that space and there are some businesses that should be integrated with Research and some that'll be separate. CEB had made the decision to try and integrate it and we don't think it worked that great. We've set up a standalone business, got a great leader for it and in fact as I mentioned, the bookings actually is on a good track, so the revenues were a little disappointing, but that's obviously for bookings in the past. The bookings, actually, we're on a good track and we're quite optimistic about the business.","Just another example there is there are a lot of open sales territories, which obviously you don't sell as much in open sales territories, we'll fix those kinds of problems.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then on the \u2013 I guess you're ahead of plan for the integration, so you have the footing in place to start to accelerate the investments and especially the sales force growth sooner than expected at CEB, so that's the other I guess change if I'm characterizing that correctly, and can you give us any sense I think you said exit with 10% growth at the CEB sales force head count. Was there any prior expectation just in terms of sizing up how much you're accelerating things?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, the \u2013 overall integration of CEB is going extraordinarily well. It's going \u2013 when you plan these things before the deal, you plan a certain way; things have gone very well. So, as I mentioned, organizationally we're essentially 100% integrated, and the most important, the biggest opportunity is we've already introduced new integrated products, which we're quite excited about and the sales force is quite excited about. We've gotten sales force turnover and the CEB sales force is down already, because they're excited about being part of the sales-driven company and also the new offerings, et cetera. And in addition to that, we've started ramping up hiring of salespeople at a faster rate than we might have thought beforehand, just because things have gone quite well. And so, what I said in my remarks is that we expect to enter 2018 with double-digit growth in the CEB traditional sales force area.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And Jeff, it's Craig. The additional color I'd add is we always contemplated in our longer term \u2013 mid-term and longer term business case, absolutely growing the CEB sales force over time, given the size of the market opportunity. I think given everything we've seen in the first 120 days, it gave us the confidence to actually pull that forward, because as Gene mentioned, the integration was going exceptionally well. We were able to actually get new products out in market sooner than we thought. And so, given all of that, we decided to pull forward essentially the investment in growing that CEB sales force.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, that all makes a lot of sense. And then are you willing to start providing any sense of how you're thinking about the TAM for the CEB business at this point?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, we're not going to put any quantification on it yet, we'll do \u2013 we'll probably do that at Investor Day early next year. But the way \u2013 one way to think about it is we believe that \u2013 so if you look at the functions in a typical enterprise, things like IT, HR, sales, et cetera. There are some functions that are comparable sized in terms of number of people, budget in the organization as IT or maybe even bigger. So like in a lot of companies, the sales force and the sales spending could be as big or bigger than the IT budget. HR is often is comparable to the IT budget. And so as we look at it, a lot of the new functions that we're getting with CEB have the potential to be as big or even bigger than the IT market; other functions are smaller. So legal for example, wouldn't have as many people or as big a budget, so it would definitely it will be smaller.","So I think there are number of functions which we think have very huge opportunity \u2013 actually all of them have huge opportunities. Some are typical IT or even bigger, and some of will be a little bit smaller, again we'll size that more precisely next year at Investor Day is kind of our intention.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Please proceed.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Craig, I guess the first question, so the Q3 guidance is quite a bit below what we were expecting. Can you give us any incremental color on the cadence of spending or other factors that would be impacting the level of profitability next quarter?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Gary. I think it's actually really a seasonality thing in terms of the calendar of the events schedule. So if you think about our business, spending is pretty consistent on a quarter-over-quarter basis, given the bulk of our spending relates to people on board. We've always had a skew that showed Q1 and Q3 as our lightest profit quarters and that's really driven by our events calendar with Q2 and Q4 being bigger event revenue quarters. We've only compounded that with the CEB acquisition, where the Evanta business is predominantly a Q2 and Q4 revenue generator. And in Q1 and Q3, there's essentially no revenues but we are carrying cost related to the team that delivers those events.","And so I think, essentially it's just we are now just a little bit more heavily weighted in Q4 given the Evanta business. And the other thing I'd mention is last year's Q4, we did not perform as we wanted to on the Events business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're actually back on track on our Events business. So, we actually expect to deliver nice growth in Events contribution in Q4 as well. So, it's really those two factors.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. And then, Gene, you acknowledged the potential for some, I think, you called them speed bumps within the CEB segment as you push through all these positive changes. Is that \u2013 can you give us a sense as to \u2013 is that largely sales related and will that impact Research or could \u2013 where would that come and how \u2013 any way to size what would be I guess is what I'm getting at. Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, as you mentioned, we're making a lot of operational changes, which are really proven practices that we've done at Gartner and have really been key to the great double-digit growth we've had over such a long period of time. So, we want to implement those things at CEB, we expect that it's going to have the same results with CEB. It will get us that kind of double-digit growth rate. As you mentioned, I said there might be \u2013 so far we've not hit speed bumps, but it's certainly prudent to believe that as you make these changes that there could be some speed bumps that you hit along the way. It could be anywhere in the business, but I think the one that would be most likely would be in sales where again the sales people have to develop new skills along the lines in particular in two areas. One is, Gartner sells seat-based products, by the way, we went through this transition when we first went Gartner was enterprise agreements and we \u2013 so we know how to transition from enterprise to seat-based, but it does require different skills in terms of how you talk to clients and explain the value. And then secondly, the whole discounting where we've established a policy our clients understand, we don't discount, let's focus on the value that you're getting from the product, but that's how most companies operate, including the way CEB did, and so I think those two areas could impact sales, haven't seen anything yet, but we think it certainly could happen.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And Gary, specifically it would be an impact probably most acutely on new business. From a retention perspective, we're working with our clients, we're making sure they're engaged and getting value and we'll continue to renew them, and as you saw, we actually saw a modest uptick in the wallet retention rate for CEB. So, the speed bump potential, again these aren't huge speed bumps, these are probably smaller speed bumps, but is really on the new business side. We're in...","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then...","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","I other thing I'd say, Gary, in terms of the risk is the sales force the CEB sales force, we've taken these changes, they totally understand why we wanted these changes, why it gives them more better market opportunity and are I think quite enthusiastic about the changes, and so, but we do think despite all the things sort of looking very positive, we do think it's prudent that something we could have some speed bumps. (50:40) also on retention, we're quite optimistic.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That makes sense. And then just one last quick one on that retention point, I think you've highlighted this from the beginning as one of the biggest opportunities, have you put in your \"model\" or is that something that we should think takes longer to really begin to \u2013 I realize it'll take a while to show up in the numbers, but is that one of the things you've been able to do quickly? Thank you.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","We've started putting them on and we've also discovered some great news with it, which is when CEB clients have the same level of engagements as Gartner clients, they have the same retention rates. And so we have a lot of confidence that as we put these programs in place that there is no reason CEB retention shouldn't be as good as Gartner retention. We've already started doing those and again as you can tell we've started seeing those results. We're not done, there's still a lot of work to be done, but we're well on the path.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please proceed.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks. I was wondering, you mentioned some of the change to the outlook for guidance, it was kind of two dimensions, a little bit of it was Evanta and SHL and some of the, I forget how you phrased it, but changes you made there. I guess, can you quantify that aspect of it versus the other part, how much of the change in outlook is from each?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Hey, good morning, Tim. The way to think about it is, I think the majority of the change relates to us accelerating investments that we believe will drive great long-term value. So, think in the 60%, 70% of the change, balance related to some softness on TA and Evanta revenues. And also, quite frankly, investing with the right leadership and filling out the team so that we can actually deliver over the long-term in those two businesses as well, but think roughly 60%, 70% on the acceleration investment, balance on fortifying the TA and Evanta businesses.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And the accelerated investments, I know you \u2013 it's early to think about 2018 at this point, I guess, but is this is a pull forward in spending from 2017 or from 2018 to 2017 or is this a pull forward, I guess, in the context of a kind of a medium-term increase investment outlook? Just trying to think of, do we get back some of the spending we're looking at here in 2018 or is this a couple of years now before we kind of recoup and get back to maybe the margin levels that you otherwise would have expected?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","So, Tim, I think that the way to think about it is the acceleration on the investment are some of the things that Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks, so probably the biggest one related to actually starting to grow the sales force, again where CEB Research sales had been flattish, the number of head count over the last several years. And so, again we always contemplated as a part of our business case that because of that market opportunity, we talked about it a little bit earlier that we would be consistently growing the CEB sales force over time.","The reason why we've pulled forward the investment or actually the better way to articulate it is, we started the investment a little bit earlier than we had originally contemplated is that number one, integration was going really, really well and we saw the opportunity to do that. Number two, if we get them onboard and trained over the course of 2017, while there'll still be new sales people, who inherently have lower productivity, they will actually yield some benefit in 2018.","But again, you know the cycle of how, when we hire new sales people in year one, they're less productive, in year two they're a little bit more productive and then by the year three they typically look like a fully-tenured sales person. So in essence, we pulled forward the training and the hire \u2013 recruiting and training so that we can start the journey a little bit sooner than we had originally contemplated.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one last one if I could, from an operating metric standpoint, I just want to, I guess, understand what you're saying, Craig, are you going to give us at least for a little while here the CEB versus the Gartner \u2013 legacy Gartner contributions to these new segments or is this kind of the last quarter where we see that? And then what should we expect from the kind of the operating metrics standpoint? Are we going to get sales head count and so forth separately for Gartner versus CEB and same thing with wallet retention and so forth?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question, Tim. The \u2013 what I can tell you is, through the end of 2017, we will breakout contract value growth and wallet retention for the traditional Gartner business and the traditional CEB business. It's harder to do the breakouts on revenues, segment expense and contribution margin. So we'll try and focus on the key operating measures so that we can show you progress both on the traditional Gartner side and on the traditional CEB side.","As Gene mentioned, we all are fully integrating across the board, and that makes pulling and parsing some of this a little bit more difficult. As we head into 2018, there are some shifts in terms of CEB had a technology business selling to CIOs and technology professionals. We've already integrated that into the Gartner technology sales force. And we had a supply chain and marketing sales organization, and we're integrating that into the what was the traditional CEB sales force.","So, the fidelity gets a little hard to track. That said, we'll figure out the right way to provide transparency and progress on was the traditional Gartner business maybe with a few tweaks based on those integration adjustments I mentioned and on the traditional CEB business, again with a couple of tweaks to reflect how we've actually integrated and are running the business.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Gene, the first question I had, you've always been positive and bullish about these deals. But I guess, some of the choice of words today were pretty forceful in terms of tremendous value, quantum leap, aggressive approach, et cetera, et cetera. So, I was just wondering this early into the integration, was it just that you found a lot of the easy loopholes that you didn't think you would find to fix CEB or broadly maybe you can just help understand those choice of voice?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, great question. So, CEB before we bought them was a public company. And as such didn't give us a lot of access to their people or their internal information. We essentially had no access until after we closed, which was again four months ago, so it wasn't that long ago. And we did a lot of work beforehand actually as you know over a decade with customer research, research you can get on the outside, but having done it you don't know until after the acquisition how enthusiastic associates are going to be, you don't know kind of the internal data like we talked about how we calculate client retention versus how they calculate is a little bit different. And so while beforehand, we were quite enthusiastic and obviously believe to create a tremendous amount of value, what we found \u2013 as we closed the deal and gotten access to the inside information and I actually talked to the associates, we found that it's actually even better than we thought it was going to be. And so that's why you \u2013 and the second thing, because of that is, that we're going faster than we had laid out originally before we had all the inside information that we have now.","It's the combination of things like the sales forces' enthusiasm for the new products and for being a part of Gartner and the operational improvements from combining the research advisory organizations between Gartner and CEB and the fact that things like I mentioned a moment ago, that all the facts, the internal facts that we now have that we didn't have (59:46) say, if we do the same retention programs with CEB clients, we should get the same results in retention, the same high, great results for retention as we've gotten with Gartner.","And so we didn't have all the data beforehand and while the indicators were very positive, we found in this particular case that things were even better than we thought. We've also developed specific operational plans, I'm going to give an example, we want to grow the sales force, one of the things to growing the sales force is we had to make sure there was manager capacity in order to actually have higher growth. We didn't know that before we bought CEB. Now, we actually understood where there's manager capacity and have identified as I mentioned earlier that we believe we can get double-digit growth from the sales force, enter 2018 with double-digit growth in sales force we know we're going to put the sales people, but who is going to manage them, where we're going to get the hiring from, that's stuff that we just couldn't know ahead of time, and so we had to be more \u2013 take a more cautious approach before we actually had the internal facts.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fine. That makes sense. And then just on the Talent Assessment or TA side of the stuff, I think since CEB acquired it, it's sort of been disappointing for us to see that performance not get any better. I mean you talked about HR analytics being something over the next decade that \u2013 you have a lot of other stuff going on in there. So \u2013 I mean in your company rather. So, I mean maybe what can you do with TA, is that going to be a focus area, maybe just some more color there?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, where we start from is the TA business, the market itself is a great place to be because again, in fact, we use analytics extensively internally at Gartner, we do this really well. And we believe, as I said over the next decade, every company will be using analytics to hire, and CEB, our Talent Assessment business is that market leader and so sort of intrinsic there are really well.","There were a number of internal operational problems that they had. So for example, open sales territories. That was one problem, obviously we don't sell much in open sales territories. The other one is, significantly delayed, I think, years of new products introductions that now have been introduced. Client retention programs, really the same kind of retention programs, you're going to do same thing at Talent Assessment as we have in our Research business.","And so there are a number of operational improvements that we see that we believe this business over time will be a great business. And in fact, I'm encouraged by the fact that our bookings actually, I wouldn't call 1% growth of booking is good, but it's better than what they had had previously and I'm quite optimistic as we fill territories, as we introduce new products, as we put retention programs in place, this business has great potential.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just last question maybe new products and stuff that you mentioned around CEB. I mean are those being marketed just to the traditional CEB customers or could we see some of these products being highlighted at your symposiums or whatever in terms of the cross-sell?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, it's both. So we have already introduced these, these are in the market today. So I'll use IT for example. So CEB had a set of \u2013 had research and a research and advisory team that focused on only CIOs and obviously Gartner did as well. When we look at it, the specific offerings, this is another area that we've been very pleased is that the specific offerings even in area like IT are highly complementary where CEB had many more things like case studies and user-generated benchmarks that actually Gartner client has been asking us for, for years and so we've actually put all of the CEB Research and advisory resources together with the Gartner and created new product that has a separate brand and in fact will be offered to all of our \u2013 we're going to go back and try to upgrade all our existing Gartner clients and of course it'll be for sale to all the new Gartner clients. That's on the IT side.","If you then go to places like HR, we've taken CEB's great research, which say \u2013 in HR, which is it's the world \u2013 just like we are in IT, they are in HR, but they weren't as good as the technology. Well, Gartner had a much of technology research that relates to HR people, things like should you use Workday, how do you implement it things like \u2013 Workday is an HR tool for companies to use that's typically chosen and run by the HR department.","So, in any event, so obviously Gartner had a lot more expertise in the technology side in HR, CEB had the world's best business expertise in HR. We've actually put all that together in a combined offering that's better than either company had before, that's in the market today. So, the IT product I mentioned before is in the market today, so is the HR product and we've done the same thing for finance and other areas of the business, the areas I mentioned earlier.","And so, these products are actually \u2013 they are seat-based and they actually have research, all of them have research from both companies, so it's better than anything that was available previously.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate the time and details.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, I was hoping you could share some thoughts on the improvement you guys have shown in the early days on CEB CV growth and wallet retention. It seems like there is some stabilization that's going on maybe that re-tooling of contract structure and even sales force is driving this. But is there any noise that we should be aware of around this improvement in the early days? Just trying to get a sense of whether this trajectory is somewhat permanent in your view or could the speed bumps referenced cause them to worsen again in the early days?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, I guess \u2013 Anj, this is Gene, the way I would characterize it is that the changes we're making on things like the \u2013 the best products, the best of both products I just mentioned, improved retention programs, the way we manage the sales force. Those are all things that are like proven practices that they're going to work over time. They're going to drive double-digit growth in CEB's business.","And it's going to have great margins, just like Gartner does. Getting from here to there, all I'm saying is, it's possible that it'll take like, as an example, maybe we'll have to \u2013 we'll train the CEB sales teams on certain aspects and we'll have to go back and re-train them again or something like that. So, to me there's no doubt that actually we'll get to a great place. But having not done it yet and having a lot of change simultaneously, we're certainly prudent in thinking that there could be some things that we have to \u2013 that we'll figure out, and by the way we do this all the time; we find problems, we go address them, fix it and get on with it.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And Anj, it's Craig. I think the way to think about the potential trajectory around wallet retention, they're really two primary drivers there. Number one is what you typically think about around retention, which is making sure the clients are getting consistent value over the life of the contract and renewing year after year after year after year, and again we have best practices around how to do that and we're already as we mentioned earlier rolling out portions or all of those best practices across the way we service the CEB Research clients. The other way we drive wallet retention at Gartner is by further penetrating existing buying centers and existing enterprises, and with an enterprise-type licensing model, that's difficult to do. And that's also one of the reasons why it's so important that we're shifting to seat-based because over the long-term that will allow us to actually further penetrate organizations as well and that will flow through into the wallet retention metric over time. Again that's not going to happen overnight, but if you think about those two levers are the way that we can get wallet retention looking and feeling like the Gartner wallet retention over time.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then for the second question, I was wondering if you can speak to sales force productivity x-L2, that's \u2013 it's really strong improvement year-over-year, so any further elaboration on which training programs are driving this. Is there any benefit from lapping some of the energy and utilities-related drag you guys had referenced last year. And perhaps any thoughts on how you see sales force productivity being reported as you integrate CEB? Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, the sales force productivity is being driven by the things you mentioned which is, we track the quality of \u2013 the three categories, broadly, probably as you know are recruiting, training and tools. We track the quality of people we're hiring and if we look at metrics like time to first sale, how much people sell in their first year, things like that, as well as the metrics when we're in the hiring process that are predictive, all those things tell us that we're actually hiring better people now than we were a year ago, and a year ago we were hiring better people than we were two years ago. And so the fact that we're hiring people that are a better fit with what we do is actually one of the things driving it. On top of that, we've continued to enhance our training program as we learn more about how to help new people become productive very quickly. We've enhanced training and focused on those things with training and coaching, and then as I mentioned, we have these quite advanced artificial intelligence-based tools that help sales people prioritize what they should be doing every single day. All three of those are actually working the way that we have designed them and expected them to work and that's the primary thing that is driving our improvement in sales productivity. Having said that, to your point, we are lapping some problems from last year in terms of certain segments weren't doing as well. But I can assure you that today's environment, not every segment is doing great. We have \u2013 we, what I characterize as normal environment is you have some things that are doing great, some things are doing okay and some things that you've got to work on. We're in that environment today and so the while studies show 80% of it is probably \u2013 just qualitatively 80% is kind of due to all the changes and then 20% is some of the industries that were in bad shape a year ago are not quite as bad now. Although there still some bad industries.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And the other I'd mentioned Anj and I think you know this from conversations with us over the years is there's no finish line for us in terms of productivity. We are pleased that we've seen some improvement. We're not done, we're going to keep trying to hire better people and improve that year-over-year-over-year and get them trained up better and improve the tools and improve the products and improve the research that impact retention as well. And so we're moving in the right direction and we're going to keep driving it. Because we know that ultimately improving our sales productivity will accelerate our contract value and research revenue growth.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. We have initiatives underway today in all four of those areas, recruiting, training, tools and retention to take the next leap over the \u2013 next year.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Super helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Please proceed.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. It's Henry Chien for Jeff. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you guys would be able to share any updated thoughts on in terms of the margin structure of the combined company, now that you've had a few months to integrate the company, whether it's a timeline or any potential synergies that you're seeing there or the more focus on growth and product development at this point.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning, Andrew (sic) [Henry]. It's Craig. On the margin side, if you think about from a business perspective, if you go segment-by-segment, our view is that the CEB Research products will run at roughly the same gross margin and incremental gross margin targets that we run the traditional Gartner business at.","So, think in the 70% range. I think same thing on the Events side. We haven't really changed the margin profile all that much, and again we're trying to drive significant growth in both of those businesses and so I'd expect margins maybe on research to improve a little bit as we're tracking a little bit behind the 70% over time, but essentially kind of tracking where we are. The one thing I would say though on the gross margin is as we continue to shift the mix, so as research continues to be our largest by far and fastest-growing segment, we do get some gross margin leverage from continuing to have a bigger and bigger piece of the \u2013 research being a bigger and bigger piece of the pie over time.","On SG&A, obviously on the G&A side, we're focused on harvesting cost synergies from the deal. And as Gene and I both mentioned, we are aggressively going after those. And some of them will be able to flow through in 2018; some of them will take a little bit longer just given timing of systems integrations and platform integrations and things like that. But on the sales side and given the size of the market opportunity, we expect to continue to invest in growing the CEB sales force to drive accelerated contract value growth on the traditional CEB business. And as we've seen on the traditional Gartner business, that is an investment upfront as first year productivity is low as we talked about earlier, second year productivity a little bit better, third year productivity starting to look like a fully tenured sales person. So, we're going to utilize the gross margin leverage we talked about earlier to continue to fund growth in both the Gartner sales force, again given the size of the market opportunity and the traditional CEB sales force to go capture that market opportunity over the long-term.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And just in terms of the timeline for the shift over to the seat-based pricing model and in general the release of the new product. So, I was wondering if you had a timeline there for the CEB side.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, it's Gene. So, basically in the areas that I mentioned, we've already introduced new seat-based products. And other than things \u2013 deals that were already in the pipeline, all new sales will be on those seat-based products. So you can think about \u2013 so new sales in the areas that I mentioned before, HR, finance et cetera are going to be seat based. Existing clients, we will let renew whatever the agreements they have, enterprise agreements, discounted, whatever it is, so long as they keep paying us, we're going to be keep taking their money, and so we'll keep renewing those. And so you think about it as \u2013 that there is two pieces of our business, the legacy business, where for happy clients that want to renew, we're going to keep letting them do that, we're happy to do that with them. That has great \u2013 that business has great margins and we're really happy with that, the clients are happy.","New products will be for new sales, could be to \u2013 and upgrades. So clients may choose to upgrade as well. But we're not going to force anybody to upgrade. And so we'll have \u2013 I expect we'll actually have some of the legacy products for a long period of time, just because some clients like that and will be happy with it, and we're not going to force them away. On the other hand, you can expect very quickly all the new sales will be on the seat-based products.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","The one other thing I'd add that is the \u2013 as Gene mentioned, the new seat-based products include the best of both, so in his example on HR, it's the great core CEB Research and deliverables and assets combined with the relevant Gartner technology. Research, that's really valuable to HR professionals. The legacy products won't have that, they'll be the legacy products. And so, as we continue to innovate and improve those seat-based products, I think over time, and this is what we saw on the Gartner journey from over a decade ago, clients will over time migrate over, upgrade over to the new products, because they're better. And they have more value and they'll get more value out of them. That said, we still have clients who are on legacy stuff. And again, as Gene mentioned, if they're happy and they want to keep renewing and keep paying us, we're happy to let them keep doing that.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","And I'll now turn the call over to Gene Hall for closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So to summarize the key points from today's call, first, the combination of CEB and Gartner creates a quantum leap in capability and sustained extraordinary growth over the long-term. We'll be able to address the mission critical priorities for every function across the enterprise, with leading insights and the best of both of the two organizations.","During Q2, the performance of traditional Gartner business continued to accelerate, CEB growth accelerated, retention strengthened and sales productivity improved at double-digit rates. In addition, the traditional CEB business saw modest improvements.","We developed a very aggressive integration plan and it's going great. We've already integrated our organizations, launched new products, introduced new commercial terms, accelerate sales force hiring, and set up the Talent Assessment as a standalone business and that's just in the first 120 days.","We're doing great as a combined company and our long-term outlook remains equally strong.

Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Shipman","","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. ","This call will include a discussion of Q2, 2014 financial results as disclosed in today's press release. After our prepared remarks you will have an opportunity to ask questions. I'd like to remind everyone that the press release is available on our website and that URL is gartner.com.","Before we begin we need to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward-looking statements.","With that I'd like to hand the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Gene?","Eugene A. Hall","","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 2014 earnings call. We had a very strong Q2, with robust performance across all of our businesses. The continued successful execution of our proven strategy drove another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, earnings per share and contract value.","Research is our largest and most profitable segment. And our Research contract value grew 13%, FX neutral continuing at an accelerated pace compared to 2013. As we have done consistently for the past two years we drove double-digit contract value growth in every region, every client size and in every industry segment.","We also achieved strong retention rates. The second quarter of 2014, enterprise client retention was at 84%, up from 2013, enterprise wallet retention was 105%, also up from Q2 2013.","In Consulting we drove terrific performance for the quarter, led by our Contract Optimization business. Consulting revenues increased 9% compared to Q1, 2013, and backlog was up 11%. Our Events business also delivered great performance with revenues up 39% compared to Q2 last year On a same-events basis, revenue growth was strong, with a revenue increase of 21%, year-over-year.","These results illustrate the sustained success of our strategy and the tremendous value we bring to our clients. As we discussed with your last quarter we are deploying our capital strategically. This year we repurchased more than 300 million of our shares and expect to spend a total of at least $400 million in 2014.","Looking forward our sales pipeline is robust with a solid backlog in our Consulting business and advance events bookings are strong. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about our future. ","The successful execution of our strategy drives our consistent performance. The fundamentals of our strategy are to create extraordinary research insight, develop strong sales capability to deliver high value differentiated offerings to provide world-class service and to continually improve our operational effectiveness. And we believe this strategy will allow us to sustain double-digit growth into the future. ","We are living in remarkable times. Technology is transforming the world and driving change in every industry and enterprise in the world in a scale seldom seen. IT is transforming how we work and what we do and Gartner is at the heart of it. ","Every company whether for-profit or not-for-profit, large, mini or small and any government agency in the world is a potential client, giving us a vast untapped market opportunity for our services. Gartner is the best source of help for enterprise leaders watching critical initiatives within this technology revolution. Our systems often make the difference between success and failure of our clients and were relevant for their institutions growing while facing economic challenges. ","I recently met with more than a 100 of our top sales leaders from around the world. They see the impact technology is having on our clients first hand. They've proud of the incredible insights generated by our analysts and inspired by the tremendous value we provide. We always had an incredible energized sales team but I never seen them so engaged and excited about our market position and opportunity as they are today. ","Outstanding operational execution is a core part of our growth strategy and it's our people who drive our execution. We put a lot of energy and investment into hiring the right people and developing great talents. As a result sales productivity of our new hires has been growing and our overall sales force turnover has improved for the third year in a year. And of course our sales associates are just as excited about Gartner as their leaders. ","And our focus on developing great people extends beyond sales. Earlier this year we launched a company-wide upward feedback survey that helped our managers become even more effective. Coincidentally the leading third-party company that administrated that survey found that Gartner ranked in the top 5% for associate engagement, among hundreds of companies in their database. So you can see the excitement about our market position and impact we have in our clients is pervasive throughout our company. ","In summary, I'd like to leave you three takeaways from today's call. First we consistent delivered double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EPS, EBITDA and cash flow. Second, the technology revolution is providing enormous future opportunities for Gartner. Finally, we believe that we have a strategy, the leadership team and the operational capabilities to take advantage of these opportunities and deliver sustained, attractive double-digit growth over the long term. ","I am extremely excited about the impact we have in clients and our growth prospects over the next several years. I'll now turn the call over to Craig Safian, who took over as CFO in June 3rd. Craig and I have been working together since my first day at Gartner and I am excited to continue working with him in this role. ","Craig Safian ","","Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. I am very excited to be here with you on my first earnings call since becoming Gartner's CFO two months ago. Over my 12 years at Gartner I\u2019ve worked very closely with Gene and the entire leadership team overseeing global finance, strategic and business planning and corporate development. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to be many of you and look forward to meeting all of you in the near future. ","Turning to today's call, during the second quarter Gartner continued its strong start to year with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue and earnings. Year-over-year contract value growth was 13%, consistent with our Q1 2014 performance and an acceleration from Q4 2013. And retention rate ended at or near all-time highs. Our Consulting business grew 8% on a FX-neutral basis for the second quarter on the strength of both our labor base consulting business and our contract optimization practice. And our Events business increased by 21% year-over-year on a same-events and FX-neutral basis. ","We saw robust demand for our services across all of our business segments in the second quarter. Our strong top line performance and effective execution in capitalizing on the operating leverage in our business allowed us to once again expand our gross contribution margin. Even as companies around the world face the uncertainties of the current macroeconomic environment, our business continues to grow at double-digit rates quarter-after-quarter, year after year. This is because our products and services provide great value to the IT, supply chain and marketing professionals we work with. We are engaged on their most important initiatives and projects. ","Our strong and improving retention metrics clearly demonstrate the value and importance of our products and services and we are finding new IT supply chain and marketing professionals to sell to everyday, in both our existing accounts and new prospect accounts as well. This is why we are confident that we will continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance over the long-term.","I'll now provide a review of our three business segments for the second quarter and will end with the details of our revised outlook for the remainder of 2014 before taking your questions. Starting with research. Research revenue was up 15% on an as-reported basis in the second quarter and grew 13% excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions. The contribution margin in this segment increased almost 70 basis points over the last year to 69%.","All of our key research business metrics remain strong. Contract value grew to a record level of $1.436 billion, a growth rate of 11% year-over-year on a reported basis and 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Our growth in contract value in Q2 was extremely broad-based with every region, every client size and every industry segment growing at double-digit rates. This has been the case for the past several years. ","We'll next cover retention rates in new business. As we discussed last quarter, historically we've reported our retention metrics at the organization level. Organization is our internally defined metric that identifies individual buying centers within the enterprises we sell to. We have found that the number of organizations can fluctuate due to both internal and external factors. This makes the metric less indicative of true business performance. Going forward we are reporting our retention metrics at the more indicative enterprise level.","Our client retention rate at the enterprise level ended the quarter at 84%, up a point versus last year and we've maintained client retention at the enterprise level of roughly 84% for the past two years. Wallet retention at the enterprise level ended at 105% in the second quarter, an uptick of one point from both the prior quarter and last year. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retain a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we have discussed in the past our retention metrics are reported on a four quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality. ","New business again increased year-over-year. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. Our contract value growth also continues to benefit from our disciplined of annual price increases and no discounting. We have increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year since 2005. We implemented a price increase during fourth quarter of 2013 and we expect to do so again this year during the fourth quarter. We also continue to see strong volume growth in our new business. This reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises.","As a result we ended the quarter with 9,115 client enterprises, up 7% over last year\u2019s second quarter. Additionally our average spend per enterprise continues to increase as well. To sum up we delivered another strong quarter in research. Our contract value growth accelerated from 2013 as we expected. We grew contract value by $162 million on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year. We continue to see strong demand from clients, our retention rates remain at or near all-time highs and we continue to expect acceleration in contract value and revenue growth over the long term. ","Turning now to events; for the quarter our event segment continued a four year trend of extremely strong year-over-year revenue growth. On a reported basis the move of four events out of the first quarter and into the second quarter affected the year-over-year comparison of our operating results. In the second quarter, events revenue increased 39% year-over-year on a reported basis and grew 38% on an FX-neutral basis. During the second quarter we held 28 events with 16,594 attendees compared to 25 events with 12,098 attendees in the second quarter of 2013.","On a same-events basis events revenue was up 21% year-over-year in the second quarter. For the first half events revenue was up 13% over the prior year from 36 events versus 37 events in the same period last year. The gross contribution margin for events was 50% for Q2, increased roughly three percentage points from the second quarter a year ago, again reflecting the move of four events out of the first quarter and into the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis we also improved gross contribution margin by approximately three points to 45%. ","Moving on to consulting, revenues in consulting increased 9% on a reported basis and grew 8% on a FX-neutral basis in the second quarter. Our contract optimization practice was the primary driver of the strength in consulting because, as occurred during the first quarter certain deals transacted earlier in the year than we had anticipated. Our labor-based consulting business was also solid, with 6% revenue growth in the second quarter. ","As we have discussed in the past our contract optimization practice has more variability than the other parts of our consulting business. We have seen a number of deals that we expected to occur in the second half of year to transact in the first half of the year. The business is performing very well and our expectations for the full year remain unchanged. We believe the first half upside was predominantly related to timing. The overall headcount of 505 was down 3% from second quarter of 2013. Second quarter utilization was 70% and revenue for per billable headcount ended the quarter at $454,000. ","We continue to see strong demand for our consulting services and our strategy of investing in managing partners is allowing us to capture that demand. We now have 87 managing partners, an increase of 7% from last year. Backlog the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our consulting business ended the quarter at $105 million. This represents an 11% growth year-over-year and a healthy four months of backlog, which is an appropriate level for this business. With the current backlog and visibility we have into the pipeline the consulting business is positioned to continue to deliver solid results in 2014.","Moving down the income statement, SG&A increased by $33 million year-over-year during the second quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force. As of June 30 we had 1,787 quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 238 or 15% from a year ago. We continue to tightly control G&A costs across the entire company. This expense item provides a source of operating leverage as G&A as a percent of revenue declined again in Q2.","Moving on to earnings, we delivered another quarter of solid earnings growth. Normalized EBITDA was $105 million in the second quarter, up 17% year-over-year and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.58, up 18% year-over-year. Our Q2, 2014 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes $0.06 in amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions. Excluding acquisition-related charges our normalized EPS grew 28% to $0.64 in the second quarter. ","Turning now to cash, first half operating cash flow increased by 9% to $153 million from the first half of 2013, largely due to higher earnings in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to 2013. We continue to expect to hit the full year guidance we set back in February for cash flow. ","During the second quarter we continued to utilize our cash to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase authorization. During the second quarter we repurchased over 1.5 million shares, and we used approximately $112 million of cash for share repurchases. As of June 30, we had $527 million remaining on our $800 million authorization.","We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position, despite the more aggressive pace of share repurchases and acquisitions this year. As of June 30, we had net debt of $57 million. We also deployed another $6 million in Q2, net of cash acquired on two very small acquisitions, Marketvisio and Senexx. ","Our credit facility runs through March 2018 and at this time provides us with about $366 million of remaining borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value. We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We also continue to believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital. Absent other significant opportunities to deploy cash we still expect to repurchase a total of at least $400 million of our own shares this year.","Turning now to guidance. We are maintaining guidance for most items from our previously issued guidance in May and our expectations are at the midpoint or modestly above the midpoint of our ranges. As you know our normal business trends do show seasonality. Our fourth quarter is typically our largest events quarter, a large consulting quarter and our largest contract value growth quarter. While we are generally at or modestly above where we targeted to be at this point of the year we still have our largest revenue and earnings quarter in front of us. ","We are making a modest change to our EPS guidance to account for three adjustments. First, GAAP EPS is impacted by our two additional acquisitions and their related charges. Second, we are now projecting lower equity compensation expense for the full year. And third, we are projecting a lower average share count for the year as well. ","Our EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges are impacted positively by the equity compensation and share count changes just mentioned. We now expect acquisition and integration charges of e approximately $29 to $30 million. We expect equity compensation expenses of between $36 million and $38 million and the share count of approximately 91 million shares for the full year of 2014.","Our normalized EPS guidance of $2.18 to $2.35 per share is $0.03 higher than the EPS guidance we gave you in May. Additionally we now expect GAAP EPS to be between $1.97 and $2.14 per share, a $0.01 improvement from our previous guidance, again reflecting the three adjustments just discussed. We still expect that on December 31, 2014 we will have fewer than 9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. All other items related to our guidance remain unchanged. For further information and details you can always consult our press release and most recent 10-Q. ","Based on what we see today we expect EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges to range between $0.37 and $0.39 per share for the seasonally light third quarter of 2014. Acquisition and integration charges are expected to be approximately $0.06 per share in Q3. The third quarter is historically one of our smaller revenue and earnings quarters. That will again be true in 2014. ","We are also planning three fewer events for Q3, 2014 than Q3 2013 which further impacts our projected results and a timing issue we already highlighted with respect to contract optimization will also further impact the seasonality of our third quarter results. ","So before taking your questions let me summarize. We delivered another strong quarter in Q2. Demand for our services is robust and as a result we generated double-digit revenue growth. Our key business metrics remain strong and in fact many improved in the second quarter. Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with the positive operating leverage inherent in our businesses, delivered solid earnings and cash flow growth for first six months of the year and we continue to actively explore strategic alternative for deploying our cash.","We will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisitions and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program going forward. Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in the second quarter of 2014 we remained well positioned to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth for the full year 2014.","Now I'll turn the call back to the operator and we will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Meuler from Baird. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Yeah, thank you. Could you maybe talk about the research contract margin that continues to drift higher, seems like it\u2019s approaching your targets? Any planned investments that we should be thinking about in that segment or maybe if you can just comment relative to your longer term targets?","Eugene A. Hall","","Hi, Jeff. Thanks, great question. As you have noted appropriately we are approaching that 70% incremental gross margin target that we have for research. We believe it\u2019s really important that we continue to invest in the right analysts, the right executive partners and other service delivery people, and that is reflected in that target of 70%. And so there is nothing new that I would discuss in terms of that 70% but we just believe to continue to maintain the right level of retention rates, the right level of client engagement and the right level of support for our growth. That 70% is still that appropriate target.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, and then just want to make sure, I didn\u2019t see it in the press release or hear it, is 13% to 14% constant currency contract value growth still what we should be thinking about for this year and Gene you\u2019ve I think closed out your comments by talking about sales force productivity of new hires continuing to improve, turnover continuing to improve and you guys have been, I think at 15% to 16% sales force growth in the last two quarters. Just wondering, one you would be hoping to kind of close the gap between the sales force growth and the contract vale growth.","Craig Safian","","Hey, Jeff. So as we said in the beginning of the year with our headcount growth and flat productivity to 2013 we expected our CV growth to accelerate from what we delivered in 2012, up into the 13% to 14% range. We still believe that is absolutely what is going to happen in 2014. In fact you have seen that in the first two quarters of the year we accelerated from the 12% we delivered in Q4 of 2013 up to 13% in both Q1 and Q2. ","Eugene A. Hall","And it\u2019s Gene on the second part of your question we expect, if our sales force headcount growth stays in the 15% to 20% range which is what we expect and our productivity is higher we expect we will start to see our CV growth accelerate over time.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Okay, and then just one final housekeeping one. The three fewer events in Q3 are those moved into Q4?","Eugene A. Hall","","So, as always Jeff we are constantly looking at our portfolio and moving stuff around based on the calendar, adding events, trimming events, moving events. So we are three lower in Q3 than what we did last year. Some of them moved into -- one of them moved into Q2, a couple of them moved out into Q4. We have added a few, we have trimmed a few. So it\u2019s our general trimming practice, our general portfolio management practice around the event portfolio.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co.","","Okay, thanks. Good quarter and Craig welcome to active participation in the calls.","Craig Safian","","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","","Okay, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. ","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray","","Thanks. So Craig if I have done this calculation correctly it looks like the normalized EBITDA margin is down just a fraction on a year-to-year basis. Is that just a function of mix with the consulting faster, is there anything you\u2019d call out?","Craig Safian","","No, I think, you have got it right, Peter. I think it\u2019s driven largely by mix. We have had stronger consulting performance then we have had in the past and the margins have been roughly flattish for the last several quarters so pretty consistent with that.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray","","Got it. And then as you\u2019ve gotten deeper into your new role how are you thinking about the prospects for margins over the next several years?","Craig Safian","","So as we have thought about it and looked at it the key to continuing to improve margins is improving sales productivity and getting contract value growth in the 14%, 15%,16% range and so as we continue to drive our productivity we do believe that margin expansion will follow that.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray","","Okay. And then the pace of buyback activity, obviously you\u2019re running above the $400 million level through the first-half of the year. Any thought in terms of acceleration of the $800 million program?","Craig Safian","","You know Peter as we talked about at the beginning of the year, when we put the $800 million program in place we would look to run through that in a two-year period which is about 2x the rate of what we have done previously. So we are still comfortable maintaining doing at least $400 million this year and that would leave another $400 million for next year. And so we are committed to running though the $800 million program over the next two years.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray","","Okay, so don\u2019t read anything into the fact that you did significantly more than you know a $100 million in the quarter in the first-half?","Craig Safian","","Think of it in the context of a two year program that we are going to run through.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray","","Got it. Okay, good. Thanks so much.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy McHugh from William Blair. Please proceed.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company","","Yes, thanks. I guess just on the contract value growth, I know you said it was fairly broad-based but I think the last you know six months-12 months the government channel has been a bit of drag for you guys. Have you seen a change there, has that turned around at all?","Eugene A. Hall","","Hey, Tim it\u2019s Gene. So there is a no change in the public sector globally and so it\u2019s exactly the same as it\u2019s has been for last 18 months or so.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company","","Okay, and then events, can you talk about what you have -- I guess what you are seeing or what you are doing then I guess is driving the strength. I know it\u2019s been a couple of years but is there anything different that you're doing this year, anything, any changes you made that's helping drive the growth. ","Eugene A. Hall","It's two things. First, the content developed by our analysts. We aim to have it better every year and it is particularly engaging to our clients and prospects and so we got great content. The second piece is that we have great operational execution with our events team. They're doing a just a tremendous job ranging from the event marketing, meaning marketing the content to prospects to actually great execution on-site. So it's a combination of both, terrific fundamental research by our analysts and great execution by our events teams is what\u2019s -- again we've see fabulous execution on these two fronts reflect in our events performance. We had great double-digit growth over the last three years or so and it's a modest acceleration but I think it's you can think about as being those two things.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company","Okay, and I'm sorry, the impact or the acquisition-related charges, what was the number you said do you expect now for the full year?","Craig Safian ","For the full year Tim, we're looking at $29 million to $30 million and that's a combination of the amortization of the acquisition intangibles, professional fees associated with doing each of those acquisitions and the ratable expensing of the hold back on the Software Advice transaction.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company","You mean the hold back, meaning the deferred revenue?","Craig Safian ","The deferred consideration.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thank you. A question on sales force productivity. Maybe if you could just update us on your numbers how Q2 looked like on a standalone basis and whether you believe your mix of net new business versus existing business accounting for about half, each of your growth whether that changes as you grow the sales force and productivity begins to improve, do you see that mix changing longer term. ","Eugene A. Hall","Good morning. How are you? On the sales force productivity, the way I\u2019d characterize it is if you look at both Q2 standalone, in Q2 standalone we are roughly flat to last year from a productivity perspective. If you look at the first half standalone we're actually up nicely compared to first half of last year and if you look at the rolling 12 quarter, rolling four quarter metric we\u2019re roughly flat to where we were when we ended the year last year. And so we're pretty pleased with where we are on a productivity perspective, particularly when looking at the first half performance compared to first half of last year.","In terms of your question on the mix, our belief when you look at that market opportunity is that it is enormous and it isn't both existing enterprises and enterprises that currently don't do business with us. And as we deploy our new sales people and create new sales territory we're going after both of those opportunities with gusto and with force. So I don't expect the mix to change significantly overtime because the opportunity is just so enormous in both pockets.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Got it, thank you. And just a follow up question on the balance sheet could you give us a sense of what you believe optimal leverage should look like on our balance sheet given double-digit growth in your business, most of the acquisition pipeline looking like a smaller to mid-sized deals and then given what you said on the buyback with $400 million annually. Could you help us understand how you think about leverage? Thank you.","Eugene A. Hall","Sure. In terms of leverage I mean you laid out the case for why we can take on leverage. We're growing well, great cash flow generation, predictable revenues free cash flow well in excess of net income. And so we have the profile where we can take on more leverage and obviously taking on two to three times leverage is not something that we would be too afraid about doing. It actually is fairly comfortable and given our cash flow profile we could, if needed to be pay that down relatively quickly. ","As we continue to look at the future in terms of capital deployment we are still focused on acquisitions as a great strategic way to deploy capital and quite in fact our acquisition pipeline is as robust as it's ever been since I have been at Gartner and we continue to look at lots of opportunities there, both small, medium and large size type acquisitions. And then additionally we believe we can continue to do that and also look at returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. ","So the net is, from an optimal leverage perspective, probably two to three times as optimal and again as we continue to look at the acquisition pipeline and acquisition opportunity market and a combination of share repurchases we move to that over time. For now we continue to look for acquisitions and we continue to return capital to shareholders.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","","Hi, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks and you talked about the new sales hires\u2019 productivity. Can you give us some color on what changes you have made there and any metrics associated with it, so that we can maybe track the progress there?","Eugene A. Hall","Hey it's Gene. So there is two changes we have made. First we have done a number of improvements to our recruiting process to make sure that we are identifying people that are mostly likely to be successful at Gartner and that's the first thing. So we are better hiring people that are really good fit and obviously they will do better, we\u2019ll have better sales productivity. ","The second thing we have done is we have completely revamped our training programs for our new sales hires. And those training programs also -- you have the right people and then you got great development and they are going to be successful. And those are the two pieces of it. As we look to kind of the forward-looking metrics like time to first sale and stuff like that we see that the people we have been hiring in to these new programs are doing measurably better than we have done in the past.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Okay and how should we think you mentioned that as you added new sales hires and they become more productive you expect the contract value to increase. How should we think about the pace of acceleration in contract value, just so we don't get ahead of our ourselves? Is there a formula that we can combine that with any other percentage of new sales hires to come up with, what might happen in any particular year?","Eugene A. Hall ","Yeah, Joseph the simple way and if you go back to what we showed at investor day I think that was the simplest way to kind of model it, which is looking at average productivity and the growth in the number of sales people. When we are growing at roughly call 15%, 16% per year on the sales force headcount growth and we are doing that consistently, the mix of new hires looks roughly the same year-over-year from a proportional perspective. ","And so I think the way to think about modeling CV growth is what's the pace of sales force capacity growth and then what is your assumption of average productivity and then the math should be relatively simple. But baked into that obviously it's more complicated than that, with new hires and new hire productivity but again proportionately we are roughly the same. So I was just trying to look at it from an average perspective.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Okay, that's helpful, and then the last one for me, can you just give us a quick lay of the land. Is anything tweaking up or down that is helping or hurting the business on the margin globally and I\u2019m thinking about Europe versus North America and you already talked about the public sector. I just want to get a sense if anything\u2019s really moving within the demand base that's affecting the numbers.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, it\u2019s Gene. I don't think there is material movement. The global economy different parts are marginally better or marginally worse. I think our demand has really been driven by what's going on in the technology world where technology have an accelerating impact on businesses and that's really what's driving it. If you look at across the world first is that the aggregate macroeconomic situation hasn't changed materially. But we do really well in some economies where the GDP is shrinking and it's because the companies and people sector institutions see how technology is affecting them.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Thank you.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Good morning guys. This is [Garner Hanson] in for Gary Bisbee. Just a quick question, with the acquisitions, how much did they contribute to research revenue and what impact did they have on gross margin?","Eugene A. Hall ","Sure, from a research revenue perspective for the quarter it was less than a two point impact on the growth rate related to Software Advice and the other two were immaterial on the quarter. And from a total revenue perspective it was around a one point impact on total revenue for the quarter and from an earnings perspective, roughly immaterial. ","Unidentified Analyst","","Great, okay. And then just going back to the contract optimization business, obviously had been strong in the first half. And you guys kind of narrowed that before but I mean, is it just the timing or was there anything else kind of driving the increased demand for the service?","Eugene A. Hall ","So it's a great business and we expect it to perform kind of at the rate annually that we built into our guidance there. As Craig mentioned some of the deals came in earlier in the year. So we expected a great year but some of them came earlier in the year than we expected. It\u2019s kind of as simple as that. ","Unidentified Analyst","","Fair enough. And then lastly, are you guys still guiding toward the low end of 15%, 20% sales headcount growth for the year?","Eugene A. Hall ","So as we said, our goal is to grow 15% to 20%. We were at 16% first quarter, 15% second quarter. So will probably be to the lower to middle point of the range for the full year. ","Unidentified Analyst","","Great, thanks so much. ","Operator","","Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. ","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs"," ","Hi. Good morning. I was just wondering if you can maybe give a little color on how your sales force is spread around the globe and maybe where you're adding faster, that's perfectly mirroring the contract value growth globally or are there particular areas that you are looking to add ahead of maybe some acceleration next year?","Eugene A. Hall","","Hey, Andre, it's Gene. So our sales force is -- if you look at between -- I don't have the exact numbers but you can think about it as Americas is little less than half. Europe is something like a third and the rest is in Asia. And we're kind growing it, there's pockets we are growing a little faster or little slower but all of them are growing at pretty good double-digit rates. So I wouldn't -- there is no kind of distinguishing factor there. Thing that really distinguishes more is in a more micro level where we think we\u2019ve got a manager, who is at a point of their career where they can handle faster growth or slower growth as opposed to it\u2019s based on the big geographies or something like that. It\u2019s really based on the tactics of where individual managers are in their career developments. ","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs ","Thanks. And a similar question, is there any particular level of seat that you're seeing more growth in the last quarter to, relative to say a few years ago for example, are the mid-level manager seats potentially growing faster than CIOs, wondering where your customers are seeing more demand for your service these days?","Eugene A. Hall ","As you may recall we have products from -- in the IT world everyone from a CIO all the way down in the line, we had those for a few years and the mix really is very consistent. So we're selling to CIOs. We're selling to the guy [inaudible] and we are selling to guys in front of them and then we are selling to the front line IT folks as well. And so there is no material change in the last few years in terms of that mix. ","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. ","Operator","","Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. ","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities ","","Good morning everyone. So, a question for you on the guidance, you beat consensus on the bottom line by $0.06 but you raised the full year guidance by $0.03. So based on what you said about $0.03 coming from the shift and the consulting side, should we think about the other $0.03 as coming from the core business, is that a fair way to look at that?","Craig Safian ","","Hey Bill. I think in terms of guidance, what we said in the prepared remarks, is it's pretty immature to really look at raising it significantly. So we're halfway through the year. As I mentioned we have -- fourth quarter is historically our largest quarter and where we sit today, everything looks pretty good as we discussed but we're still early in the year and not ready to raise anything. ","On the contract optimization side, as Gene discussed, it really is a timing thing and so we have the same expectation that we had entering the year for the revenues that will be generated by contract optimization. For the full year, we just have seen more transactions or transactions that we had expected in the second half of the year coming in the first half of the year and that's driving the timing there.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities","Got you. And then it's early but I wanted to ask how Software Advice is performing versus what your expectations were?","Eugene A. Hall ","It's Gene. Software Advice is a great business and it\u2019s performing so far according to our expectation. So it's been kind of right in line with what we expected, which is terrific.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities","And then one housekeeping question, you have been buying back a lot of shares so I just want to ask for fully diluted share count exiting Q2?","Craig Safian ","Sure thing, that would be 90.1 million shares.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities","Great, all right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Okay, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Herman from Stifel. Please proceed.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company ","Good morning everybody. Guys, just a question on the sales force growth. You had a sequential decline there. I know it's a very small decline but I am wondering if there is anything that you are seeing in the ability to higher folks given what appears to be a strengthening economy?","Eugene A. Hall","","It's Gene. So, I would take it as noise as opposed to anything meaningful. We have certain classes of, when we hire people, in some situation we hire classes of people and that can make for a little bit of swing from time to time. And so I wouldn't -- there is -- it's really noise. In terms of our ability to hire people actually, it's great. We are a place that professional sales people want to be at. It's a very hot -- we are [well in] company, hot area and we don't have any trouble finding people and as I mentioned despite the fact the economy is growing as you are saying and on the hiring, the job market is hotter. Our actual -- we our retaining of sales people is actually getting better. ","So our average retention of sales people is improving even in an environment where the job market is increasingly hot. So we don't have any trouble around hiring great sales people.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company ","Okay, And then Craig you mentioned the contribution from acquisitions in the quarter. Those numbers are probably pretty good representation for the full year, i.e. research about 2% and total about 1%, is that fair? ","Craig Safian ","Yeah, the only think I\u2019d caution a little bit is we\u2019ve only had -- we did not have Software Advice for the full first quarter. It was only on stream for about three weeks in Q1 and then a full Q2. Last quarter when we updated our guidance we did update it on the research side by about $20 million on the low and high end and that was done to account for having Software Advice for nine and two-third months of the year.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Okay, great and then just a follow-up question on the guidance. With regard to the third quarter you guys have sort of guided towards a down year-over-year comparison and I want to make sure, I understand that, that\u2019s predominantly relating to the timing in the events business?","Eugene A. Hall ","Yes, it's predominantly timing of events and also timing of contract optimization and so those two trends that we are seeing coupled with the fact that it is historically a very small quarter is causing that swing.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company","Great thanks guys, I will turn it over.","Operator","","Okay, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please proceed ","Ryan Leonard - Barclays","Hi good morning guys this is Ryan Leonard filling for Manav. Just wanted to hit on the contract optimization again, we obviously had another solid quarter but also the backlog is still up pretty solid. So I was just wondering if you could comment on kind of the relationship between the two and whether or not that kind of speaks to better a second half?","Eugene A. Hall ","That's a good question Ryan. So two things I\u2019ll tell you, one is that the contract optimization business, very little of it actually ends up in backlog. And so the transactions on contract optimization typically book and recognize revenue when those deals that we advise on are actually closed. The point on backlog though is underlying our labor base consulting business has performed pretty strongly. As I mentioned up 6% year-over-year in the second quarter and based on the backlog and based on the number of managing partners, and based on the pipeline, we believe that trend will roughly continue on the labor base business for the balance of the year. ","So we got some nice strength on labor base. Contract optimization as Gene mentioned is performing really, really well. We just saw more of the revenue and deals happen in the first half of the year.","Ryan Leonard - Barclays","Got it, perfect. And Craig, given your background in business development and some of your comments on a robust M&A pipeline. I was wondering if you had a commentary either kind of a change in M&A strategy or just a change in the overall market that makes you more open to deals or at least you're seeing more opportunity out there?","Craig Safian","No, so no change in the strategy, no change in the overall environment. I think just that as a company we\u2019ve got a much more honed approach to what we're looking at. And therefore we're looking at and seeing more things than we\u2019ve seen in the past and there are a lot more exciting opportunities out there than we seen in anytime on the past several years. ","Ryan Leonard - Barclays","Great, thanks. ","Operator","","Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Silber - BMO Capital Markets","","Thank you so much. And just looking at the number of consultants that seems to have been a trending down a little bit over the past year and a half. Is that because of move to the managing partner model there or is there something else going on?","Eugene A. Hall ","Hi Jeff, it's Gene. So I would take again as noise as opposed to -- there is no strategy for reduce the number of consultants or anything like that. Overtime as the demand for consulting shifts you have to shift the mix of people a little bit that it\u2019s just has to be with mix of specific skills. We are quite, as Craig said early we are quite optimistic about the business and did not aim to have fewer people, it\u2019s just kind of where we wound up with the change in mix we talked about. ","Craig Safian ","And Jeff, the good news there also is that the billable headcount actually includes the managing partners in it. So that's all-in number. And then the other thing I mentioned is, what it implies or actually more than implies is that those 505 people billable heads were much more productive than what we seen in the past as well. So we're driving utilization up as well. ","Jeffrey Silber - BMO Capital Markets","","Okay, that's great to hear. And then just a couple of quick number questions. In prior quarters you\u2019ve actually given us a number for the average [NCVI] per accounting. I was wondering if you get that again. And then you the guidance you gave for EPS is $0.37 to $0.39 this quarter. That was a GAAP number, is that correct?","Craig Safian ","No. I'll tackle the second one first. So the $0.37 to $0.39 is excluding acquisition integration charges number, and then we expect about $0.06 of acquisition integration charges in the quarter. ","On the productivity side, again what I\u2019d say is what I said mentioned earlier in the call during the Q&A, on a first half standalone we're up nicely year-over-year in terms of productivity. On a Q2 standalone we're roughly flat to last year on productivity and on a rolling four quarter basis we're roughly flat to where we were at the end of the year. ","Jeffrey Silber - BMO Capital Markets","","All right. Thanks so much. ","Operator","","Okay. Thank you. So, ladies and gentlemen that concludes your Q&A for today and I'd like to hand back to Brian Shipman for any closing remarks. Please proceed. ","Brian Shipman","","Thank you everyone for being with us on today's Q2 2014 earnings call. If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to contact us. We'll speak with you again on our 3Q conference call in early November. Have a great day. ","Operator","","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes your conference call for today.

With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond. This call will include a discussion of Q2 2013 financial results as disclosed in today's press release. After our prepared remarks, you will have the opportunity to ask questions.

Gene?","Eugene A. Hall","Good morning, and welcome to our earnings call for the second quarter of 2013. We had another quarter of double-digit growth as a result of the continued effective execution of our proven strategy. Research, our largest and most profitable segment, continues to deliver double-digit growth, with robust demand for our services across all regions, industries and client sizes. Our performance in the Americas, our largest geography, accelerated, with great results across the business. Europe was also strong, with double-digit growth despite a challenging economic environment. We also saw double-digit growth across nearly every industry, including the public sector. And finally, we saw double-digit growth across all client sizes, demonstrating the great demand for our offerings.","Our Events segment continues to exceed expectations in both attendees and exhibitors at our events around the world. And our Consulting segment had double-digit growth during the quarter, with strength across all regions we serve and in both Contract Optimization and core Consulting. We know how to be successful in any economic environment, and you're seeing that today in our results.","You've heard me say this before, these are remarkable times for technology. Technology is transforming the world. It affects how we work and what we do, and it impacts every industry. And Gartner is at the heart of it. Every institution in the world is a potential client, giving us a vast, untapped market opportunity for our services. Gartner is the best source of help for enterprise leaders launching critical initiatives within the technology revolution, and we are relevant whether an institution is growing or facing economic challenges. I remain confident and excited about Gartner. The Gartner brand is in a class by itself. Our products, services and people are superior to the competition, with a great business model, and relevant to virtually every company and every government agency in the world.","In summary, I'd like to leave you with 3 takeaways for today's call. First, we continue to see robust demand for our services. Our vast market opportunity and our consistent winning strategy allowed us to once again deliver double-digit contract value growth. Second, clients value our services whether they're growing or facing difficult budget cuts. And third, we continue to be well positioned to achieve sustained double-digit growth in our key metrics, as we've done over the past several years.","And with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Lafond","Thanks, Gene, and good morning, everyone. As Gene mentioned, we delivered a strong first half of 2013, reporting 13% growth in contract value and double-digit growth in each business segment for the second quarter. Our results demonstrate the continued successful execution of our strategy and our ability to consistently deliver on the financial objectives we have communicated over the past several years.","We continued to see strong trends in our key business metrics during the second quarter. Year-over-year contract value growth remains strong, and retention rates ended near all-time highs. Our Events business increased by 15% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis, and our Consulting business rebounded nicely, with 13% growth year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis.","Demand for our services remained strong across all 3 business segments. Even as companies face the uncertainties of the current macroeconomic environment, they turn to Gartner because we are a key partner for IT and supply chain professionals in running efficient and innovative programs to drive growth in their organizations. We are engaged on the most important projects for the institutions we work with. This is why, with the successful execution of our strategy, we continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance and why we are so confident that 2013 will be another year of double-digit growth.","Let me now review each of our 3 business segments for the second quarter. I'll finish today with a discussion of our revised guidance, and then we'll take your questions. Starting with Research. Second quarter Research revenue was up 12% to $311 million. Currency fluctuations had no material impact on Research revenues as compared to the prior year in the second quarter. Contribution margin in this segment increased 49 basis points to 69% in the second quarter, as our strong execution continues to capitalize on the operating leverage in this business.","All of our key Research business metrics remained strong in the second quarter. Contract value grew to a record level of $1.293 billion, a growth rate of 13% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. As has been the case for the past several years, our growth in contract value in Q2 was extremely broad-based, with every region and client size growing at double digits. As Gene mentioned, our largest region, the Americas, continues to perform very well and delivered a modest acceleration of contract value growth in Q2. And the rest of the world remained strong with double-digit contract value growth.","New business again increased year-over-year, continuing the trend we've seen since late 2009. The new business mix was balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. And while our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increasing and no discounting, approximately 80% of our contract value growth came from volume, with the balance coming from price increases. We've consistently increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year on an annual basis since 2005. We implemented a price increase during the fourth quarter of 2012, and we expect to do it again later this year.","Our volume growth reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients. As a result, we ended the quarter with 13,315 client organizations, up 7% over last year's second quarter. Our client retention rate ended the quarter at 82%, and we've maintained client retention rates between 82% and 83% for 12 straight quarters.","In addition to retaining our Research clients at an impressive rate, the clients we retained continue to increase their spend with Gartner, and wallet retention ended at 97% in the second quarter. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we have discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a 4-quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in our Research segment. We grew our contract value by $145 million on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year. We continue to see high levels of demand from clients, and we expect acceleration in contract value and revenue growth. We remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit annual revenue growth in this business over the long term.","Turning now to Events. Our Events segment continued the trend of extremely strong year-over-year revenue growth we've delivered for the past 3 years. In the second quarter, Events revenue increased 15% year-over-year on a reported basis. Currency fluctuations had no material impact on Events revenue. During the second quarter, we held 25 events with 12,098 attendees compared to 21 events with 12,540 attendees in the second quarter of 2012. On the same-events basis, attendee revenue was up 12% and exhibitor revenue was up 15% year-over-year. As we expected and discussed on our last earnings call, the gross contribution margin of 47% for Q2 rebounded from the seasonably-light first quarter of the year.","Looking ahead, we see strong demand for both attendee and exhibitor participation at our upcoming events. And for the full year, we expect this business to continue the trend of strong growth in revenue, contribution margin and margin expansion we have seen over the past few years.","Moving now onto Consulting. We told you last quarter that Consulting would improve as the year progressed, and our second quarter results reflect that. Revenues in Consulting grew 12% on a reported basis in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenues grew 13%. Billable headcount of 518 was up 8% from the second quarter of 2012. Second quarter utilization was 68%, up slightly from the prior year. Revenue per billable headcount ended the quarter at $428,000 per billable headcount.","Most important for the remainder of the year, we are seeing good and steady demand for our Consulting services. Backlog, the leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $94 million. This represents 1% growth year-over-year and a healthy 4 months of backlog. Additionally, our pipeline is solid as we enter the second half of the year. With the current backlog and visibility we have in the pipeline, the Consulting business is positioned to deliver results in line with our long-term objectives.","Moving down the income statement. SG&A increased by $20 million year-over-year during the second quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force. As of June 30, we have 1,549 quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 191 sales associates from a year ago. We continue to tightly control G&A costs across the entire company. We believe this expense item will provide us with a source of operating leverage in the future as G&A will continue to decline as a percent of revenue.","Moving on to earnings. We delivered another solid quarter of earnings growth, with normalized EBITDA of $90 million in the second quarter, up 14% year-over-year, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, up 14% year-over-year. As expected, our Q2 2013 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes $0.01 of amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions, including Ideas International. Our earnings results were also impacted by a higher-than-projected tax rate. The effective tax rate of 35% in Q2 was driven by a modest shift in mix of our earnings to higher-tax jurisdictions.","Turning to cash. Operating cash flow increased by 41% to $140 million in the second quarter of the year. In Q2, we experienced early collections than the same quarter a year ago. We continue to expect the same level of free cash flow for the full year, that we have indicated in our previously issued guidance. Over the long term, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow substantially greater than our net income, given our tight cash management and the negative working capital characteristics of our Research business.","During the second quarter, we utilized our cash to return capital to shareholders for our share repurchase program. We repurchased over 850,000 shares at a total cost of approximately $49 million. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position, with net cash of $128 million.","Our credit facility runs through March of 2018 and at this time, provides us with about $550 million of remaining borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value. And we continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital, and we have $143 million remaining under our board authorization.","Now let me turn to our business outlook for the remainder of 2013. With a strong start to the year, we're well positioned for double-digit full year revenue, earnings and cash flow growth that we expected as we began the year. However, currency fluctuations have moved enough in the first half of the year to require a slight change to our guidance at this point in the year. The details of our guidance are included in the earnings release issued this morning. Let me take a minute to highlight some of the changes.","As with our guidance at the beginning of the year, we've made no attempt to anticipate future changes in foreign exchange rates. This revised guidance is based on where rates are today. And as a result, we're reducing both the low end and high end of our previously issued total revenue guidance by $15 million, with the changes due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar since issuing our guidance back in February. We now expect total revenues of between $1.76 billion and $1.805 billion, a change of less than 1%. This change to revenue guidance in both Research and Consulting segments are solely related to FX. In the Events segment, stronger expected performance was offset slightly by FX, resulting in the increase in guidance for that segment. From a seasonality perspective, I would remind you that the fourth quarter is the largest quarter of the year for the Events business and will make up more than 50% of the full year revenues in that segment.","With respect to earnings guidance, we modestly reduced the bottom and top end of our previous EBITDA guidance range by $5 million to account for currency fluctuations, again representing a change of 1%. We also lowered our EPS guidance, driven again by these FX changes, as well as a higher tax rate assumption. We're revising our tax guidance upwards to approximately 32.5% from approximately 31% due to a shift in the projected mix of earnings to higher-tax jurisdictions for 2013, consistent with our comments about the Research growth rates geographically. There were no other changes to our previously issued guidance.","And so to summarize, we delivered strong results in the second quarter across all 3 business units. Demand for our services is strong, and as a result, we generated double-digit revenue growth and our key business metrics remained solid in the second quarter. Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with the positive operating leverage inherent in our businesses, delivered double-digit earnings growth, and we generated substantial cash flow.","As always, we're actively exploring strategic alternatives for deploying our cash. We'll continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we expect to repurchase shares throughout the remainder of 2013. Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in the second quarter, we've built a solid foundation for delivering strong revenue and earnings growth in 2013. We're well positioned for double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing returns to our shareholders over the long term.","Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Gene, you cited better results in the U.S., and you sounded fairly upbeat in terms of strength in Research across the board. But the CV growth and the revenue growth did decelerate, at least a little bit on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So what was driving that?","Eugene A. Hall","Peter, it's Gene. So as I said on the call earlier today, we're performing pretty well globally, with every region, every client size and almost every industry vertical growing at double-digit rates, including, by the way, the public sector. And our Americas grew a little faster than average, and the rest of the world grew modestly lower than average. And what's going on under the covers is, there's a few pockets within Europe that posed some challenges for us. And so Europe growth was a little slower than overall average, and it's in pockets of Europe. So again, much of Europe is very strong, but there are a few pockets that were a little -- not quite as strong. Again, just to reinforce, despite that, we still had double-digit growth in Europe, so we'd characterize it to be pretty strong still.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, Chris, in his comments, I think that the quote was something like expect acceleration in CV and revenue growth. Can -- Chris, can you be more specific on that?","Christopher J. Lafond","Peter, thanks. As we continue to see where we are, and with Gene's comments he just made, if you look at our performance -- and as you know, what we've been doing over time is continuing to implement initiatives across the company to improve our performance. And I think what you're seeing in the U.S., with the slight acceleration, is that those things are taking hold so we feel really good about what we're seeing in the U.S. As Gene mentioned, we're still seeing really good performance even in challenging places like Europe and public sector. So we think those things are having impact, and as things return to more normal levels, we'll see things accelerate. So whether that's later this year or into next year is the question, but we feel very good about what we're seeing as we look at the details of our performance.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just last thing for me the -- Gene, you've talked for a couple of quarters about focus on sales force productivity. Can you give us an update in terms of how the initiatives are progressing? It looks like the productivity is still down a bit on a year-to-year basis.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, Peter. So we have a number of initiatives to continue to grow our sales productivity. In fact, let's -- I should start with our sales productivity, actually, we're very happy with it. We think it's quite good. And we have -- but we do have a number of initiatives that we think, over time, will take that level to an even higher amount. And as Chris mentioned, we've implemented -- the way we generally roll these things out is we start in the Americas, and then we roll them out through the rest of the world over time. And we've implemented some of the latest ones in the Americas. And as we mentioned there, we saw an uptick in performance there, which increases the productivity there. As I mentioned, there are some other parts of the world, particularly in Europe, where we had some pockets that weren't quite as strong, and that's what's impacting the overall sales productivity.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Actually, I'm sorry, just one more thing. On the tax rate, Chris, the -- any further color? It's all just basically mix? And is there anything about the expiration of the R&D tax credit next year that we should be thinking about?","Christopher J. Lafond","No. I think, this quarter, it's all due to mix. As I talked about, we had originally projected 31% for the year. We're now expecting about 32.5%. And so what you saw on the quarter was a bit of a catch-up for the year, which is why it was a bit higher for the quarter. We don't expect it to be at that level for the remainder of the year. We expect the whole year to end at about 32.5% and again, consistent with the comments we just made on where our performance is. It's driven -- seeing some more income in the U.S., which is higher-tax jurisdiction, so it's really all driven by that.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And what's your view on the R&D tax credit?","Christopher J. Lafond","If you look forward -- at this point, Peter, we're not expecting any dramatic change to our longer-term tax rates. We've said that, that rate should be in the 31%, 32% range. We still are looking at that. Obviously, there's a lot of things changing in the world of tax right now, and so as we continue to monitor that, we'll be able to give you more color. But as of this point, we don't see anything that should change that over the longer term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I want to ask a follow up to the answer you gave to one of Peter's questions. But in terms of the reacceleration, I think you said whether it be later this year or next year -- I mean, it seems like you're not baking a reacceleration into your guidance. But are you seeing any signs, whether it be in your business or whether it just be some of the European macro data points stabilizing, that suggests this reacceleration? Or is it just your confidence in your strategy and the things that you've been doing that lead you to believe that it will happen?","Eugene A. Hall","Jeff, it's Gene. So the -- as we've talked about it, we don't try to forecast any improvement or deterioration in the economic environment. So when we talk about our thoughts on what's going on, it's assuming the economic environment doesn't get better and doesn't get worse. And so -- and then on top of that, frankly, we think we can do pretty well whether the economic environment is challenging or whether it's robust. And so the improvements we're talking about are more operational changes. And in fact, frankly, as I talked about some pockets of weakness, it's operational, it's not due to the economics. If you tried to correlate it with the GDP growth or unemployment or something like that, it's more correlated to where we have operational work to do as opposed to that it's the macro environment.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. But are you seeing signs of improvement already that give you the confidence? Or is it just that you have confidence in the model and know that where there are pockets of weakness, you can or are making operational changes and eventually, that will yield reacceleration?","Christopher J. Lafond","Jeff, it's Chris. So a couple of things that I would say. As we talked about, in the Americas, we did see an acceleration. So we certainly have factual data points in the Americas that things did accelerate a bit, so we did see that. And so from our perspective, we're seeing them. We look across our business in great detail and we can see places where things are improving. And -- but at the end of the day, as Gene said, we do believe that our own execution will continue to allow us to improve and accelerate over time.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just maybe a comment on wallet retention. You guys kind of framed retention as being kind of in this record range that it's been in, in the last 2.5, 3 years. But wallet retention did tick down year-over-year by 2 full points, which seems somewhat meaningful. So can you just kind of break out what's going on there between up-sell and kind of retention of different size clients and then, I guess, why you have the confidence that this is just kind of normal variability in that range instead of a trend that's worth closer monitoring?","Christopher J. Lafond","So a couple of things on retention that I would mention. First, we've been very consistently retaining our clients. So our client retention has been 82%, 83% now for 12 quarters, and so that is a very consistent trend, where we retain all of our clients and retain them at the same rate that we have been for quite some time. When you look at the wallet retention rate, it's very consistent with the comments I think we made during our talk here, in that we're seeing some continued good retention rates in Americas. Some of the slowdown and a little bit of the deceleration you've seen in Europe that's driving the CV growth is driven by a little bit of the retention. So where you're seeing it is in those pockets that Gene talked about, as opposed to broad-based. When we look at our retention rates globally and look at it in great detail, we feel very confident. We're seeing really good retention rates across the vast majority of the business, and it's just a few pockets of places that are causing that, consistent with the CV going from 14% to 13%.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one for me. Can you guys just hit on which currencies we should be thinking about having the greatest impact on the guidance adjustment? Is it the yen, the Canadian dollar, et cetera?","Christopher J. Lafond","Well, our biggest currencies other than the U.S. dollar are the euro and the pound. Those are, by far, the 2 biggest. And so as those move, that's where you're going to see the biggest impact. Certainly, if you work your way down, you have the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen. Those are really the top 5 currencies that have an impact, but the 2 are the ones that really move the needle the most.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","But I'm asking from the standpoint of weren't the euro and pound rates against the dollar more stable year-to-date than some of these other currencies? So I'm just wondering what drove the adjustment in terms of the moves given that it seems like the euro and pound exchange rates are more stable.","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes, and that's why we only moved them by 1%, right? So there was enough of a move that we felt it was material enough to update our guidance for the foreign exchange move, but it hasn't been significant, which is why we only moved it 1%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I was wondering if you can just elaborate, in the U.S., what you feel like you're having the most success with in terms of just kind of the operating strategies to drive the slight acceleration. I know you're always doing a couple of things, but if there's any specific strategies that are helping to drive productivity up a little.","Eugene A. Hall","Tim, it's Gene. So it's a continuation of the things we've been doing over time. So it starts with things like productivity initiatives in the sales force, which are things like improving our training. It's also things like the tools that we give our salespeople. We also have introduced -- every quarter, we introduce a set of product enhancements, and so there's been a continuous sort of product enhancements. And as I mentioned, we tend to roll those things out in the U.S. first -- in the Americas first and then, through the rest of the world, the different regions. And so that's kind of where you see the first impact of these things. That gives you a flavor for it. It's things like sales tools and training and product enhancements.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, what's your thought process on sales force expansion as we go through the year? You added a decent amount and the year-over-year growth rate picked up a little. Would you expect that to continue to pick up? Or do the pockets of weakness in Europe, I guess, give you pause from accelerating that too much?","Eugene A. Hall","So as you know, our long-term objective is to grow sales rate at 15% to 20% a year. And earlier this year we said, this year, we're planning to grow at approximately 15%, and we're still planning to grow at approximately 15%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wonder if we could go back to Consulting. I mean, you guys put up a -- what looks like a pretty decent quarter in that business. Can you talk about the momentum there? And I know you gave a backlog number, but just maybe more of the feel of what we can expect from that business going forward.","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. So in the Consulting business, we had some deals slide between -- from Q1 to Q2, and so it gave us a stronger Q2 than kind of -- so if you look at the 2 -- you have to look at the 2 quarters kind of together, and I think that's indicative of what you'd expect to see on a go-forward basis. So we're seeing good strength in Consulting across all of the geographies that we serve and in the 2 majors segments, core and CFC. So we're seeing good strength there. But again, I do think we had some deals that slid between quarters. So if you look at the first half, I think that's a good way to think about the Consulting business.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess kind of given the lumpiness that's taken place in that business over like, let's say, the last 12 to 18 months, do you feel like you've hit a more normalized run rate?","Christopher J. Lafond","Joe, it's Chris. I think there's a couple of things. As we talk about all the time, the CFC business can be quite lumpy depending on when our clients choose to do some of these larger engagements. And so what we've said over time is that, that business tends to be a little less predictable quarter-over-quarter, and so you can see some shifts in the quarterly results as a result of that -- Contract Optimization. Sorry, I used an internal acronym. It's Contract Optimization. It's the business that tends to be a bit lumpy. I think what you saw in the quarter, as Gene mentioned, is a really nice balanced performance. You saw the CF -- Contract Optimization business improve. You saw, as Gene said, our core and benchmark business was also delivering some nice results. And so as Gene said, I think when you look at the half, you can see kind of we're right where we wanted to be as we started the year in terms of our overall expectations for the business. I can't sit here today and say that every quarter is going to be perfectly smooth because the business is, as you know, tends to be a little less even as our Research business, which is a subscription model, we recognize revenue evenly over the course of those contracts. That's not the same model as Consulting. So we feel very good about the results, very good about where we are today. As you know, we've done a lot of things in that business to get to the kind of results we're at, and we expect to continue to deliver against our longer-term expectations over time.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. In Europe, could you talk about any changes to your approach there? In other words, around the sales front or -- and\/or pricing or deal size, any changes in your approach given sort of the weakness that we've had in that particular region?","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. So the same approach is pretty much we use in Europe as we use elsewhere, with one exception, which is there's -- because of the economic environment, it's very challenging in Europe in many -- for many companies and many government institutions, there's offerings in our product line that are more focused on helping people save costs. And so we emphasize the cost reduction part of our offering more there than we would in companies and institutions that have a lot of growth. It's not that we don't do it elsewhere, but it's just more of an emphasis.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then the last one for me, you talked about maybe an acceleration kind of in the business, as we head towards the back half of the year. Is that because we're returning to a normal state? Or do you feel like demand's improved in particular regions and that carries it? I just want to get a feel for sort of that -- where that acceleration is coming from.","Christopher J. Lafond","Just let me make sure we're clear on the comment I made. So what I said when we were talking about the Research business is that, over time, we certainly expect acceleration. And what we also said was we weren't necessarily saying it's going to come in the third quarter, fourth quarter et cetera. What we really are saying there is that given the performance we're seeing, seeing the acceleration in the U.S., feeling good about the programs and things we've put in place, feeling good as we look in detail across the business at much deeper levels, various regions and certain managers around the world, we're seeing great performance and great results. And we certainly expect that, that will continue to make its way through the rest of the world, as things start to stabilize in Europe and some of the other pockets of weakness that we see. So we certainly expect it for all those reasons, and I wouldn't sit here and tell you today that we've forecasted you're going to see that acceleration in either Q3 or Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Bird with Lazard Capital.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I'm just wondering if you could give us your current philosophy on buybacks and potentially, getting leverage for buybacks? And separately, for Events, could you talk about just what you're seeing in advanced bookings for exhibitors and attendees?","Christopher J. Lafond","Great. Thanks, Bill. In terms of buybacks, as those of you who followed us for a long time know, we've been pretty aggressive in terms of using our cash whether that's acquisition, where we find them and they make sense, which we will continue to do, and absent those, continue to be aggressive in share repurchase. And we spent about $100 million to date, and you should expect us to continue to be there. So our strategy remains the same. We think it's a great use of cash. We're going to continue to be aggressive in the marketplace, and we'll continue to be buying shares back for the remainder of this year and into the future. We still have $143 million on our share authorization program and so have plenty of capacity. And we also, right now, are not very heavily levered on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. We certainly have no issues with taking our leverage higher for the right transactions, whether that is more aggressive share repurchase or the right acquisition. We certainly have been much higher over time and have no concerns or issues with taking our leverage higher at all. So that's kind of the comments on your first question. On the second question around Events, our advanced bookings and indications for our events in the back half of the year, particularly symposium, look really strong, as strong or stronger than we saw in previous years at this same period of time prior to the events. So we feel really good about what we're seeing right now in the pipeline and what's already been booked for those events.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And Chris, on leverage, is there a certain, I guess, limit that you have in mind that the company just philosophically wouldn't cross?","Christopher J. Lafond","We have no problem being in the 3x to 4x debt-to-EBITDA range for the right transactions because we could take it down very quickly with our cash-generating ability. Could you go higher than that if the transaction was right? Sure. We'd absolutely look at that. So we are very comfortable with our financial model, very comfortable with the cash we generate. And so taking that level up for a short period of time and bringing it back down pretty quickly for the right transaction is no source of a concern for us at all.","William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And just one final question. On Research, the lower guidance, is it due only to FX?","Christopher J. Lafond","In the 3 segments, Research and Consulting are solely due to foreign exchange, no other reason for the change. And on the Events business, we actually increased it because our performance has been so strong, and it was offset slightly by lower FX. So really Events was the only one that was changed for performance reasons, and that was changed to the upside.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Herman with Stifel.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I do have a follow-up to the currency question. You've been helpful with regard to how it impacted the top line. Could you give some color in terms of how it's impacting the bottom line for the year outlook?","Christopher J. Lafond","Sure. What we've said over time and continues to be the case is we're fairly naturally hedged. So we have -- with revenues in -- around the world, particularly in those major currencies I mentioned earlier, we also have costs, analysts, salespeople in those regions. As we get bigger and bigger, the natural hedge is not 100%, and so as you see a little bit of movement on the top line, it does start to filter as we have larger EBITDA now over time. And so that's why you're seeing the slight change to the EBITDA side. So while we saw the 1% reduction on the top line, it's about 1% on the EBITDA line or about $5 million. And that's why it's relatively minimal to the earnings line.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe some additional color on sales force. And realizing that you have targets there, but can you talk, sort of below the raw numbers, what you're seeing with regard to recruiting, attrition and sort of the tenure? Is there a drift in tenure in either direction?","Eugene A. Hall","Its Gene. So in terms of our sales force, I'd say there's no important changes in any of the 3 things you mentioned. So in terms of recruiting, we're seeing lots of interest to work for Gartner. The technology sector is a very exciting sector to be in and we have a great a brand name, so attracting salespeople to Gartner has always been a very -- we're an attractive place to work for salespeople, and that continues to be that way. Our attrition is right in the range where it has been historically and where we expect it to be, so no change there either.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And a question about Events. Maybe you can help us with the dynamics in the quarter and the outlook. The raw number of attendees was actually down, and the revenue was up a lot. Help us with regard to either pricing or mix in that business, both for the quarter and on a go-forward basis.","Christopher J. Lafond","Great. So just a couple of things on price. Actually, our average price is actually up nicely year-over-year. We do increase prices in Events, as we do with Research and every part of our portfolio in fact. And so the average price -- and again, when you look at average prices, it's also depending on the event, so as the mix moves, certain events have higher price points than other price points. But overall, if you try to normalize that, the average price per attendees is actually up, which is great. There are -- when you look at the attendee mix, there are some mix of attendees that pay different price points, and the mix has been -- has shifted to where we want it to be in terms of the attendees. And so we're very comfortable with what we're seeing on the attendee side at all of the events that we've had in the first half and continue to see really nice demand at this point for the events we're holding in the second half. So that's kind of where we are on the Events business.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And final question for me, just with regard to cash redeployment. You referenced potential for deals, can you talk about pipeline or activity targets there relative to the past?","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. So obviously, we're not going to comment on any specific companies. We do track a number of companies. Today, we're probably tracking in the order of 100 companies. That's been true every quarter for the last 5 or 6 years, and so we have a number of companies we think are interesting that we track. And where it's appropriate, we maintain relationships with those companies. And if the right strategic situation comes up, the right price, as has happened several times in the past, we'll do an acquisition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Over the past quarter or so, we've been hearing a lot of cautious comments from a lot of technology companies, and even your own company lowered your forecast for IT spending in the back half of the year. I'm just curious how you can reconcile that with the bullish comments that you're saying in your business.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. So our business is not -- it's Gene. Our business is not driven by technology spending. It's driven by companies having initiatives in their business, and so the -- it's not really driven by technology spending at all. And so we're not sort of correlated with that. And another way to think about it is there's like $3 trillion of technology spending, and if that goes up or down a little bit, it just doesn't affect -- people are still buying trillions of dollars worth of equipment and services. And so whether that's $2.9 trillion or $3.1 trillion, they're still buying a lot of stuff, which is why whether it goes up 5% or 10% doesn't matter to us. It does to some of the technology providers, it's much more important.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. On a couple of the retention metrics in the Research segment, can you remind us -- is there any seasonality in those metrics?","Christopher J. Lafond","We always report our metrics on a 4-quarter rolling basis to avoid that. So there are -- there tend to be a little bit of a seasonality at certain points in time, and so the reason that we don't report an individual quarter's retention is to normalize for that seasonality.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then also, Gene in your comment, you talked, to some extent, about Europe. Mostly it was good, but there were some countries that are a little bit weaker. I'm just curious if you could tell us, generally, which countries those were and what's going on there and how the focus to improve that is going.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, so we're not going to break that out, but it wasn't even necessarily the country level, meaning we saw pockets that didn't -- you shouldn't interpret that as even a whole country necessarily. So again, we had -- if you look at our individual sales teams, we had teams -- in general, the teams did very well. And we had a few pockets where, again, we have operational improvements to make.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So it's, again, more internal issues as opposed to external?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. Again, I would say that it is definitely internal. Because again, if you looked at our performance versus GDP growth in those countries, we didn't have the best performance in the countries with the best GDP growth or the worst in the countries with the worst GDP growth. Again, it depends on the operational performance of the individual teams.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question on the Events side, I mean, clearly, you guys continue to do well there year-over-year, and you continue to increase the number of events. Long-term -- I guess, 2 parts. First, in the medium term, are there any particular themes or certain specific niche events that are driving sort of the growth there? And then longer term, I guess, is it just a game time decision year-over-year or is there a focus or a long-term plan to increase those 4, 5 events every year?","Eugene A. Hall","So it's Gene. So there's no kind of niche events that are driving our Events business. It's very broad. If you look at it, we're getting great growth across all our geographies and across the vast majority of our events. Again, I would characterize it as being very strong and very broad-based in terms of the performance. It's not driven by any kind of niche thing or anything like that. And then, long term, again, we intend to keep the same strategy at Events, which is we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow our existing portfolio of events, and we'll continue to do that. And then we intend to keep launching new events over time as well. Again, very consistent with what we've done in the past.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow-up on the M&A pipeline. You talked about 100 interesting companies. Maybe you could just help us understand -- like, clearly, there's a lot and you said they were all interesting. So what's the sort of hold-back? Is it you guys being very price conscious? Is it them asking for way too much? Or what's the dynamics there in terms of why one of these 100, over the last couple of years, haven't sort of been more than just an interest?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, it's -- I'd say it's 2 things. Pricing is certainly a factor because we want to make sure we pay the right price for any kind of acquisition we make. The second thing is -- has to do with the owners and the management team. If it's a private company, if the owners don't want to sell, then obviously we can't buy it. And similarly, if it's -- even if it's a public company, we have to make sure that the management team is going to be helpful in an acquisition. And that's part of why we often maintain relationships in advance, so that people kind of understand how great being a part of Gartner could be.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one. Share count assumed in the guidance, just some housekeeping here.","Christopher J. Lafond","From a share count -- no change to the original guidance, roughly $95-ish million for the year -- sorry, 95 million shares for the year, sorry about that, not dollars.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Brian Shipman for any closing remarks.","Brian Shipman","Thank you, Erica, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to updating you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. Everyone, may now disconnect, and have a great day."],"10167":["Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) Q3 2017 Earnings Call November  2, 2017  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Craig W.

LLC","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Gartner's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. This call will include a discussion of Q3 2017 financial results as well as an updated outlook for 2017. After prepared remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions.","In addition to today's press release, the company has provided an accompanying presentation as a reference point for investors and analysts. Both the press release and the presentation are available on the investor website at investor.gartner.com.","Certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. The company encourages all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.","With that, I would like to hand over the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Mr. Hall, you can please proceed.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning and welcome to our quarterly earnings call. Thanks for joining us. We delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth in Q3 of 2017. Our business continues to perform well. We're making great progress on the integration of Gartner and CEB. And I continue to be excited about our business, our prospects for growth and our strategy to drive value for our shareholders over the long term.","We're living in exciting times. Technology is opening up new markets and creating innovative ways to serve customers. Technology-driven disruption is providing exponential growth opportunities and threats to entire industries. Cybersecurity is a pervasive and critical risk. Technology is also becoming a critical factor in every function of the enterprise, supply chain; sales; marketing; HR; finance; legal; and the rest. And if that's not enough, the business environment continues to be mixed, exchange rates; commodity prices; global macroeconomic growth; and geopolitical dislocations.","Business leaders have never faced the rate of change they face today. They need help to deal with these difficult issues. The combination of CEB and Gartner gives us unique capabilities to help clients address these issues with every function of the business. We're providing the best of both businesses, research methodologies, sales and service best practices, operations and together, we will be better than either company was alone. So, the combination of Gartner plus CEB will provide a quantum leap in our ability to help clients.","In a moment, Craig will take you through the details of our Q3 results, but before he does, I'd like to take you through a few performance highlights. Now, as we've done our previous earnings calls and because of ongoing exchange rate volatility, I'll review these highlights in FX-neutral terms.","The traditional Gartner business continues to deliver outstanding performance. For the third quarter of 2017, traditional Gartner revenues grew 14% year-over-year. The traditional Gartner Research business is doing great. In Q3, we delivered 16% revenue growth and 15% contract value growth with double-digit increases in every region across every size company and in virtually every industry. And we achieved these strong results despite a two-week disruption in one of our major hubs due to Hurricane Irma and also a higher-than-usual level of M&A in our clients.","Our sales force continues to be our largest investment. At the end of Q3, the traditional Gartner sales force grew 17% year-over-year. Sales force growth accelerated as we identified and hired a large number of highly qualified sales people, allowing us to reduce our number of open sales territories to near record low levels. This provides a great foundation for future growth.","As I mentioned in our last call, improving sales productivity remains a top priority for us. Over the past few years, we've implemented a number of programs to improve sales productivity and those actions are working. We drove another consecutive quarter of sales productivity improvement. Sales productivity for Q3 2017 improved 11% organically over the same quarter last year. And looking forward, our sales pipeline is strong.","The Gartner Consulting segment had a mixed quarter in Q3. Most of the business performed well. Two specific teams had operational problems that we're addressing. One team had a higher-than-usual number of managing partner open territories, which, of course, impacts our bookings. The second team has a relatively high number of new managing partners and we expect their performance will improve as they gain experience.","In addition, our contract optimization business, which often has swings between quarters, was down 11% year-over-year. Looking forward, we've begun addressing these issues and our Consulting new business pipeline is strong.","The traditional Gartner Events business had a very strong quarter with a 25% increase in revenues, including an 18% increase in same event revenues. In short, across the traditional Gartner business, we've got great momentum and we expect to maintain this momentum as we continue to make progress with the integration of CEB.","Now, turn to the traditional CEB businesses. Contract value for the traditional CEB research and advisory business experienced a 1% decline in Q3, in line with our expectations. We're investing in this business to fuel future growth. We're hiring approximately 80 new sales professionals for this organization, and they'll be in territory early in 2018.","We introduced several new seat-based products that will deliver more value to functional business leaders in HR, finance, sales, legal and, of course, IT. We already made sales in all of these new products, and we have plans to introduce more new products at the beginning of 2018.","We expanded service teams to drive retention of these new products. Our sales and service support team has increased by about 40% through a combination of filling open positions and new roles to support growth and improve retention and retraining our teams on operational best practices and building service capabilities to support retention and growth. Taken together, these are broad-based initiatives that leverage Gartner best practices and build on the strong CEB foundation, creating a platform for enhanced growth and profitability.","As we discussed last quarter, we're executing as many of the larger changes as practical in 2017, which could create some speed bumps along the way. While there could be near-term challenges, we're confident that these are the right actions to position us best for the long term. I recently met with the sales leaders from this organization. They have incredible enthusiasm and support for the changes we're making and the opportunities for growth in this business.","Let me now turn to the TA & Other segment. Adjusted revenue in the TA & Other segment declined by 4% compared to a year-ago quarter. This is primarily due to a large number of open sales territories in the Talent Assessment business from prior to the acquisition. We've ramped up recruiting and substantially reduced the number of open territories, which positions us well for the future.","In addition, we've hired a strong leader experienced in talent assessment to lead this business. CEB Talent Assessment is a leading global provider of talent assessment solutions. They have best-in-class portfolio assessment tools, benchmark data and predictive technologies that equip organizations to assess, select and develop the right people for the right roles.","As I discussed last quarter, we established CEB's Talent Assessment as a standalone business. On October 4, we announced that we're exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives for this business. This business is an industry leader in attractive markets. However, it's not aligned with core focus of the rest of Gartner. Our goal is to determine how best to support innovation, product development and long-term growth for the talent assessment business, and we'll keep you updated on our progress.","We've also made some leadership changes at Gartner. Some of you may have seen that our former Head of Consulting, PA Waern, announced his retirement. PA was with Gartner for 19 years and led our Consulting business for more than a decade. Under PA's leadership, we transformed the Consulting organization to align with research in supporting the mission-critical priorities of our clients. In addition, PA led the development of our managing partner model, which significantly improved the value we deliver to our clients. We all wish him best in his retirement.","To build on PA's successes, I'm thrilled to announce that Scott Hensel has joined Gartner as Executive Vice President of Consulting, and he'll join Gartner's Operating Committee, reporting to me. Scott comes to Gartner from Terex, where he led their services business and was a member of their Executive Leadership team. Prior to Terex, Scott spent 14 years at McKinsey, serving clients in high-tech, industrial and business service sectors. He brings a wealth of experience in business transformation, strategy development, sales effectiveness and operations and organizational design. I'm excited about the level of operational execution and continuous improvement and innovation that Scott will bring to this important business segment.","We're now in the fourth quarter, which is when we run the majority of our Symposium\/ITxpo conference series. This remains our flagship event. It's held in eight locations around the world, designed to support CIOs and senior IT executives. I recently attended our U.S.-based event in Orlando, Florida, where thousands of CIOs convened to share experiences and gain key critical insights that helped them achieve their mission critical priorities. The CIOs there were inspired and felt empowered to succeed as a result of the insights we delivered at this important event. As you might imagine, this creates even more opportunity for our sales organization, and they're very excited as well.","In summary, I continue to be extremely excited about our business, our prospects for growth and our strategy to drive value for our shareholders over the long term. The combination of CEB and Gartner will create a quantum leap in capability and sustained extraordinary growth over the long term. Together, we'll be able to address the mission-critical priorities of every function across the enterprise with leading insights from the best of the two organizations.","Our outstanding Q3 results demonstrate our operational effectiveness on a global scale. We know the right things to do to drive success in our business. We're executing on a very aggressive integration plan, and in aggregate, it's going great. We're living in exciting times, and it's an exciting time for Gartner.","With that, I'll turn it over to Craig Safian, our Chief Financial Officer.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Gene. And good morning, everyone. Because of the tremendous value we provide to our clients around the world, the investments we are making to capture our vast market opportunity, our focus on strong operational execution and our exceptional business model, we delivered another strong quarter. On a combined basis, our adjusted revenue grew 11% in the third quarter of 2017. As Gene detailed, we are also progressing in accordance with our plans to integrate CEB into the Gartner business.","Please keep in mind that as we discuss our results, we will be looking at the total combined company on both a GAAP revenue and adjusted revenue basis. As we discussed last quarter, the only difference is that adjusted revenue excludes the deferred revenue fair value adjustment that is required as a part of purchase accounting. We will also, where appropriate or applicable, drill into the traditional Gartner or traditional CEB business performance. You will also find an in-depth overview of our Q3 performance in a presentation on our Investor Relations website.","Turning to our Q3 performance. Our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included total combined company adjusted revenue growth of 11%, driven by 15% growth for the traditional Gartner business and a 1% decline for the acquired CEB business; combined adjusted EBITDA of $149 million and combined adjusted diluted EPS of $0.65 per share, which is $0.13 above the top-end of our guidance range for the quarter. Please note that our third quarter 2017 GAAP revenues of $828 million includes an approximately $64 million deferred revenue adjustment. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our revenue for the quarter was $892 million.","Our exceptional business model continues to create a consistently high-level of free cash flow conversion. On a combined basis, over the last rolling four quarters, our free cash flow conversion was 139% of adjusted net income.","I'll now discuss our third quarter combined business segment results and P&L in depth, highlighting the performance of the traditional Gartner and acquired CEB business where appropriate before turning to our balance sheet and cash flow dynamics. I'll close with remarks on our updated 2017 guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions.","Please note that my segment discussion will focus on the adjusted revenue and adjusted contribution margin performance in Q3, therefore, adding back the deferred revenue fair value adjustment I just mentioned. Please also note that we've included a lot of this information in the presentation on our IR website.","Beginning with Research. On a combined basis, adjusted Research revenue grew 13% in the third quarter. The adjusted gross contribution margin for Research was 69% or an 80 basis point decline compared to the third quarter of 2016 on a comparable basis. This modest decline is primarily due to our newer-acquired businesses such as Capterra, SCM World and L2 having lower gross contribution margins than our traditional business.","I'll now focus on the traditional Gartner Research business. Adjusted revenues increased by 18% in the third quarter. Acquisitions, primarily L2 and Machina Research, contributed to adjusted revenue growth in the quarter by less than 2 points. We also had a roughly 1 point benefit from foreign exchange. Our other metrics for the traditional Gartner Research business also remained very strong with 15% CV growth, accelerating sales productivity and improvements in our retention metrics.","Total contract value was $2.063 billion as of the end of Q3. FX neutral growth of 15% versus the prior year, roughly in line with the growth we delivered last quarter. For reference in comparison, our Q3 2016 total contract value at current year FX rates was $1.790 billion. On an organic basis, excluding the contribution of L2, which we acquired in March 2017, total contract value growth for the traditional Gartner Research would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, also consistent with the growth we delivered last quarter.","We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business. From a traditional Gartner Research perspective, client retention was 83%, up 70 basis points from the third quarter of 2016 and flat on a sequential basis. Wallet retention ended at 104% for the quarter, up by 80 basis points year-on-year and roughly flat on a sequential basis. Both retention figures are close to our all-time highs.","New business growth for traditional Gartner Research remained strong, up 11% year-on-year in Q3. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades through existing clients. And as always, we also benefit from our annual price increases.","Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises. We ended the third quarter with 11,338 enterprise clients, up 6% compared to Q3 2016. The average spend for enterprise also continues to grow. It now stands at $182,000 per enterprise, up 8% versus prior year on an FX-neutral basis. This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CEB growth through both new and existing enterprises.","Turning to sales productivity for the traditional Gartner Research sales force, over the last rolling four quarters, we delivered $272 million of FX-neutral net contract value. When divided by our beginning-of-period head count, which was 2,331 quota-bearing heads, our rolling four-quarter productivity per account executive was $117,000. Excluding the impact of the L2 acquisition, sales productivity was up 11% year-on-year and 1% sequentially.","As always, we remain highly focused on improving our sales productivity. We remain confident that the initiatives around recruiting, training and tools that we have implemented to drive productivity will positively impact our results over both the short and long term.","Turning to the performance of CEB research in the quarter, CEB adjusted research revenues were flat year-on-year in Q3, a modest improvement from the year-on-year decline in Q2. We saw many positives with CEB's other research metrics in the quarter despite a modest decline in contract value. We ended Q3 with $571 million of traditional CEB research CV, down 1% on a year-over-year basis.","In addition, wallet retention, also using Gartner's methodology, ended the quarter at 93%, roughly flat compared to the year-ago quarter. While retention rates continue to show improvement, we did see a slowdown in new business as we implemented a number of Gartner best practices around pricing and contract terms. We also introduced a host of new seat-based products.","As we alluded to last quarter, we believe there would be speed bumps along the way as we integrated the CEB and Gartner businesses. We are confident these impacts are temporary and that the actions we are taking position us well to drive growth and value in the future.","Moving to Events, on a combined basis, adjusted Events revenues increased by 25% year-on-year in Q3. Events' third quarter adjusted gross contribution margin was 36%, up by approximately 40 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. CEB Events revenue increased 16% year-over-year in a seasonally low quarter for that business. The traditional Gartner Events business had a very strong quarter in Q3 with a 25% year-on-year increase in revenues, driven by an 18% increase in the same event revenues.","We continued to see strength in attendees reporting a 21% increase in same event attendees. Foreign exchange had a roughly 3-point benefit on our traditional Gartner Events reported revenues in the third quarter.","Turning to Consulting, third quarter Consulting revenues declined by 2% on a reported basis and declined 3% on an FX-neutral basis. In the labor-based business, revenues declined 1% versus Q3 of last year, while the contract optimization business was down 11%. On the labor-based side, global head count of 682 was up 8% and we had 134 managing partners at the end of Q3, a 17% increase over the year-ago quarter.","Broadly speaking, the MP strategy is working. As Gene described, we've experienced some operational challenges related to managing partner productivity on two teams. We'll be temporarily slowing down our MP growth on those two teams, so that we can focus on improving productivity. Once we see signs of improvement, we'll look again at increasing capacity on those teams.","Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business ended the quarter at $91 million, up 2% year-on-year. Our bookings performance strengthened in September and our Q4 pipeline looks strong as well. Consulting gross contribution margin decreased by 230 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to modest softness in the contract optimization business and a slight decline in utilization.","Turning to Talent Assessment & Other, adjusted revenue in the TA & Other segment declined by 4% compared to the year-ago quarter. This was consistent with the recent trends of our TA business. Both bookings and revenues have been impacted by a combination of a large number of open territories that existed at the time of the acquisition and the mix of lower tenured sales people as we filled those open territories. As we discussed on our last call, we also established TA as a standalone business. This caused some short-term disruptions that we feel are now behind us.","As Gene mentioned in early October, we decided to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives for the CEB Talent Assessment business, formerly known as SHL. This business makes up around two-thirds of the TA & Other segment and approximately 5% of total Gartner company adjusted revenues. We are less than one month into the process and I'm pleased to report that it is progressing well. We will provide further updates as and when appropriate.","Moving down the income statement, on a combined basis, SG&A increased by 13% year-over-year in the third quarter. FX had a roughly 1 point impact on the growth rate. Our sales force continues to be our largest investment and as of the end of the third quarter, the traditional Gartner business had 2,716 quota-bearing sales associates. This is an increase of 385 or 17% from a year ago. While this is an acceleration from prior quarters, the increase is primarily due to the fact that we were able to reduce the level of open territories in the quarter, which should help us in Q4 and subsequent quarters as well.","The acquisition of CEB adds more than 500 frontline quota-bearing research sales associates. We've been focused on filling open head count and are beginning to grow sales head count. We will leverage our proven best practices around recruiting, training and tools to drive accelerated CV growth and improved productivity.","As a growth company and now as a much larger growth company, we continue to invest in areas such as recruiting, technology, facilities and other areas to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long term. At the same time, we continue to make good progress on cost synergies related to the CEB acquisition, specifically in the G&A functions.","Through the investments we've already made and plan to make through the balance of the year to drive accelerated growth in CEB's contract value, we continue to expect modest net synergy flow-through in 2017. We continue to work the cost synergy side of the equation and we'll report back on our progress in subsequent quarters.","Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $149 million, which is essentially flat on a combined year-over-year basis. This result is driven by growth for traditional Gartner EBITDA, offset by year-over-year decline to traditional CEB EBITDA.","Moving down the income statement, depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter, predominantly reflecting the addition of CEB, while amortization and integration charges were up significantly, again related to the transaction. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.2%. Adjusting for acquisition and non-recurring charges, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29.3%.","The lower-than-expected adjusted tax rate impacted our Q3 adjusted EPS by about $0.05. The lower rate resulted largely from the timing of certain tax costs. We expect our full-year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% to 34% and approximately 31% to 32% on an adjusted basis.","GAAP diluted earnings per share was negative $0.53 in the third quarter. Our GAAP EPS figure also includes $1.18 of non-GAAP adjustments. Therefore on an adjusted basis, our EPS in Q3 was $0.65 or $0.13 above the high-end of our guidance range.","There are three primary reasons for our EPS beat in the quarter. First, EBITDA performance was better than forecasted. This contributed approximately $0.04 of upside. Second, below EBITDA, we have lower-than-forecasted depreciation as a result of purchase accounting adjustments as well as other incentive credits, which weren't forecasted. These two items contributed about $0.04 of upside. And third, our lower tax rate, as I just discussed, impacted our quarterly earnings per share by approximately $0.05.","Turning now to cash, in Q3, operating cash flow was $150 million compared to $120 million for standalone Gartner in the year-ago quarter. Our combined operating cash flow increased 16% year-over-year. It is also important to note that our Q3 operating cash flow includes significant acquisition and integration payments, which we adjust out for our free cash flow calculation.","Pivoting to free cash flow, Q3 2017 CapEx was $34 million and Q3 cash acquisition and integration payments were approximately $29 million. This yields Q3 free cash flow of $144 million, approximately 14% higher when compared to combined company free cash flow in Q3 2016. The timing of our contract value growth is a key driver of our quarterly free cash flow performance and our strong Research results from March Q2 and across Q3 have begun converting to free cash flow.","Turning to the balance sheet, relative to the approximately $3.6 billion of gross debt we had as of April 5, we have repaid around $245 million by the end of Q3 with a quarter-ending gross debt level of approximately $3.4 billion. From a net debt perspective, we had less than $2.8 billion at the end of Q3, which translates to approximately 4 times leverage on a combined last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA.","Given the favorable cash flow characteristics of the combined company, we remained firmly on schedule to delever to approximately 3 times gross leverage within the first two to three years of closing the acquisition.","Turning now to guidance, slide 13 of the presentation provides you with our updated outlook for 2017. As is our practice, our EPS guidance is on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. On a high level, we've modestly increased our adjusted revenue outlook and tightened our outlook for the full-year adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. At the same time, we've increased our EPS outlook on an adjusted EPS basis. And I'll also remind you that our full-year guidance includes 12 months of Gartner plus 9 months of CEB results.","Starting with revenue, for 2017, we expect combined company adjusted revenue of approximately $3.5 billion. This is comprised of the following. For Research, we expect combined adjusted revenues of between $2.6 billion and $2.625 billion. For the traditional Gartner Research business, we expect to continue our trend of mid-teen revenue growth in 2017. This is obviously supported by the very strong contract value growth we just reported.","For Consulting, we expect revenues of between $320 million and $335 million. For Events, we expect the adjusted revenues of between $330 million and $345 million. For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $210 million and $225 million. Again, these are adjusted revenue ranges. You will find the reconciliation of our adjusted revenue guidance ranges to GAAP revenue on slide 14 of the presentation.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA, as mentioned, we have narrowed our expected adjusted EBITDA range for 2017, trimming the high-end of our previous guidance range by $10 million. This modest reduction to the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance is driven by a few dynamics, the most notable of which relates to continued challenges in the TA business. As both Gene and I discussed earlier, the situation is getting markedly better as we fill open territories, but those improvements will not have an impact on the Q4 P&L.","As I commented last quarter, our GAAP 2017 earnings per share is expected to be significantly impacted by acquisition and integration charges, of which the vast majority are non-cash in nature. Slide 15 of the presentation reconciles the per share difference between our updated GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance ranges.","We now expect the after-tax impact of these adjustments to total approximately $4.20 at the midpoint of our guidance. Putting this all together, we now expect full-year 2017 adjusted EPS of between $3.39 and $3.50 per share, which is a $0.05 increase to the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance.","Slide 17 details the key assumptions below EBITDA that we have used to calculate our updated adjusted EPS outlook. For our tax rate, we project an annual effective rate for GAAP of approximately 33% to 34% and for adjusted earnings of approximately 31% to 32%. In addition, our tax rate may also vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the projected geographic mix of earnings, the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to stock-based awards as well as the timing of certain items. Finally, our EPS guidance is based on weighted average fully diluted share count of approximately 89.9 million to 90.5 million shares for the full-year 2017.","Before concluding, I'd like to provide a little more color around our fourth quarter outlook. As you know, the fourth quarter is our seasonally largest quarter. It's our largest Events and Consulting quarter. I'll also remind you that during the fourth quarter of 2016, we had some softness in both our Events and Consulting businesses. As we have rolled into the fourth quarter of 2017, we have great momentum in the traditional Gartner Research business and our NCVI performance through 2017 flows into the P&L.","We also had easier compares for both the Events and Consulting businesses, and that flows through as well. We are expecting to finish Q4 in the year strongly, consistent with our performance through the first three quarters of 2017.","In closing, we've continued our strong 2017 performance through the third quarter. Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth and contract value growth was 15%. We also saw acceleration in sales productivity, and our retention metrics are near all-time highs.","Our Events business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017, and the adjustments we are making in Consulting should position us strongly for the future. We are running a process to explore strategic alternatives for the Talent Assessment business and look forward to reporting back to you as that progresses. The traditional Gartner business is performing very well. The addition of CEB further strengthens our ability to capture the vast market opportunity ahead of us as we are now able to address the mission critical priorities of virtually all functional business leaders across every industry and size of enterprise worldwide.","As Gene mentioned, the integration is going exceptionally well. We set aggressive timelines, and we are achieving or beating them. As discussed last quarter, this has given us the confidence to accelerate a number of investments, such as growing the CEB sales force to accelerate our ability to capture the vast market opportunity that exists. We've done all of that while driving acceleration of performance in the traditional Gartner business.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh, William Blair. Please proceed.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. First, just on the CEB, I appreciate the color on. It was new sales, I guess, that were a little weaker and I know you gave a few reasons. But just, I guess, in general, can you elaborate on were there particular regions, particular types of clients? I guess, anymore color on and, I guess, how the business was impacted by some of the changes that you're making.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Tim. It's Gene. So, the CEB integration is going really well, and our plan calls for making the most disruptive changes, the biggest changes during 2017. We'd like to get that stuff out of the way. And so, we've made changes to new products as we talked about. We made changes to contract terms, we have changes to the ability to discount. So, lots of changes that we know position us well for the long term. That \u2013 when we make all those changes, sales people have to learn what those changes are and adapt with the journey and learn to actually work with those new clients.","And so, anytime you make that kind of change, there's going to be, as people learn, stops all the old products, starts on the new products and new terms, et cetera. There is going to be some time it takes to adapt to that.","What we saw actually has been fabulous, which is that our CD (36:26) growth in the CEB business was kind of on trend despite making all of those changes. And so, as Craig mentioned, retention was up, new business was down a little bit. I think given the rate of change, we have to be kind of \u2013 we've seen minimal disruption, given the extreme or given the significant changes we've made that position us very well for the future. So, overall, I'd say, it's kind of in the ballpark much better than we might have expected given the degree of change.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Do you have any sense or any signals about how long that disruption in the new business side can last, I guess, as people adjust?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, we don't know, but I'd say that I'm quite optimistic on what we've seen to-date that \u2013 if we look at kind of pipelines, how things are going, look, first, do people understand the changes that we're trying to make? Absolutely they understand it. Are they committed to making those changes? Do they believe in those changes, the sales people? Absolutely. In fact, that is going better than I would have expected. And if I look at the pipelines that people have developed with these new products, they're ahead of where I would have expected as well. And so, you can't be for sure, but I'd say the leading indicator is very positive.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And, Tim, it's Craig. The one other thing I'd mention is we talked about this last quarter too, we've really only been in the market with the new seat-based products for a very short period of time. And so, it's too early to give full market color or market feedback. What we can say is we've actually had sales in each and every one of those new seat-based products and again to Gene's point, in looking at pipeline and activity, those things look fairly favorable as well.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, one last one, I think you mentioned you're starting to grow the CEB sales force. How quickly at this point are you growing it? Even kind of as you exit the year, what would be the type of number?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, I'd give you flavor for it. Their existing sales force is a little over 500...","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","A little over 500.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","...salespeople. And as I mentioned in my remarks, both last time and this time, we're expecting to start 2018 with at least 80 more salespeople. And so, it gives you a flavor for the growth rate there.","In addition to that, there are people that do sales and service support that are more junior people, who've joined this Gartner for a long time. That team increased the size by about 40%. It's not total 40% growth positions, because there were a lot of open positions, but between closing the open positions that were already there and then the additional growth, it's quite substantial. So, we'll go into 2018 with a sales force that's larger in those two dimensions.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And I think, Tim, just to add to that point, the same can be said on the traditional Gartner sell side as well, where we filled more open territories than we've historically done. In fact, we're probably \u2013 we're at historical low levels of open territories, which is a positive. And again, that should start flowing through or gives us a bigger army, if you will, as we head into the fourth quarter, but most notably as we head into 2018.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the questions on sales in CEB, can you give us some flavor about how you think about the folks that are going through your sales training and then selling the CEB product? How do we think about when they get to sort of a normalized productivity? Is a year a reasonable range? I know you've talked about your legacy business. The second year is a lot better than the first and it grows for a while, but is there a learning curve that's going to be different? Is the training you're providing different or should we think that the investments you begin to make mid-year this year really should be impacting CV at some point in 2018? Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, Gary, it's Gene. So, when we've done acquisitions in the past and brought sales people and make similar changes, which we've done in places like when we bought AMR, for example, who had \u2013 we did enterprise agreements, same kind of changes, which did META, we found that, and this is \u2013 we found the same thing with CEB here, that the salespeople are very talented and knowledgeable, know how to sell a syndicated research kind of product. And so, it's not like starting with a salesperson from a different industry off the street. That's just starting with someone who understands what we're trying to do, understands their market.","And so, while someone off the street might take three years to get fully up to speed, what we found in previous acquisitions is that once we train people in the new terms and the new products that they get up to speed quite quickly and much faster than the three years. And so, I'm expecting \u2013 and CEB again, we found the salespeople to be just terrific. They really understand what they're doing, quite talented sales people. And so, I'd expect the transition is going to be much quicker than if we had people off the street.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And the other thing I'd add, Gary, good morning, is fundamentally the new seat-based products, because they do leverage best of both research from the traditional CEB side and from a traditional Gartner side and because they are seat-based products sold to a specific individual and then servicing a specific individual are, by their very nature, higher value products. And so, what we're doing is transforming the way that the CEB sales force has sold, but they are selling what we believe to be a significantly higher value product over the long term as well.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And what have you done with the product specifically to make it that \"higher value product\"? You talked at the time of the acquisition about adding some mobile capabilities, overtime working in some Gartner Research concepts and ultimately just \u2013 that's the option if you're a new customer to buy it that way. But are there other changes to the product that are going to start to allow you to upgrade that into the existing base or should we think that's more of a longer-term strategy? Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, the fundamental changes to the product, first, the product is a seat-based product, which is an important difference, because it's about providing value to that individual. And so, right off the bat, you start off with a product that provides more value, because it's a value to a specific person. And so, just through design of the product starts with it.","The second thing we've done is that we have added content from both Gartner and from CEB and that's true with every functions. So, our CFO is in here, I'll use finance as an example, many of the issues in finance are technology-related as well. We had existing Gartner Research that's very relevant for CFOs and their teams making decisions on technology. And it's a big area issue. That was not a strong point of CEBs.","And so, if you take the traditional CEB content plus you add in the technology-oriented content, that would be relevant for a CFO or Head of HR or any of the other roles within a company, you have more content in addition to a product that's structured better, you actually have additional content. And the third thing we've done is in terms of research processes, Gartner and CEB had different kinds of processes. We've taken both of those \u2013 all the new products have both the traditional Gartner Research process, which was about analysts doing expert-based research, combine that with the CEB, which is about more using case studies and research based on what clients are actually doing, that adds more value than again either one did alone.","And so, these new products are a combination \u2013 better structured. It has a combination of both technology clients as well as business content. And in addition to that, it has both types of research. And so, fundamentally, these are much higher value products than people had in the past. And so, we expect they will sell really well. And, in fact, the early returns are great. Sales force is very \u2013 the CEB sales force is very excited about these new products and we expect they'll retain better as well.","And then, lastly, and we've already seen this of the new sales, there's going to be a mix of sales and we've already seen clients that were CEB clients with the old products saying, hey, these new products are great. I want to upgrade to those new products and so you can upgrade right there as well. (45:03) upgrade, but I think when people see the value, this is the experiences we've had in the past as well.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler, Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. I know Gartner's always about continuous improvement, but in terms of the major changes you're planning to make to the CEB, I guess, sales processes and products, have they been made at this point or are you halfway through rolling them out? Just any commentary on that.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, at Gartner, we have a lot of really good approaches in recruiting, training and tools for salespeople, and it will take time to enlist all of those. It'll take a couple years, probably, to enlist all of those. What we're doing is starting with the highest leverage ones first. So, we're kind of taking the low-hanging fruit first, ones that have the highest impact. And so, we're focused on making sure we execute those things first. And so, what you'll see is that while it'll take a couple years to get everything fully implemented, we're focused on the highest leverage items first and so we get the biggest bang from those things as well.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, on the acceleration in the traditional Gartner sales force head count growth and I know that it's closing some previously open territories, but anything in particular that's driving that new recruiting strategies, compensation plans or just why the step-up?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, two things, really. One is that we know that we sell more in a territory that has a salesperson that compare with one that doesn't have a salesperson. (46:51), because you have people that either don't perform and so they're not a good fit with Gartner or they get promoted, become managers or go to a more senior sales role, they get another area. So, you always have some level of turnover and we've been conscious of that.","So, one of the strategies we've had is how can we be innovative and reduce those number of open sales territories. And it has to do with how we recruit, how long the recruiting pipeline is, things like that. And we've done some fundamental innovations there that have allowed us to focus on reducing those territories.","The second piece of it is and, again, this has to do with innovations in our recruiting process, is that we have been continually improving our ability to identify really talented sales people. And so, the two things that made this come together now are, first, a purposeful explicit strategy of making sure we have fewer open sales territories in designing, recruiting and how we run sales to do that, and then, secondly, improvements in our whole recruiting approach and process that has identified really \u2013 people that are really a great fit, which has allowed us to accelerate that at this point in time.","And so, you can think about it, again, we're still aiming to grow the sales force at about 13% and the other 4% is closing territories that otherwise would have been open. And, of course, like I said, we're somewhere in a higher (48:12) retention with that.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, just finally, with the accelerated sales force side growth on the traditional IT side and then, is the 80 and 500 totally comparable? Are you saying 16% growth in the CEB side and then, I guess, related to that with teens growth in both, any early read on how to start thinking about 2018 margins?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, on the first part of your question, there is a bit over 500 people, varies day-to-day, but about 517 salespeople in the traditional CEB selling organization. So, we've added 80. And so, you can do the math on what percent growth that is. Now, obviously, the 80 people will be in their first year as a salesperson and we know they sell less in their first year than they do in their second year and less in their second year than they do in their third year. And so, this is an investment that's going to pay off over the next three years and thereafter, but will accelerate over the next three years.","And so, you can calculate kind of \u2013 you can estimate what the growth is there. Obviously, it'll take time to ramp up. We're very happy with the quality. Because we're planning to having the in-territory already trained, ready to go January 1, a lot these people actually are already on board and in training and the quality of sales people is just terrific. They are a great fit for the business.","And then, the second part of your question, I'll let Craig answer.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","So, I mean the other thing I'd just add on Gene's point is on the 80, we are \u2013 that is not 80 in one area, one function. So, it's actually spread out across the various functional sales teams that we have selling on the business side. So, I think HR, finance, marketing, et cetera and it's also distributed geographically as well. So, it sounds like a big number in terms of the absolute growth rate, but again like we do on the Gartner side, we are managing it, so that it's not wildly disruptive in terms of our go-to-market and selling processes for next year.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","In fact, just on that point, we did the same thing there as we did in Gartner. In the past, you heard me talk about what determines the growth rate that we achieved in our sales force fundamentally is management capacity, where do we think we have managers that have the capacity to grow? And so, as we look at the CEB sales force, we looked at where there is management capacity. And so, just adding the 80 or so sales people had to do with looking at an individual first-line manager, where are their first-line managers throughout the organization that had additional capacity. They're performing well and they have a capacity to take on additional head count growth or people that we could promote to managers that we think would have that capacity as well. So, this was done in a bottoms-up way just as we've always done in Gartner.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And, Jeff, the second part of your question, just remind me again.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Just the implications for an early 2018 margin outlook with accelerating head count growth on both sides.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean, the way to think about that is on the Gartner side, we've been focused on adding in areas where we are doing the best and obviously slowing down in areas that are a little more challenged. The good news is, as our average productivity has shown improvement for the last couple of quarters, that gives us the confidence in more areas quite frankly.","And again, we do expect given that we've seen this increase in the second half of 2017, they are in territory and they will be selling in Q4 and obviously they're in their first year. But as they progress in their tenure, you can look to see nice improvements over time in their overall productivity.","We're not at a point yet where we're giving 2018 guidance, but I do think the way to think about it, particularly on the traditional Gartner side is, we will enter 2018 at current course and speed with a larger army and we are very focused on driving the productivity of that army as we head into 2018.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh, Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a two-part one to start off, following back up on the softer new sales at CEB. Is this more of the sales force needing to ramp up to the new changes? Is it more sort of the pricing that's a pushback, the contract structure being a pushback from clients or are they all two interrelated of factors to parse it out that way?","And, Gene, I realized there was a \u2013 a while ago, that Gartner underwent this change, but is the reception or pushback, the disruptions you're seeing in line with what you had seen back then or are there some other complications that you'd call out?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, on the question about the new business impact, what I'd say is the impact is very limited and that there's a combination of factors. Like for example, I mentioned earlier, some of the \u2013 there were bunch of open territories with the sales and support teams. Those actually helped generate some of the new business by identifying opportunities and helping salespeople. So, I think that \u2013 and we'd now fill those, which is great.","And then, secondly, in terms of the rate \u2013 the change, the sales force as I said earlier, yeah, there's two things you want to focus on. One is do they understand and want to do the changes? And secondly, do they actually have the skills to make those changes? We kind of call it will and skill. On the will side, we are 100% there. I mean I think from the sales leaders down to the front-line salespeople, that people totally understand what we're trying to do and are committed to it and that's gone at a much faster pace and has much better acceptance than I would have even expected.","And then, also on the skill side, where it takes time to adjust your selling process and again I'd say that's actually going faster than I would have expected. And so, I would characterize the kind of change in new business, maybe half of it is due to a sort of the open more junior support people, which is now filled, and other half of it, and this is not a big problem anyway, was due to the adjusting to the new world we live in. And so, you asked me to compare it to, when we made these exchanges at Gartner, but also with Gartner \u2013 after Gartner, we had META, we've bought META, we had AMR and we've bought AMR, had Burton, we've bought got Burton.","So, we've gone through this journey a lot and especially compared to when we did this with Gartner, our ability to help people understand what the changes are and develop their enthusiasm around and why is that good for them, is great. In fact, if I compare it, this is going much faster than any of the other ones we've done. Despite being very large, it's growing much faster than any of the ones we've done.","We knew it was going to be a lot because it's such a large organization compared to our previous acquisitions. So, we put a real focus on change management, and that's really paying off. And so, if I compare it to the past, either what we did at Gartner or with other smaller acquisitions, this is going very smoothly and very quickly.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Anj, I think the other thing I'd add is we talked about this last quarter, and we talked about it, again, this quarter. These are absolutely the right things to do to support and drive future sustained growth. And, I think what we're seeing in terms of dislocation or impact is kind of noisy a little bit in terms of the overall results. Again, with all these changes, as Gene mentioned earlier, CEB contract value is still kind of on-trend to what its performance had been prior to the acquisition, while we're getting ourselves ready to actually tune up the machine and drive growth into the future.","So, we're 100% committed that these are the right things to do. Again, we've done it on the Gartner side historically. We've run the same kind of plays when we've done other similar type of acquisitions that had similar business characteristics to what we've inherited or what we acquired from the CEB deal. And so, again, we're thinking about this around laying the foundation for future growth and, again, having seat-based products, having them with the right kind of contract terms, having them with pricing discipline are all the right things to do as we head into the future.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Got it. That's great color. A quick one on EBITDA, the change there, I just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. Is that entirely being driven by the softer TA outlook or is there some impact from the core CEB business performance or your higher sales force head count at Gartner?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question, Anj. What's happening there is predominantly related to the TA business. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a number of dynamics happening in there. Some significantly smaller and going in both directions quite frankly. Really, probably I'd highlight one other specific item, which we alluded to in our Consulting comments, is we are still seeing a little bit of a productivity lag. And that obviously we can only burn the revenue that we have in backlog.","And while we did see some nice uptick or uptick rather in the backlog position from Q2 to Q3, we're still not exactly where we'd love to be on those two teams. And so, there is a little bit of a drag related to the EBITDA adjustment from Consulting. But, again, the way to think about it is it's predominantly related to the continued trends on a TA business, and there's a variety of other little or smaller puts and takes in there as well.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi, Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hey, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking our call. We noticed this year in the Events segment, we're seeing a good uptick in the number of attendees per event. Could you give us a little color on what you think is driving that uptick there?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Hey. It's Gene. So, there's two things that are driving the uptick. One is that, for our research clients, many of them get an entitlement to go to an event, and we know when they go to an event, they get a lot of value in that event. And so, we had growth in the research business, which has more people that are entitled and then, of those people that are entitled, a higher percentage of them going to the event because of our encouragement, because we know they get value. That's one piece of it.","Then, the second piece of Events growth is that we know that people get a lot of value going to the event even if they're not a research client and those that come could be prospective future research clients. And so, we have a very active and quite innovative program to sell tickets to people that are not existing research clients, again, both for the value they get initially as well as because they learn about Gartner and they could be research clients in the future.","And so, it's a combination of those things, both the \u2013 getting more of our existing clients and secondly having really terrific marketing programs that drive people that have challenges in their IT business to go to those events. And by the way, we're going to do the same thing on the CEB side. CEB did not have those capabilities. And CEB, again, has great events. We're going to be (01:00:12) marketing programs to drive a lot higher percentage of non-research clients to the CEB events.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And, Mike, fundamentally, our reason for being in the Events business is to provide that amazing experience for the end-users. And Joe was at our Orlando event and many of you on the call were at our Orlando event as well. That's the kind of experience that we want to provide to all of our attendees that go to our events across the entire portfolio. And it's just a great opportunity for, as Gene mentioned, Gartner seat holders to go and actually experience the research live and for non-Gartner seat holders to go and experience the research live. And the reason that they're willing to carve out a couple days of their busy schedules and buying a ticket is because they get so much value at that event.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. Thanks. And then, in Consulting, you said some of the issues revolved around just a couple of teams. Have you ever given a number of total teams that are in the Consulting business?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. So, the way to think about it is we're organized by geography and practice and some are organized just by geography and some places, where we're larger, we're organized by a combination of region or geography and practice. What I'd say is we talked about two specific teams here. It's out of several across the entire Consulting organization. So, as Gene mentioned in his comments, and I think I did as well, broadly speaking, the Consulting business is performing well. We're driving very strong managing partner productivity, broadly speaking again, across the business. We have two pockets of challenges. Gene described in detail the specific challenges for each of those teams. We are working them, and we expect to have those things in much better shape as we roll into 2018.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Please proceed.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thank you. The first question is just on the CEB sales force growth of 16%, is that number big enough? And the reason I ask is if I look at CEB, they didn't invest in SG&A at all. In 2015, it was 1% growth; 2016, it was low-single digits. And so, just curious, is there a catch-up spend on the CEB sales force you need to do or do you feel comfortable with current capacity in the system?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, we aspire to have really good double-digit growth with CEB for a long time, for decades. So, that's going to take a lot of sales force growth. And so, again, I think in terms of sales capacity, we'd love to have it 10 times as big as it is today and we will some day. But, in the short term, we felt like, as we get started, that to open up 2018 \u2013 let me back up. So, as I said, the way we determine how fast to grow the sales force, what's our operational capability is fundamentally limited by the bandwidth of our management team.","As we look to the management team at CEB today that we could get this level of growth, which we think will be on or ahead of track of what we would have expected. And that won't be the last time we had sales people at CEB. We will keep adding as we see management capacity there. And so, I take it as this is the first big \u2013 the first trajectory change, not the last.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, Hamzah, it's Craig. Just to add to that, I think your observation around lack of or limited investment is 100% spot on. And that's probably true across a number of other areas of the business, but particularly on the sales side, but again, what we need to do, given the fact that we are implementing so much change, again we have to manage how much change and disruption teams can handle at one time.","And again what we've done and we've learned this through experience on our own side is you have to find that right balance and the additional 80 right now in terms of that, first foray of significant growth, coupled with all the other operational change we're implementing is what we believe to be the right balance right now. If we are performing better, we'll figure out how to go faster. If it's not going to plan, we'll figure out how to tweak it to make it go faster. But think of this as kind of foray one in terms of injecting growth and investment into supporting longer-term sustainable growth for the CEB contract value business.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good. That's very helpful. Just a follow-up and I'll turn it over, just on the Consulting business, could you remind us of the lag from when you hire a new managing partner to when you start seeing business come in? Is that lag different than on the sales force side in the legacy Research business? Just curious on the Consulting side. Thank you.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, when we hire a new managing partner, those managing partners more than pay for themselves in their first year and their productivity continues to improve over the next two years. So, it's pretty much a wrap-up like sales, which should take three years typically to get the full productivity. But the people we hire in general do very well their first year as well.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And the one difference we generally have on the managing partner side as compared to the research sell side is a portion of our managing partners, our promotions is from within. And so, in those cases, while their \"more junior\" from managing partner perspective, they know Gartner, they know our capabilities, they have relationships with Gartner clients, et cetera. So, those, while generally smaller numbers, tend to ramp up to productivity a little bit more quickly than people coming from the outside. So, we have a mix and again it varies by region. So, there's really no answer around how much is promotion versus how much is hired externally, but we are dealing with those two populations as we grow our managing partner capacity.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I was just wondering if you saw any increase in the demand in cyber research following the Equifax data breach and just some examples of maybe what products might apply in that case where people would be focused on trying to increase their cybersecurity.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, Toni, cybersecurity is clearly a very hot area for us. We have a security conference that is growing at very rapid rates and the demand in our security analyst is kind of at capacity, because of \u2013 as you said, it's so visible in the world today and every company needs to deal with it. So, it's clearly a very hot topic area for us.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And, Toni, the one thing I'd say from a product perspective, and this is sort of the beauty of the Gartner product portfolio, is you're buying an annual subscription and you have access to all that security content when you need it. But tomorrow, the issue might not be security, it might be moving to the cloud or it might be digitalizing your business.","And so, again, we're not generally speaking of consulting organization, where we're going in with spot solutions. We do have a consulting team that actually does help with those kinds of things, but our research business, again, which is three quarters of our overall business, it's really about selling the annual subscription and giving our clients the view that the value proposition is broad and deep when they need it.","And so, when security is a big deal, they have access to that security stuff. When cloud is a big deal for them, they have access to the cloud stuff. It certainly doesn't hurt as a conversation starter around, hey, you read about the Equifax breach last night or last week, rather, we have great stuff that can actually help you out, that's absolutely true. But, again, the beauty of our products and offerings are it's a 12-month subscription with access to everything when you want it and on demand.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then, Gene, you mentioned contract optimization was down 11% this quarter. Is there anything that you would attribute that to based on what you're hearing from customers or, I know that tends to be volatile, so could this quarter just be a little bit of an anomaly and not really more of a trend in delaying purchases?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Toni, it's Craig. I think it's absolutely the latter as you just described it. Just to put it in perspective, Q3 generally is a pretty small quarter for our contract optimization business. So, about a 11% down was worth roughly $1 million. And on a year-to-date basis, our contract optimization business is actually up nicely year-over-year. So, it was a little bit of a blip in Q3, nothing we'd say or see from a trend perspective, in fact probably opposite, given on a year-to-date basis that we are performing better than last year comparably.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And just one last one for me, in Research, despite all of the challenges that we've all been talking about on \u2013 earlier in this call on the CEB side, you did raise the Research guidance \u2013 revenue guidance a bit. So, can you talk about maybe what was particularly better than what you previously expected on the legacy Gartner side? Thanks.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, Toni. It was a pretty modest increase on a very large number. I think two things there. One is the traditional Gartner Research performance has improved consistently over the course of this year. Yeah, so we saw acceleration from Q1 to Q2 up to 15% growth. We stated 15% growth in Q3. And that, as we talked about a little bit, as we described our Q4 guidance, that is flowing through. That's the bulk of it.","As always, we're adjusting for latest foreign exchange rates and things like that. And so, there's a little bit of modest tweaking on each of the revenue lines, but from a research perspective, it's really predominantly driven by our year-to-date NCVI performance on the traditional Gartner business.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is actually (01:11:57). So, I just had a quick question about any momentum in recent strategic initiatives like a rollout of D&B Hoovers and other product initiatives you guys have? Any color you can provide on those would be great.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","I'm sorry Kevin (01:12:12), could you repeat that? I didn't catch all that come across (01:12:16).","Unknown Speaker","Sorry. Yeah, I was asking about recent strategic initiatives like the rollout of D&B Hoovers and the products. Any color you could provide on those? Hello?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. We're here.","Unknown Speaker","Can you hear me? Sorry.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","That's not part of our products.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Sorry.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, that's not what we anticipate.","Unknown Speaker","Yes. Okay. And then, so CEB total contract value down and are there some underlying, I guess, effect \u2013 the trends affecting CEB research business. I know CEB has been stronger with larger clients. And I guess with the industry overall moving from seat-based pricing \u2013 enterprise pricing and you guys moving in the opposite direction, so were you in the process of penetrating smaller clients, which is where CEB particularly has not done as well?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, two things I'd say. One is that Gartner, we serve all size clients. We serve everything from the largest companies, enterprises of the world, down to \u2013 enterprise base down to small enterprises. And we've done it very successfully. All segments have grown at great double-digit rates, quarter effort for many, many, many quarters. And so, we're good at all segments.","We're taking that same expertise and applying it to CEB as well. They do have a business that's comparable to that sort of midsized enterprises, just like Gartner does. The talent there is terrific. As we've introduced products just as we \u2013 so, we've introduced new products not only for each functional area, but also we have distinct products for large enterprises versus the smaller ones. Because of the combination I think of products that are tailored, it's the same thing we've done in Gartner that made us successful, which is combination of products that are tailored for those specific market segments being the midsize segment as well and applying the same processes that we do in \u2013 have at traditional Gartner. We feel really good that CEB will perform really well in the midsize enterprise base just as well as Gartner had.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Hall for closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, to summarize the key points for today's call, first, the combination of CEB and Gartner creates a quantum leap in capability and sustained extraordinary growth over the long term. We'll be able to address the mission critical priorities for every function across the enterprise with leading insights from the best of the both of two organizations.","During Q3, the performance of traditional Gartner business continued to accelerate. We functionally integrated CEB and launched a host of new seat-based products. We introduced new commercial terms, accelerated sales force hiring and we're exploring strategic alternatives for the Talent Assessment business.","Thanks for join us today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q3 2015 earnings call.","While our business continues to deliver robust results with demand for our services being driven by the digital industrial economy, having completed the third quarter of the year, our underlying metrics are strong. We continued to capture the opportunity ahead of us with the successful execution of our proven strategy for growth. As I've done in the past, I'll review our key operating metrics on an FX-neutral basis since that's the best way to understand the overall health of our business.","For the third quarter of 2015, we delivered double digit growth in contract value, revenues and earnings per share. Total company revenues were up 13% and EBITDA was 17% higher than this time last year. Research, our largest and most profitable segment, delivered our 23rd consecutive quarter of double-digit CV growth. For Q3 2015, we drove double digit contract value growth in every region across every client size and in every industry segment.","During the quarter we achieved another new milestone in Research, with more than 10,000 enterprises as our clients. We continued to invest in improved recruiting capabilities, training and tools, which in turn allow us to drive sales productivity improvements over time. Growing sales capability and capacity is a mission-critical priority for us. For Q3 2015, we grew sales head count by 16% and sales productivity improved compared to this time last year.","In Consulting, one of our core strategies is to increase the number of managing partners. We ended the quarter with 105 managing partners, up 22% over last year, and we maintained a healthy four months of backlog. Our Events business continues to deliver robust double digit growth. On a same-events basis, we drove a revenue increase of 22% year over year.","We continue to deploy our capital strategically with acquisitions and share repurchases as our priority use of capital. We announced two acquisitions last quarter, Nubera and Capterra. Both businesses strengthen our offerings in the small business space.","Year to date, we purchased $453 million of our shares. Craig will give you more detail on all our business results in a moment.","We're currently in the middle of our flagship conference series, Symposium\/ITxpo. Gartner Symposium is the world's most important gathering of CIOs and senior IT executives. We host this series in eight locations around the world, including South Africa, Brazil, Dubai, India, Japan, Australia, Spain, and Orlando, Florida. This event series convenes thousands of CIOs, who share experiences and gain valuable insights that help them achieve their mission-critical priorities. In addition to being the most important gathering of CIOs, it's also the largest gathering of technology leaders in the world. There's truly nothing else like it on the planet.","I just returned from the events we held in Florida and Australia. While onsite at both events, I met with a number of CIOs and enterprise leaders from a diverse array of industries. These leaders are experiencing firsthand the effects of digital business. They're looking to Gartner for answers to tough challenges, cybersecurity, disruption, business transformation, and Gartner delivers. The CIOs I met with said they felt inspired and better equipped to succeed in digital business as a result of our insights.","Symposium\/ITxpo is one of the best ways clients and prospects alike can experience the breadth and depth of what Gartner has to offer. Throughout these events, I also had the option to speak with a large number of our salespeople from all around the world. Whether new or experienced, all of them had incredible excitement and enthusiasm about the event, the value we deliver to our clients, and our incredible market opportunities.","One of the primary reasons our Events business and our overall business has been so successful is our people. Gartner is a people business. Over the past several years, we've made significant investments in our people. We added analysts around the world. We invested in recruiting and in training. We improved our customer service processes. We invested heavily in improving sales productivity. And these investments are paying off. The insights we create, the advice we deliver, and the overall experience for our customers has never been better, and we're not slowing down. We'll continue to improve and innovate across every area of our business.","We know how to be successful in any economic environment. We're relevant whether an institution is growing or facing economic challenges, and we continue to deliver double-digit results due to the tremendous value we deliver to our clients.","I remain confident in and excited about Gartner. Technology continues to change the world, and Gartner is the heart of technology. Gartner is the single best source for enterprises to get the insight they need to understand where and how to successfully harness technology to achieve their mission-critical priorities. We have more impact on end users and technology providers than any other company in the world.","We're getting better, stronger, faster every day. We have a vast market opportunity, a powerful value proposition, a winning strategy, and an exceptional business model. Gartner is a stellar growth company with outstanding prospects for accelerated and sustained growth for years to come.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Craig.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone.","Gartner continued its strong operational and financial performance in the third quarter, delivering double-digit growth in contract value, revenue and EBITDA on an FX-neutral basis, and remains poised to do the same for the full year 2015.","I will discuss each business segment's performance in depth shortly, but for the quarter our year-over-year performance on an FX-neutral basis was as follows. Contract value increased 14%, with Research revenue growing 16%, Events revenues increased 22% on a same-event basis. Consulting revenues declined by 3%. Normalized EBITDA increased 17%.","We continue to see robust demand for our services across all of our business segments, and our business has delivered consistent double digit growth quarter after quarter, year after year. We are engaged on our clients' most important initiatives and projects. Our strong retention metrics demonstrate the value our clients receive from our products and services.","We are making great progress in capturing our market opportunity, finding new IT, supply chain, and digital marketing professionals to sell to every day. We are further penetrating existing accounts and winning new enterprise accounts. We remain confident that we will continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance over the near and long term.","I will first discuss the performance of each of our three business segments for the third quarter, give color around our P&L and balance sheet, discuss our recent acquisitions, and finally share our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2015. Then we will open up the call for questions.","As a global business, it is worth noting that the strengthening U.S. dollar has continued to impact our reported results. Just about every currency we operate in is weaker against the U.S. dollar when compared to last year. While the decline in the euro has leveled off, a few additional currencies, most notably the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar, have recently seen further weakness against the U.S. dollar. I will comment on the impact of foreign exchange on each of our business segments as I discuss them, beginning with Research.","Research revenue grew 8% on an as-reported basis and 16% on an FX-neutral basis in the third quarter. Our recently announced acquisitions had a less than one point impact on our revenue growth for the quarter. The gross contribution margin for Research was 69%, up 70 basis points compared to third quarter 2014. On a year-to-date basis, the gross contribution margin remained at 70%, matching our target for this segment. All of our other Research business metrics remain very strong. Contract value grew to $1.643 billion, a growth rate of 11% year over year on a reported basis and 14% on an FX-neutral basis. As Gene previously mentioned, our growth in contract value was broad-based, with every region, every client size and every industry segment growing at double-digit rates.","We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business. Client retention was 84%, roughly the same as third quarter 2014. Wallet retention ended at 106% for the quarter, maintaining its historical high and representing a one point improvement over the third quarter of last year. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retain a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we have discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a four-quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","New business increased year over year, up 8% from last year's third quarter. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. Our contract value growth also benefits from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting. We have increased our prices by at least 3% every year since 2005. We recently implemented a price increase on October 1 that averaged just north of 3%.","Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises. As a result, for the first time we crossed the 10,000 enterprise mark, ending the quarter with 10,093 client enterprises, up 9% over last year's third quarter, and the average spend per enterprise continues to grow on an FX-neutral basis, again reflecting our ability to increase our contract value by driving growth in both new and existing enterprises.","Sales productivity improved once again. We are up 5% on an FX-neutral basis as compared to last year. As we have detailed in the past, we calculate sales productivity as the net contract value increase, what we call NCVI, per account executive. We look at it on a rolling four quarter basis to eliminate seasonality and we use opening sales head count as the period denominator. Over the last 12 months, we grew our contract value by $205 million in FX-neutral terms. Using our Q3 2014 ending sales head count of 1,820 as the beginning of period denominator, yields NCVI per AE of $113,000 on a rolling four quarter basis. Again, that's a 5% improvement over the third quarter of last year and the comparable figure was $107,000 per account executive at constant currency rates.","To sum up our Research business, we delivered another strong quarter with retention rates at or near historical highs and contract value growth of 14%. Most importantly, we continue to see very strong demand for our Research products and services. Looking forward, our pipeline is very strong and our head count growth has accelerated. The programs we have in place to drive productivity around recruiting, training and tools are working. We anticipate ongoing improvements to sales productivity, which positively impact CV growth and subsequently Research revenue growth over the long-term.","Moving to Events; for the quarter, our Events segment delivered exceptional results. On an FX-neutral basis, Events revenues increased 38% year over year. We held three more events in this quarter than in the same quarter last year. As I noted earlier, on a same-event basis, revenues were up 22% year over year. During the quarter, we held 15 events with 7,215 attendees compared to 12 events with 5,606 attendees in the third quarter of 2014. Q3 is a seasonally light quarter for Events as Symposium season begins early in Q4.","On the same-event and FX-neutral basis, Events revenues grew 22%, with 6,451 attendees, a 9% increase compared to third quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, Events revenue is up 19% over the prior year, with 49 events versus 47 events in the same period last year. The gross contribution margin for Events increased roughly 9 percentage points from the third quarter a year ago to 39%. On a year-to-date basis, we improved gross contribution margin by approximately 4 points to 46%.","Turning now to Consulting; on an as-reported basis, revenues in Consulting decreased 9% in the third quarter and decreased 3% FX-neutral. In the quarter, on an FX-neutral basis, our labor-based business was up slightly over last year. Consulting was largely impacted in the quarter by our contract optimization practice. As we've discussed in the past, our contract optimization practice has a higher degree of variability than the other parts of our Consulting business, which can significantly impact the results of this segment, either positively or negatively.","Across the entire Consulting business, we continue to see strong demand for our services, and our ongoing investment in managing partners is allowing us to capture that demand. We now have 105 managing partners, a 22% increase over the third quarter 2014. The underlying operating metrics of our Consulting business also remain strong. On the labor-based side, billable head count of 588 was up 10% from this point in 2014. Third quarter annualized revenue for billable head count ended at $371,000. The decline in revenue per billable head was driven mostly by FX, with the balance split between modestly lower utilization and a richer mix of less senior consultants, who bill at lower rates.","Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $110 million, up 5% over this time last year on an FX-neutral basis. With the current backlog and visibility we have into the pipeline, we believe the Consulting business will finish 2015 with solid results.","Moving down to the income statement; SG&A increased by $19 million year over year during the third quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force. As of September 30, we had 2,111 direct quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 291 or 16% from a year ago. For the full year, we expect to grow the sales force by 15% to 16%. In the third quarter, SG&A was higher as a percentage of revenues due to continued investments in our sales capacity and recruiting and training capabilities.","Moving on to EBITDA and earnings; we delivered another solid quarter of earnings growth. Normalized EBITDA was $80 million in the third quarter, up 7% year over year on a reported basis and up 17% on an FX-neutral basis. Our Q3 EPS results include a $0.04 benefit from the sale of tax credits. The benefit arose out of a favorable state tax audit settlement. This result meant we had tax credits that would have been unutilized, so we were able to sell the credits and record the benefit to our P&L on the other income line. We do not expect this to be a recurring event.","Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 41.4%. On a year-to-date basis, the effective tax rate is 37.4%. These rates are trending higher than our guidance for two primary reasons. First, a significant amount of the expenses we are incurring related to our recent acquisitions are not tax deductible. And second, our mix of earnings continues to shift towards higher tax jurisdictions, primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar.","When we look at a normalized tax rate or the tax rate that corresponds with our EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges, we see that the rate for Q3 and Q3 year to date was 38.2% and 36.5%, respectively. These are the tax rates to apply to our pre-tax income, excluding acquisition and integration charges, to model out earnings per share. These rates are modestly higher than our initial guidance due to mix of earnings.","On a year-over-year basis, the increase in our tax rate is driven by foreign tax credit benefits that occurred in 2014, that are not repeating in 2015. As I've said earlier, the year-over-year rate is also impacted by the non-deductibility of acquisition charges and mix of earnings, which again is driven by the stronger U.S. dollar.","GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.36 in the third quarter 2015. GAAP EPS includes the $0.04 benefit from the sale of tax credits I just mentioned. Our GAAP EPS also includes roughly $0.09 worth of acquisition and integration charges, $0.05 of which relates to the two acquisitions we closed in the third quarter. EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges, was $0.45 per share in Q3. This figure also includes the $0.04 benefit related to the sale of expiring tax credits.","If you recall, our third quarter EPS guidance, excluding acquisition and integration charges, was to be between $0.40 per share and $0.42 per share. If we exclude the $0.04 benefit from the sale of credits, our EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges, was $0.41 per share for the third quarter.","Turning now to cash, year to date operating cash flow decreased by 4% to $266 million, compared to this point last year largely due to a stronger U.S. dollar, higher acquisition-related incentive payments and higher cash taxes. We still expect to deliver free cash flow well in excess of net income yet again in 2015.","Share repurchases and strategic acquisitions are our primary uses of our free cash flow and available capital. First, let's cover acquisitions. In the third quarter, we spent $196 million net of cash acquired on two strategic acquisitions, U.S.-based Capterra and Barcelona-based Nubera, whose primary asset is GetApp. While the companies acquired are both small relative to our core business, they serve an important market need and are right in our sweet spot in terms of their value propositions, helping users of IT make better technology decisions. The two transactions also complement the Software Advice deal from last year. I'd also note that we utilized overseas cash for the Nubera acquisition.","These two deals were structured with additional cash consideration payable related to the ongoing employment of certain key executives and company bonus programs that will potentially be paid over the next three years. We'll recognize these additional cash payments as acquisition expense, and they will be amortized over the next two to three years. As with prior deals, these expenses will be excluded from our normalized EPS.","During the third quarter, we also utilized our cash to return value back to our shareholders through share repurchases. In the quarter we had share repurchases of $12 million. Year to date, we have repurchased $453 million of our shares.","We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position, including the acquisitions and share repurchases. As of September 30, we had gross debt of $840 million. We have $700 million of interest rate swaps in place, which effectively lock in our interest rates through September 2019 on this portion of our debt.","Our cash balance as of September 30, was $371 million, with 94% of our cash balance located outside of the U.S. The combination of our debt and cash positions represents a net debt position of $469 million.","Our current credit facility runs through 2019 and gives us ample liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive shareholder value. As of September 30, we had an additional $646 million of revolver capacity. We continue to look for other attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We also believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital. As of June 30, we had $1.18 billion available under our share repurchase authorization.","Turning now to guidance; based upon our year-to-date results, the impact of recent acquisitions, our outlook for Q4, and current foreign exchange rates, we are adjusting our outlook and also tightening the ranges of our previously issued guidance. As you know, our normal business trends do show seasonality. Our fourth quarter is typically our largest Events quarter, a large Consulting quarter, and our largest contract value growth quarter. All the figures that I'm going to go through are contained in our press release, but I wanted to provide color around the guidance ranges.","First, from a revenue perspective, we now expect the following annual revenue figures and corresponding FX-neutral growth rates. Research revenues of $1.580 billion to $1.595 billion, 15% to 16% annual growth, we modestly tightened the top end of guidance due to the stronger U.S. dollar against our major currencies. The impact of the stronger dollar was partially offset by the inclusion of our recently announced acquisitions.","Consulting revenues of $325 million to $340 million, negative 1% to positive 3% year-over-year growth; we've reduced the bottom end of guidance by $5 million and the top end by $10 million. Consulting guidance was impacted by foreign exchange and modestly by operational performance. Events revenues of $245 million to $255 million, 14% to 18% year-over-year growth; we are raising the bottom end of guidance by $5 million due to our over-performance in this segment, which is offsetting the drag from the FX rate.","On total revenues, there was no change to the bottom end and a $15 million tightening to the top end of prior guidance. Again, the (25:09 \u2013 25:15) to $2.190 billion or 12% to 14% annual growth on an FX-neutral basis. For EBITDA, we now expect to deliver between $405 million and $420 million for 2015, 11% to 15% growth on an FX-neutral basis. This reflects a $10 million tightening of the top end of our guidance. The stronger U.S. dollar was offset partially by the inclusion of our newly acquired businesses.","Like any multinational corporation, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to negatively impact our results and outlook on a reported basis. However, the FX-neutral growth rates are in line with our original guidance.","We are updating our GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the impacts from our Q3 acquisitions. We now expect GAAP EPS of between $1.97 per share and $2.07 per share. GAAP EPS now includes $0.32 per share of acquisition and integration charges, representing an increase of $0.16 per share for our two most recent acquisitions.","Earnings per share excluding acquisition and integration charges is expected to be $2.29 to $2.37 (26:31 \u2013 26:37) 9% to 13% FX-neutral growth. We have raised the bottom end of this guidance by $0.02 and tightened the top end down by $0.07. These adjustments reflect the impact of the tax credit sale and the inclusion of the acquired businesses, offset by the stronger U.S. dollar.","For cash flow, we are updating our guidance to reflect the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, higher acquisition charges, and higher levels of capital spending to support our growth. We now expect cash flow from operations of $337 million to $352 million, cash acquisition-related charges of $16 million, and gross capital expenditures of roughly $48 million. That yields a new free cash flow range of $305 million to $320 million, or $3.60 to $3.78 of free cash flow per share.","Again, the updates to our guidance are predominantly to reflect the impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar. Additionally, we've updated to account for the impacts from our two recent acquisitions. The FX-neutral growth rates for our business are in line with our previous guidance ranges.","In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Demand for our services is robust. And as a result, our Research contract value grew 14% and total revenue grew 13% at constant currency rates. Our key business metrics remain strong and are at or near all-time highs. We will continue to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions, and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program going forward. We move into Q4 with significant momentum and remain well-positioned to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth for the full year 2015.","Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. On the Research contract value growth, obviously, it continues to be broad-based growth, but there was a little bit of deceleration. Any pockets of weakness to call out, or what drove that?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Hey, Jeff, it's Gene. I wouldn't say it's pockets of weakness. I'd put it more in the category of noise. We had one country that I'll give you an example of that drove it. One of our countries was growing in the mid-30% year-over-year CV growth and it slowed to 20%. Another one \u2013 another region, larger than \u2013 both of these are large for us, was growing 40% and it slowed to 23%. And again I took those more as noise as opposed to there's some dramatic slowing.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it, that's helpful. And then on Consulting, is the weakness relative to plan all concentrated in CO or was labor-based also below plan?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Jeff. It's Craig. So in the quarter, it was predominantly contract optimization. That said, we were a little bit below our forecast on labor-based. And essentially, our strategy around adding managing partners is to drive deep long-lasting large consulting relationships with our clients. In the third quarter, we actually had two very large programs come to an end. And normally we're able to reassign all those consultants that are working those long dense engagements.","We had a little bit of a disruption here which impacted the labor-based revenue in the third quarter. That said, rolling forward, we had a really strong bookings quarter, and our backlog looks very strong for the labor-based business as well. So broadly speaking, contract optimization was the primary culprit. A little bit of softness on labor-based, but labor-based was more of a timing thing, and we feel good looking forward.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair & Co. Please proceed.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. I guess first just on the margins. I guess, you talked about productivity continuing to be strong on the Research side, I guess, but the updated guidance for this year just at a midpoint, we're basically looking at margins down 10 basis points. And so, I guess, one is when do you or when should we start to see the productivity flow through to the margin line, I guess?","And then secondarily, I guess, can you \u2013 I know you said it's seasonally stronger in the fourth quarter for margins, but the year-over-year improvement required is much better than you saw early in the year. So any timing factors, I guess, that give us reason to expect better margin improvement in the fourth quarter?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Tim. Good morning. On the first part of the question, the way that we look at it and the way to kind of think about it and model it through, we've seen a nice year-over-year improvements in productivity consistently for the last few quarters. That said, we're still growing head count at a faster rate than the productivity is turning into contract value growth. The reason we're doing that is because of that $58 billion market opportunity that we're going after. And so we're continuing to add head count to go after that market opportunity.","That said, when we bring on lots of new people and more people in their first year, et cetera, and we've had discussions around first-year productivity is significantly lower than second year productivity, which is lower than what it looks like once they're fully tenured, that's essentially what's causing that drag, if you will, on the margins.","That said, if you look at our guidance, again the midpoint may be 10 basis points down. The message from us is the guidance outlook calls for roughly flat margins. Maybe 10 basis points down, maybe flat, maybe 10 basis points up depending on how the quarter transpires from a reporting perspective, which has been consistent with what we've delivered over the last three years to four years.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I guess the comment on Q4 versus the \u2013 what we've seen so far this year. Is there a reason...","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. It's a great question. So as you'll recall, the first two quarters were really impacted by the grow-over related to our contract optimization business, which because of the size of the grow-over, actually caused a fairly big drag on the margins in the first half of the year and subsequently on the year-to-date numbers for the third quarter as well. In the fourth quarter we don't have that grow-over problem, and we typically have a very strong Events quarter, really strong contract value growth quarter, et cetera. That's why we're confident with the levels of growth required and the margin expansion required for the fourth quarter.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one for the model; the acquisitions you made, I know you said less than a point of contribution this quarter. But I guess I think that was probably a partial quarter. How should we think about the revenue and margin impact of those?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, it'll have a less than 2 point impact on the fourth quarter total revenue. So again, these are small acquisitions. And even less impact on EBITDA margins. Again, when we baked in the guidance, we baked it into the guidance. It's baked in there. It was offset by the stronger dollar, both on the revenue lines and on the EBITDA lines. But the way to think about it is less than 2% impact on total revenue in the fourth quarter.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Mark Wallach - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. This is actually Mark Wallach in for Anj. Thanks for taking my question. So diving a little deeper into an earlier question on the sales force productivity growth decelerating slightly, though off a tougher comp; so just looking at year ago, head count growth was slower \u2013 a little slower than usual. So I think that that would be a tailwind to productivity growth this quarter; so just wondering if you could give us some of the puts and takes there. And I guess along those lines, how should we think about the potential headwind on productivity going forward from accelerating head count growth?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So hey, Mark. On the productivity trend, again, down a little bit sequentially, but up nicely, up 5% on a year-over-year basis. And again, we look at it both ways. We actually think that year over year is a good way to look at it because it does take out some of the noise of movement and head count growth from quarter to quarter. So we're pleased with continued and consistent year-over-year improvements in sales productivity the way we measure it.","In terms of the grow-overs and the tailwind or headwind or however you want to describe it, the way to think about it is as we tick up or tick down, and again, we're within 2 points. So we're talking about 14% growth and 16% growth on a 2,000-person basis. You're talking about the difference of roughly 40 people one way or the other. So it's not a huge swing, even though it looks that way from a percentage basis. But as we tick up, we do have a slightly richer mix of new hires, which are inherently less productive. And so we're delivering 5% year-over-year productivity growth while having a richer mix of first-year AEs.","And again the way it works with us is the first-year AEs, it really is an investment because they are lower productivity. But then as they rise in tenure, they really start to drive significant growth and as it rolls through the system. So that's the way we think about the productivity and the growth.","The second question was around future headwinds. I don't know, Gene, if you want to tackle that one. I mean...","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I mean basically, Mark, we're committed to continually improving our recruiting, continually improving our training, giving our sales force new tools, as we've talked about. And we think over time those things will enhance sales productivity, which is why we're doing it. And so we're on a strong drive to improve our sales productivity over time. So instead of headwinds, I think the opposite, which is that because of the changes we're making, we expect that sales productivity will improve over time.","Mark Wallach - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. That's helpful, and then just another quick one. In Consulting, we saw the decline in average annualized revenue per billable head count accelerate slightly. So can you just help us understand what's happening there and how we should think about that going forward? Is that just a function of additional MPs versus the RAM time, et cetera, or is there something more there?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So the way to look at that one, Mark, is more than half of the decline is actually foreign exchange. We do have a very healthy business, particularly over in Europe with our Consulting. And so with the euro and the pound doing what it's done, that's obviously having the most significant impact. Beyond that, there are really two primary factors. One is a slight downtick in utilization. We were at 63% on the quarter, down about 2 points from last year. That obviously impacts the annualized revenue per billable. And again, that's more related to what I described earlier around some of those larger projects coming to an end and us not getting those consultants reassigned on new projects right away, which they are now.","The second biggest factor, which has actually been a strategic focus for us as well, is while we're accelerating the growth of our managing partners, the top of the pyramid, we've actually been very aggressive about filling in the bottom of the pyramid as well, so the more junior level consultants that are actually on the ground delivering the hunk of the value. If you look at roughly 60% of the decline from foreign exchange, another 20% from the lower utilization rate, the balance is actually from a shift in mix. So we've got significantly more lower-level consultants, who we actually make great margins on out there billing, which drags down the bill rate a little bit, but it's actually very healthy for margins.","Mark Wallach - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please proceed.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to touch on the acquisitions a bit. I mean it sounds like minimal impact to revenue and EBITDA, but the $196 million net of cash acquired price seems a little high. So I was just wondering if you could give us some color on the size of those assets individually. And also I think you mentioned that the incentive payments to the management of those guys over the years would be recognized as an acquisition expense and excludes amortization. I'm just wondering why, if that's just (40:27).","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Manav. So as you know, we've traditionally targeted companies that had at least $10 million in IT spending, and there's, we've estimated, 110,000 of those companies. There are tens of millions of smaller businesses. And these three businesses, two of which we acquired this quarter, in addition to Software Advice, those three businesses provide the same kind of services that we provide to larger companies to these tens of millions of smaller companies. And the reason we did these acquisitions obviously wasn't for this quarter or even next year. But we think over the next five years that this will be a great growth business for us. And it fits very well with what we do as a business, which is we've always, our specialty is advising clients on what products and services to buy and how to get the most out of their technology investments.","I don't know if, Craig, you wanted to step in.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Manav, just on the accounting side of it, we had the same accounting treatment related to the Software Advice deal where there were what we'll call hold-backs for the management team that they have to earn by being onboard and contributing to the business over a couple-year period. When we structured the deals, they are akin to consideration. However, from a GAAP accounting perspective, we treat them as operating expense. And because it is really in our mind more or like consideration for the acquisition, that's why we normalize it out from an expense perspective on a go-forward basis.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just to touch on, since most of your cash is now overseas, is there any inherent limitation there in terms of either buying domestic companies, or I guess you just have to use your revolver to do buybacks. I'm just wondering if we should think of that as a limitation by any means.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, the overseas cash balance obviously cannot be utilized for every business initiative or shareholder enhancing initiative we want to undertake. That said, with the Nubera acquisition as an example, we were actually able to use that foreign cash to do the acquisition. On a go-forward basis, the combination of that cash overseas, the great free cash flow generation we have both here and overseas, plus the $646 million available on our current revolver, and on top of that we actually have a $500 million expansion feature in our credit facility. We feel like the combination of those three or four things allow us to be well-positioned to pursue whatever shareholder enhancing initiatives we want to.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. How are your discussions going with clients as they plan their 2016 budgets? And have you seen any change in tone as the year has gone on?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. It's Gene. No, actually basically as clients are planning their 2016 budgets, they've been focused on the same issues. They've been focused on what we're calling bimodal IT, which is building up things for the digital economy at the same time keeping their existing business running. They're worried about cybersecurity and having to deal with cybersecurity. So those are the kinds of things that they're focused on, and it hasn't changed through the year.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And just given the two new acquisitions in the small and medium-sized space, I'm just wondering if you could talk about the initial receptivity among clients in that area. Especially, you've had Software Advice for a little while now. So I just wanted to get your sense of how big the opportunity could be and just how the reaction is going to your bulking up in that area. Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the small companies have the same kind of problems with IT that big companies do. And these companies that we're targeting actually in general do not have an IT department. Things like think about a small funeral home or an electrician. An electrician has four or five electricians that work for them, or someone like that. There are huge opportunities for them to use IT in their business. And the changes in technology have made it so that there are more and more opportunities every day. Things like Amazon Web Services and all of the software tools that are available now, particularly open-source tools.","So there's an explosion of innovation in software, particularly hosted software that applies to these small businesses. These small businesses, they're not experts in IT and they need help figuring out what's best for their particular business in their particular situation. And so the receptivity to \u2013 and that's what these three businesses we've bought do. And the clients love them because they need the help to figure out these tough IT decisions just like large companies, except they don't have an IT department.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just lastly, is this more of \u2013 are these businesses more transactional than like a typical research subscription model that you have in a larger business?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, they are more transactional as opposed to a subscription model.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, good morning. This is actually Steven (46:03) filling in for Peter Appert. I have a question in regards to the Events segment. The Events business has been a very strong performer in Q3 and for the past quarter. How big is the opportunity here, and what drives the continuing growth?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, it's Gene. So our Events business has been seeing enormous opportunity that we have in all of our Research business. Basically we have opportunities on two dimensions of our Events business. The first is to grow -the existing Events portfolio we have has lots of room for growth. We don't see any of the event types that we have today having any growth restrictions.","In addition to that, there will be new events we can add as well. For example, over time I expect we are going to add more Symposium events around the world. And so we've got both growth from our existing events which we think is unconstrained for the foreseeable future, and then adding whole new events, particularly in geographies where we don't have all of the events today.","Unknown Speaker","I see. And in terms of the macro economy in Europe, it remains challenging. Can you elaborate what are you seeing in major markets?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So as I mentioned before, in every geography and every industry, we've had double digit growth again. And so even when the economic situation is tough, people have IT problems; IT is often one of the solutions to those problems. And we're the best source to go to. And so, we see robust growth in every geography and every industry around the world.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, great. That's all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of questions, Craig, I'll start with something you said. I think I heard you saying new business was up 8%. Is that a bookings number? I don't remember, and if so, I don't remember you consistently providing that in the past. What's the context we should put around that? That's quite a bit below contract value growth. Is there something that that's indicative of?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Gary. No. It's actually something that we do provide generally each quarter. It's not the bookings number. It's actually exclusive of the renewal activity. So it's essentially the growth bookings that we have each quarter, and again, can vary from quarter to quarter a little bit in terms of how much we're actually renewing and how much we're actually selling in terms of growth. As you'd imagine, Q4, it tends to be by far our largest growth quarter. And we feel good where we are from a new business perspective, both for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So the way to think about that is 8% is the new bookings? Then you've got on the renewal base some pricing and likely some people buying more than they did a year ago. You add that all up, you get to 14%? Is that the right way to think about it?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, no. The 8% is actually it's a year-over-year growth measure. So it's not a proportion of the current year bookings. It's the year-over-year growth.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, all right. And then just on events; having recently been at your event in Florida, it seems to be bigger and grander every year. Is there a risk with events like that that they just get too big for their own good? And I guess I ask from the perspective of if you had 9% growth in same-event attendees, but 22% revenue, I realize there's some pricing, but it seems like you're also getting outsized growth from the exhibitors. Is there some point at which the benefit to them declines as you jam more of them in there or raise the price? Or do you think we're not anywhere near that given the value you're providing to them?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, there's another factor going on, Gary, which is that we're shifting the mix to sell to more senior people. And so if you look at like the event you went to, the proportion of people that are CIOs there has been growing at a very high rate. And that's purposeful. That's by design. Symposium is targeted at CIOs and that level of leaders. And so we're increasing the mix of senior people. And as we target more senior people, the pricing is higher as well. We changed the event to be targeted at senior people. We invite more of them, and the pricing goes along with it. And so, it's not just the exhibitor piece. There's actually a mix shift going on where we've been targeting more senior people who, frankly, it's part of a broader strategy which they have decision-making \u2013 more decision-making authority in their organizations. And so they come to our event to understand Gartner. It's good for our entire business.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you, thanks. And then just a cleanup one on the FX; I know you've talked about 40% or 50% of revenue being overseas. But can you just give us an update? What's the general mix of euro and pound, which after next quarter are a lot less of the drag? But versus the Canadian dollar, EM and Aussie dollar, which really weaken quite a bit and probably remain a drag for several quarters into next year?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So, Gary, we haven't got into real great detail there. What I'll tell you is euro and pound are by far the two largest exposures we have globally. But that said, we've got a great business in Canada, a great business in Australia and a great business in Brazil that have been growing consistently and rapidly over the last several years. And so while they're not nearly as big as the euro or pound, they are in that top five or six currency exposures for us. So they do have an impact, as you mentioned. I mean the euro and the pound, and maybe this is a little bit of a hopeful comment, have mostly stabilized for the most part. I mean the euro is still down 3%-ish from when we gave our initial guidance. But the Brazilian real is down 50% since we gave our initial guidance.","So the good news is the two larger currencies have mostly stabilized. But these other currencies are big enough businesses for us that they do move the needle a little bit. We'll continue to focus in on how we're doing from an FX-neutral perspective, and provide all the transparency possible so that you can see what's actually happening underneath the covers. But you're right on the euro and pound perspective. It should look a little bit better on a reported basis rolling forward.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But the right assumption probably at this point, given what you've told us, is there's likely to be a noticeable if not material drag in the first half of 2016, just based on these ones that have really started weakening recently.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","On a reported basis, that is true. On an FX-neutral basis, we'd expect to continue the way we've been going.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO. Please go ahead.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. It's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. I just had a question on the planned sales force increase. I don't know if you'd be able to quantify this at all. But I was curious to know how long, given the trends in sales force productivity and the gains you're seeing in enterprise contract value; I was just wondering if you might be able to give us a sense of when sales force trends, we should see an impact on revenue growth?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Henry, the way we think about it and again the contract value growth feeds the revenue growth. And so with our sales productivity gains, we're in that 14% to 15% revenue growth range. If you recall, go back several quarters, we had lower productivity and we were delivering 12%, 13% contract value growth. The gains we had last year and into this year have allowed us to be delivering 15% \u2013 14% to 15% CV growth and 14% to 15% Research revenue growth.","On a go-forward basis, as we stated, we are very focused on continuing to improve productivity and continuing to grow the sales force. The combination of those two things will convert into higher levels of contract value growth and then subsequently higher levels of Research revenue growth.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, got it. I mean is there a lag time that is different from that we've seen in prior quarters, or is it...","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, the historical lag, if you will, between contract value conversion to revenue conversion is consistent with what we've always seen.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And how much of your sales force growth is related to growing the small-size to medium-size opportunity that you're seeing?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Henry, the businesses that we just acquired and Software Advice, we wouldn't include in that group. And so we handle those separately because they handle it in a different way. And so the sales force increase is, that we talked about, is in our traditional business where we're targeting those 110,000 companies. And within that, there are large, medium and smaller businesses but they're all above the size of the acquisitions.","And directionally it's kind of the same split. We have \u2013 we're still investing in large companies. We're still investing in small companies and medium-sized companies in that original 110,000 base.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much indeed for your questions, ladies and gentlemen. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Gene Hall for the closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I thank all of you for joining us today. To summarize the key points of today's call, we are doing great as a company and our underlying metrics are strong. We continue to invest to improve recruiting capability, training tools that drive sales productivity over time. We once again delivered double digit growth in every region across every client size and in every industry segment.","We remain committed to enhancing shareholder value through investment in our business, strategic acquisitions, and share repurchases.

With me today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer. This call will include a discussion of third quarter 2019 financial results and our current outlook for 2019 as disclosed in today's press release. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a detailed review of our financials and business metrics and earnings supplement for investors and analysts.

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.","Gene Hall","Good morning. Thanks for joining us. For the third quarter 2019, we continued to deliver strong performances across our business. Total revenues were up 11% fueled by double-digit growth in each of our business segments: Research, Conferences and Consulting. We continue to make a significant global impact through these segments. We help more than 15,000 enterprise clients in more than 100 countries around the world with their mission-critical priorities, while providing great jobs to more than 16,000 associates globally.","Research, our largest and most profitable segment, is the core of our value proposition. Our Research business was up 10% over this time last year. The Gartner formula for sustained double-digit growth continues to drive success in our Research business. As we previously highlighted, the Gartner formula consists of indispensable insights, exceptional talent, sales excellence and enabling infrastructure. For each of these elements, we drive relentless, globally consistent execution of best practices and consistent improvement and innovation.","Global Technology Sales or GTS serves leaders and their teams within IT. This group represents more than 80% of our total Research contract value. GTS contract value growth was 13% year-over-year. We delivered double-digit growth in every region, across every size company and in virtually every industry. Global Business Sales or GBS serves leaders and their teams beyond IT and represents about 20% of our total Research contract value. This includes supply chain and marketing, which we have addressed for several years, as well as other major enterprise roles, including HR, finance, legal sales and more.","GBS continued on a path toward double-digit growth with total GBS contract value accelerating to 3%. Our GxL product line continued to gain momentum, with contract value increasing $26 million sequentially. GxL products provide greater value to clients because they are tailored to the client's individual needs. This in turn results in higher prices per user and stronger retention. Beyond better pricing retention, GxL products provide exponentially more growth opportunities because we can sell these high-value products throughout our client's organizations.","For Q3, GxL contract value grew 65% year-over-year and new business was up 39%. We expect continued acceleration in GBS contract value. In Q4, if new business growth and retention improvement is the same as it was in Q3, contract value growth will be 9.6%. Our Conferences segment also delivered a terrific performance in Q2 with double-digit revenue growth of 19%. Gartner Conferences combine the outstanding value of research with the immersive experience of live interactions, making every conference we produce the most important gathering for the executives we serve.","I recently attended our IT Symposium Conference in Orlando, Florida. This conference is the most important gathering of CIOs and Senior IT Executives in North America. We hosted around 8,000 attendees on site and about 3,000 of these were Chief Information Officers. This is near all-time highs.","At our conferences, you can see firsthand the power of Gartner in helping clients achieve their mission-critical priorities. Clients received incredible insights from our analysts. They networked with leading peers and experienced leading edge technology for the most important providers in the world.","Our executive attendees were inspired and empowered to succeed as a result of the insights we delivered at this important event. Our associates were equally inspired and excited about the incredible value we deliver to our clients.","Our Consulting segment also achieved double-digit growth in Q2 with revenues up 20%. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and provides clients a deeper level of involvement through extended project-based work to help them execute their most strategic initiatives. Our growth in the quarter was a combination of our labor-based business and strength in our Contract Optimization business.","So, we delivered another strong quarter across all three of our business segments. We continue to have a vast market opportunity. We've made investments over the past two years that position us well to capture that market opportunity. We're preparing our 2020 business plan and expect to continue attractive double-digit growth.","We plan to maintain expense growth in line with revenue growth by leveraging investments we've made over the past three years. Specifically, we expect total expense growth to be in line with total revenue growth. We've had a strong history of continuous improvement and continuous innovation. We're shifting the emphasis of our innovations and improvements to be on more tightly managing expenses.","Sales is one of our largest expense categories. In sales, we'll be implementing significant innovations that we expect will improve sales expenses relative to contract value.","Here are three examples. Territory design is an important factor in determining a salesperson's productivity, especially in a growth company. We've developed a highly sophisticated territory planning capability over the past few years. For 2020, we're making a major advance by making the territory planning process much more dynamic.","Another important factor impacting sales expenses is how quickly new sales hires get into the territory and make their first sale. Over the past few years, we developed a very strong recruiting capability. For 2020, we're implementing changes to the recruiting process which will allow us to put salespeople in territory just in time, analogous to just-in-time manufacturing.","A third factor impacting sales expenses is training. Over the past few years we developed sales training that is broadly recognized as being outstanding. For our next evolution, we're reducing the amount of upfront training and shifting this training to be just-in-time as a salesperson needs it. This will enable us to be even more effective, while getting salespeople into territory even faster.","Beyond sales, we expect to get leverage from the G&A investments we've made over the past few years. We've already begun making these changes to ensure we get the full impact in our 2020 plan.","Summarizing, we're shifting to getting returns from the investments we've made over the past three years, while maintaining the long-term growth that captures our enormous market opportunity.","Looking ahead, we are well-positioned for sustained long-term growth. We expect continued sustained long-term growth in GTS. We expect continued acceleration in GBS and Conferences and Consulting are on a strong path.","Looking ahead to 2020 with the great strategic positioning of GTS and GBS together with leveraging the investments we've made, we expect double-digit topline growth and EBITDA growing approximately in line with revenues.","With that I'll hand the call over to Craig.","Craig Safian","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Global Technology Sales, the largest part of our business continues to deliver strong double-digit growth. Global Business Sales continued to accelerate after inflecting to growth last quarter.","Our strategy to deliver products and services with the compelling value proposition across all enterprise functions is working. Conferences and Consulting are having outstanding years.","Third quarter revenue was $1 billion, up 10% as reported and 11% on an FX-neutral basis. Topline growth was impacted by about 100 basis points in the quarter from the product retirements we've previously discussed.","In addition, contribution margin was 64% down 10 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA was $140 million, ahead of expectations, although down 6% year-over-year and 5% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $0.70 and free cash flow in the quarter was $190 million.","Our Research business had a strong quarter. Research revenue grew 9% year-over-year in the third quarter and 10% on an FX-neutral basis. Third quarter contribution margin was 69%. Total contract value was $3.3 billion at September 30th, growth of 11% versus the prior year. We always report contract value growth in FX-neutral terms.","I'll now review the details of our performance for both GTS and GBS. In the third quarter, GTS contract value increased 13% versus the prior year. GTS had contract value of $2.6 billion on September 30, representing just over 80% of our total contract value. Client retention for GTS remained strong at 82%.","Wallet retention for GTS was 105% for the quarter, down 16 basis points year-over-year. Our wallet retention rates show that our clients spend more with us each and every year because of the value we provide to them. GTS new business grew 12% versus the third quarter of last year, a strong rebound from second quarter. New businesses coming from a mix of new enterprises and growth in existing enterprises through sales of additional services and upgrades.","We ended the third quarter with 12,728 GTS enterprises, up 2% compared to Q3 2018. We've added over 1,600 new enterprises so far in 2019. The majority of client losses are with our smaller, lower spending clients, which you can see in the client retention rates.","Moving forward, we expect to grow the number of enterprises as well as expanding the contract value in those enterprises. The average contract value per enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at $208,000 per enterprise in GTS, up 11% year-over-year. Growth in CV per enterprise reflects both price increases as well as upsell and increased numbers of subscriptions.","At the end of the third quarter, we had 3,355 quota-bearing associates in GTS, a growth of 14% year-over-year. We have made investments in the GTS sales force and have seen CV accelerate from 2017. Following the additions we made late last year and early this year, we are recalibrating our expense growth to ensure we align it with GTS CV growth. These changes are consistent with our continuing commitment to strong execution and sustained long-term double-digit growth.","We expect GTS headcount growth to end 2019 at approximately 10%. With the hiring we've done, the sales force has the capacity to grow GTS contract value between 12% and 16% per year, consistent with our medium-term guidance. For GTS, the year-over-year net contract value increase or NCVI divided by the beginning period quota-bearing headcount was $104,000 per salesperson, down 4% versus the third quarter of last year.","The higher headcount growth late last year and into this year brought down the average tenure as new salespeople take time to get the full productivity. One of the benefits of moderating the headcount growth exiting this year and moving into 2020 is that average tenure will increase, which should improve productivity.","Turning to Global Business Sales. GBS contract value was $620 million at the end of the third quarter or about 20% of our total contract value. The momentum we saw last quarter continued, with GBS CV increasing 3% year-over-year. The acceleration in GBS contract value was driven by strength in GxL. Total GBS new business was up 26% and retention improved as well. GxL products are an important part of our strategy and continue to gain share.","Looking at total contract value from the GxL products, we drove an FX-neutral increase of 65% year-over-year from $154 million to $254 million. We've updated the GxL data we provided the last few quarters on Page 11 of the earnings supplement to highlight the trend in GxL new business and contract value. We sold $35 million of GxL new business in Q3, up 39% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to make great progress with our GxL products across each of the functions GBS serves.","More than half of the GxL new business in the quarter came from newly launched products. GxL CV now makes up 41% of our total GBS contract value, up 15 percentage points from Q3 of last year. We're driving increased client engagement through expanded service teams and growing adoption of individualized content and service. For the standalone of quarter, we drove attrition rate down for GBS.","For contracts that were up for renewal in the third quarter, attrition improved by about 500 basis points over the prior year quarter. Again, this is a result of the increased engagement we've discussed, a richer mix of GxL renewals and all of our other retention programs having an impact. Our path to continued acceleration and double-digit growth for GBS is clear.","As Gene detailed, the path to double-digit growth is based on new business growth and attrition improvement consistent with Q3. At the end of the third quarter, we had 910 quota-bearing associates in GBS or growth of 19%. Headcount was down sequentially as we are recalibrating our cost base. We expect GBS headcount growth to moderate by the end of the year as we shift to reap the benefits of the investments we've made.","In conferences, revenues increased by 16% year-over-year in Q3 to $66 million. FX-neutral growth was 19%. Third quarter contribution margin was 41%, down 239 basis points from an especially strong third quarter 2018. The largest impact on the year-over-year Q3 contribution margin comparison was the movement of our Europe supply chain conference into Q2. On a year-to-date basis, conferences contribution margin was flat compared to the prior year.","We had 18 destination conferences in the third quarter. On a same conference FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 20% with a 9% increase in attendees and a 100 basis point improvement from same conference contribution margin.","Turning to Consulting. Third quarter Consulting revenues increased by 18% year-over-year to $93 million. FX-neutral growth was 20%. Consulting contribution margin was 28% in the third quarter.","Labor-based revenues were $78 million, up 11% versus Q3 of last year or 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor based billable headcount of 809 was up 11%. Utilization was 57% as the third quarter is our seasonally lowest utilization quarter and also when our annual MBA hires join the company.","Backlog at September 30th was $109 million, up 3% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about 4.5 months of forward revenue coverage in line with our operating targets.","Contract Optimization revenues were up 74% versus the prior year quarter. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. The compares get significantly more challenging in the fourth quarter.","SG&A increased 15% year-over-year in the third quarter and 17% on an FX-neutral basis. We will continue to grow sales capacity and the enabling infrastructure to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long-term. We have started the process to recalibrate the sales and infrastructure investment to align cost growth with revenue growth.","EBITDA for the third quarter was $140 million, down 6% year-over-year on a reported basis and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. In the third quarter this year, EBITDA was adversely affected by about four percentage points or $5 million impact due to the product retirements we have discussed. Taking that into consideration, underlying FX-neutral EBITDA was down about 2% in the quarter.","Depreciation was up about $3 million from last year as additional office space went into service. Amortization was flat sequentially. Integration expenses were down year-over-year as we have moved past the biggest part of the integration work.","During the quarter, we recognized an unrealized gain of $9.1 million related to a minority equity investment that we sold in October. The gain is in other income. This was a heritage CEB minority investment in a small company, which was acquired.","Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $22 million, down from $25 million in the third quarter of 2018. Our lower net interest expense resulted from lower average debt balances of roughly $170 million. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 22.8% for the quarter, lower than expected as a result of more favorable income mix and timing of reserve movements. The tax rate for the items to adjust net income was 24.2% in the quarter.","Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $0.70, above our expectations due to operating upside and a lower tax rate. In Q3, operating cash flow was $220 million, compared to $249 million last year. The decrease in operating cash flow is primarily driven by lower EBITDA.","Q3 2019 CapEx was $36 million and Q3 acquisition and integration payments and other non-recurring items was approximately $7 million. This yields Q3 free cash flow of $190 million, which is down 17% versus the prior year quarter, normalizing 2018 for divestitures and working capital timing.","On a rolling four quarter basis, our free cash flow conversion was 119% of adjusted net income, excluding divested operations and working capital timing. The lower conversion is due to timing and we expect to finish the year with the conversion rate in the high 120s.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our September 30th debt balance was about $2.2 billion. Our debt is effectively 100% fixed rate. Adjusting EBITDA for the divestitures, our gross leverage ratio is now about 3.3 times EBITDA. We repurchased $95 million of stock in the quarter at an average price of about $134 per share. We will continue to be price sensitive and opportunistic as we return capital to shareholders. We have $777 million remaining on our repurchase authorization.","Our capital allocation strategy remained the same. We deployed our free cash flow and balance sheet flexibility by returning capital to our shareholders through our buyback programs and through strategic value enhancing M&A.","Earlier this month, we acquired TOPO, a provider of insight and advice for sales leaders. The overall purchase price was $33 million with a portion of the consideration deferred for a couple of years.","Turning to the outlook for 2019. Revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS guidance all remain unchanged from last quarter. The top line growth outlook on an FX-neutral basis remain strong and we are committed to the same second half targets we provided in July. As you're thinking about the fourth quarter in the context of third quarter results there are two points to keep in mind.","First Consulting outperformed our expectations in the quarter in both labor-based and Contract Optimization. Most of the upside was revenue we previously forecasted for the fourth quarter. And second, as we began the process to realign our expense growth with our revenue, we shifted some cost out of Q3 and into Q4.","Our guidance reflects FX rates as of September 30. FX is causing a roughly two point negative impact to a projected 2019 full year growth rates across revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. The highlights of our full year guidance are as follows: We expect FX-neutral revenue growth of 10% to 11%; we expect adjusted EBITDA in FX-neutral terms of down 1% to up 4%; we expect an adjusted tax rate of around 25.5% for 2019 that implies a mid-50% rate for the fourth quarter; our tax planning related to our intellectual property is ongoing and we anticipate incremental tax costs in the fourth quarter.","Please note that, if you are adding back from GAAP net income the rate for the tax effect on the add-backs is also about 25.5%. For 2019, we expect free cash flow of $400 million to $430 million. That is a projected FX-neutral change of down 2% to up 5% versus our normalized 2018 free cash flow. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.","In summary, GTS contract value growth continues to be strong and sales of our new GxL products and GBS continue to rise. Our Conferences and Consulting businesses both had great quarters. We expect to finish the year with free cash flow conversion from net income in the high 120 percents. As we prepare for 2020, we are actively recalibrating our investments to ensure cost growth is in line with revenue growth. And we continue to apply the Gartner formula across the combined business to drive sustained long-term double-digit growth to revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Meuler","Yeah. Thank you. To start, can you just give some more color on the improved GTS new business sold trend. And I guess, what I'm wondering if last quarter you talked about an abnormal amount of management or operational change and that had some impact. I'm just curious, does it tie back to those regions or just anything you can say about the improved GTS new business sold trend?","Gene Hall","Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the question. I think our new business performance obviously we want to drive consistent double-digit improvements in our new business on a year-over-year basis. We got back on track for that trend in the third quarter with strong new business growth. I think that the challenges we detailed last quarter, we are working our way through them. It takes time to work through them.","So I would definitely not attribute the rebound to \u2013 those things all bounce back. But I just attribute it to: one, we have a huge market opportunity which we continue to go after; two, we've continued to grow our sales force to go after that opportunity; and three we have an expectation that we'll drive double-digit growth in our new business to basically support or sustain double-digit growth within GTS.","Jeff Meuler","Okay. And then on the way that you're managing expenses and margin I know, it's being well received from your shareholders base, but I guess just want to make sure that the way you're managing it doesn't ultimately impact growth. And I hear you on the GBS sales headcount that you've kind of already made the investment and it's time to harvest that. But the other things that you're citing, they sound to me like kind of the continual improvements that Gartner is always making. So am I wrong about that? Is there some reason why we should think that those productivity impacts will be bigger from this round of initiatives? Or are there other areas other than kind of harvesting GBS sales headcount where you're actually reducing spend or not making investments that you otherwise would have made?","Gene Hall","Hey, Jeff, it's Gene. I put it in two categories. One is \u2013 or three categories, I'm sorry, three categories. One is sort of in GBS where again, as you correctly articulated we made some major investments since we acquired CEB. We're seeing those returns on those investments, we're very focused and making sure we get those returns to the investment. We've got the sales force trained and we got the products introduced. And so now we want to make sure we focus on getting returns from that, and so we see a big upside there. Secondly, in GTS similarly we've made \u2013 in GTS similarly we made some investments over the last year \u2013 during that same period of time, and we invested a little higher rate than we had invested even before this CEB acquisition. And we have a similar situation just not as pronounced as it was on the GBS side.","And some of the changes involve some innovations like -- I took you through three of them and we think are material innovations that will affect in particular, the expense relative to contract value which is really important in sales.","And the last thing I also mentioned which is, we do think that there is some leverage we can get out of our G&A that we haven't gotten over the last couple of years. And I'll give you an example which is as we grew we had some major real estate projects. Those projects are now at a point where we can start getting the benefits from those and so we have less of a drag in G&A from those, which is part of the reason we can expect, as I said G&A to grow slower than our overall revenues going forward.","Jeff Meuler","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more around the client count reduction. It's been three quarters now. I know you said most of it was on the small business side, but that's usually the case.","So I was just wondering is there anything incremental. And your confidence in growing that again are you going to shift strategy to more larger accounts or if there's any change there at all?","Craig Safian","Good morning, Manav. And thanks for the question. I think on the enterprise account thing -- or the enterprise account trend I should say, there are a few things going on there. One is; as we have talked about in the past, any M&A obviously won't impact that count and we have been in a period where there's been more M&A than normal and that has a modest impact on the count.","And the second piece which we talked about last quarter was, we're continually refreshing and updating our data sources and that does and has over the last three or four quarters impacted the enterprise count a little bit to the negative as we've cleaned up data and consolidated certain enterprises; again, another modest impact.","The third thing I'd say is, which I alluded to in the prepared remarks, we're continuing to add new enterprises at a very strong clip in GTS. As I mentioned through the first three quarters, we've added over 1600 gross new enterprises. You will note a modest uptick or downtick I should say in our client retention rate.","And essentially you're not seeing the increases you've historically seen in our enterprise count because of the cleanup and because of the small downtick in the client retention rate.","Going forward, I don't think there's any change in the strategy. It's not about going after larger companies. The note I'd make around the really small companies and small tech companies in particular is, we have a different strategy around how we're attacking them.","The bulk of our market is really not them and so, we want to make sure that we handle that bit of the business in a more efficient, more effective, and more profitable manner. But the market opportunity remains really, really, really vast and we'll continue to go after that opportunity by adding new salespeople and by growing the enterprise count over the long term.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, got it. And Gene just to follow-up on your last comment there around seeing the returns in a lot of your investments and making sure you see more. I guess how will we see it? Like shouldn't we also see some of that with some signs of improved margins, given the heavy investment? Or is that maybe two years out which is why you guided to flat margins for next year?","Craig Safian","Hey, Manav, I'll jump in. You mentioned margin so Gene looked over to me. So I think the way to think about it is, I think you're right. So two things; one is, we're not providing 2020 guidance yet. We're working our 2020 operating plan as we speak and we'll give you and all of our investors the details of that plan in early February.","Two, I do think there is time that takes to actually see those benefits flow through especially given the routable nature of the bulk of our revenues. And so what Gene stated and which I affirmed is, we believe for 2020 revenues and expenses and EBITDA will grow roughly in line with one another.","And in my mind that's the first step towards seeing the real benefits of all the investments we've put in place.","Manav Patnaik","All right. Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Gary Bisbee","Hey guys, good morning. As Gene -- I guess the first question for you on the sales changes that you mentioned can you just give us a little more color? I've always thought your sales turning was a key part of your long-term success. So reducing that upfront more I guess you said just in time as you go, what does that really mean?","And is there any productivity risk around that in similar concept on the recruiting process changes or even the new way you're managing territories? What's the risk to those strategy?","Gene Hall","So let me just -- I mean there's clearly risk in anything you do, but we think these are actually -- have a lot of upside to it. And let me just take for example the training piece. So the way we have traditionally trained is, we'll bring a new person on and depending what role they're in and what geography they're in the training is six to eight weeks long and it's really good training. We have -- it really gives them a lot of tools.","What we found is after getting training for a couple of weeks, the kind of retention of what they've learned isn't as high as you'd like. And so we've come up with what we think is our big innovation there, which is shortening the upfront training to approximately -- again, it will vary, they call it approximately two weeks. And then delivering the others -- other training, as they're in -- throughout their first year, but when they need it.","So for example, you might have a training session on how to handle client objections for a particular product. If you get the training upfront well, it's much more applicable, if they're about to talk to a client about that particular product to get their firm hand on how to handle objections, the day before as opposed to three months beforehand where they -- the retention that there -- what they remember about what they were told is a lot lower.","And so the way to think about it is, they're going to get the same amount of training, but this is actually a much more effective way to do it, because we give them the bases what they need upfront. And then each week they would get a booster on the specific things they need to address the challenges, they have there with their client base that particular week.","And so the total training we are not thinking of is less, it's just a smarter way to do it, where they get it where they can really use it. Any studies that you read and our experience is the same, which is, if you get trained the day -- if the salesperson gets trained the day before they have to actually use it, they pay higher a lot attention than if its the fifth week of six weeks of training for something they're going to use in nine months, if you're with me.","And so the way to think about it is, same training, just much more effectively delivered. It also happens to help our cost structure, because then we have people into territories sooner. And so instead of going to territory after six or eight weeks, they're going to territory after two weeks, and so they actually start learning their client base and get to that first sale faster, which gives them a lot of confidence.","Gary Bisbee","Great. That's helpful. And then Craig just one for you. When you talked about free cash flow, I think I heard you say ex the divestiture's fine. But could you also say when you're talking about conversion ex working capital movements. And if so, two part or are you changing how you talk about cash flow conversion, number one? Number two, is there anything about the working capital characteristic particularly now that you've got CV growing at GBS that we should think it's different than what it's been in the past?","Craig Safian","Good morning, Gary. Good question. So the working capital timing adjustment that we've discussed relates to the catch-up where we got behind at the end of 2017, which we talked about which really impacted 2017 free cash flow. At the time, we said it was about a $40 million impact of free cash flows, because we had challenges in the integration with getting the invoices out about $40 million of 2017 free cash flow split into 2018.","And so when we talk about the adjustment -- the \"adjustment\" for working capital timing, that's splitting that $40 million back in 2017 when we do the year-over-year comparison to get a better view on what the true organic growth rate is in free cash flow.","And then on the second part of your question, no change to the working capital characteristics of the company. We remain really focused on making sure that we leverage and get the benefits out of the negative working capital characteristics of our Research businesses. We're very, very, very focused on that, as we've discussed in the past and as you alluded to.","As GBS contract value accelerates, that clearly is a benefit on those negative working capital components, because as that business is growing faster, we could take more advantage of it.","And the third thing, I'd say is, we remain very focused on improving the efficiency of our working capital as well. And so I think as we roll forward, we would expect to see us continue to get the benefits, perhaps even get more benefits out of the fundamentals of our working capital model as we grow both GTS CV and GBS CV.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks very much. Craig you mentioned the two main reasons for keeping the guidance you see in Consulting and the expenses shifting into Q4. Would you say there is similar conservatism in the guidance than last quarter? And are there any incremental factors that you're seeing that are maybe a little bit less good and that's the reason you're keeping it the same?","Craig Safian","Yeah. Hey, good morning Toni. Thanks for the question. I think the way to think about the guidance is when we came out of Q2 and with our adjustments there, we were very focused on delivering what we committed to over the second half of 2019. And as we rolled through Q3, I'd say, again, the three -- the two things I mentioned on the call most notably, the timing around Consulting and deferral of certain expenses into -- from Q3 into Q4 certainly were the largest impacts.","You might argue we were a little conservative in the Q3 number, when we came out with it, but I would not imply huge overarching conservatism over our second half target, which we remain committed to.","Toni Kaplan","Okay. Great. And then I wanted to ask about Conferences. I think I probably hadn't appreciated the link between Conferences and Research sales as much as I should have. And so can you just talk about how the GBS Conferences have been going? And I guess if there's any way to quantify how much benefit you normally get from a conference translating into Research sales later on? And anything in terms of improvement with Evanta, that would be great? Thank you.","Gene Hall","So, our Conferences are a great business and it's a great way to leverage our Research, where we do research on a particular topic. Obviously, that's very relevant to the people that are Research clients. It's also very relevant to people that are not yet Research clients.","And so, we've introduced, as you pointed out, Conferences for GBS, taken for the ones that we've had smaller and those have all done great. They've really grown very rapidly, they've been very attractive to both, the existing Research clients as well as people buying their own ticket separately. And we intend to continue that whole strategy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Andrew Nicholas","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just -- I wanted to talk about GBS a little bit. When we're thinking about your ability to get to double-digit GB growth next quarter, is that entirely a function of generating new GxL business? Or do you think there's still a little bit of room to go in terms of improving your legacy attrition?","Gene Hall","Hey, good morning, Andrew. I think, it's absolutely both, as we've discussed throughout the year. Our focus clearly has been on GxL and GxL new business, and that's been going really, really well for us, as we've described in -- as you can see, in our disclosure information.","I would note, though, that we have also been very focused on improving the attrition rates across the entire GBS portfolio. And so, the numbers we've given over the past couple of quarters have been inclusive of both GxL and the legacy leadership talent pool.","And we've seen really significant and material improvements in our attrition rates and they've improved from quarter to quarter to quarter, with our best quarter so far being Q3. And that's across both GxL and legacy leadership council business.","And so, yes, that is absolutely a big lever for us. The bigger lever is clearly continued momentum in GxL new business. But every dollar we save from an attrition perspective, obviously, helps to accrete the overall growth rate.","Andrew Nicholas","Great. Thank you. And then, within GxL, again, I know you target a number of different verticals there, HR, sales so on and so forth. I'm just curious if you could speak to where you're seeing the most traction. And then, maybe on the flipside, which verticals you would like to see grow a bit faster? Thank you.","Craig Safian","Yes. I'll talk to the quantitative part of that question and Gene can talk strategically. I think, the really nice thing that we've seen since we launched the GxL products is each of the functions that we serve, we've seen really, really strong -- continued strong growth and accelerating growth.","And one of the things we keep mentioning is, more than half of the new business we've generated in each of last three quarters, more than half of it has come from the new GxL products that were launched post acquisition. So, meaning, we're doing well and continue to do well on the marketing and supply chain.","GxL offerings that we had prior to the CEB acquisition, but we're really growing rapidly across all the functions that we now have GxL products for. And, again, whether you look at HR, or legal, or finance, they're all doing really, really well. GxL new business and each of those enterprise functions is up significantly on a year-over-year basis and we've seen really nice progress across all the functions.","Gene Hall","Yes. If I could add to that there, we don't have a place that we sort of say, hey, it's underperforming relative to the expectations.","Andrew Nicholas","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Wanted to go back to the margin discussion. If I go back a number of years ago before you guys bought CEB, now GBS, you were generating adjusted EBITDA margins of close to 19% or so. I know, GBS was a different business.","You've made a lot of investments and a lot of improvements. But I think when you bought the company, you were hoping to make it a Gartner-like company, which you're making significant amount of progress already. Do you think we can get back to these adjusted EBITDA margins around 19% over time?","Craig Safian","Good morning, Jeff. Yes. I think, we are committed, as we talked about, to getting returns on the investments we've made. And we spent a lot of time this morning talking about -- and last quarter as well, talking about and showing that we are aligning our cost structure to our revenue growth.","And so, I think the way to think about it is we are committed to that. We're going to go after that and when we get through 2020, we can start talking about what 2021 and 2022 and 2023 will look like. But for now, I think, we're very focused on finishing this year, making sure that we enter 2020 in the best possible condition both from a bookings perspective and also from a cost structure perspective. And then, we're going to take it from there.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I guess my first question here is just around -- it seems like there's a shift in strategy and that maybe the investment cycle for GxL is over at this point. Is that accurate? And if so, why this quarter versus other quarters?","Gene Hall","So, it's Gene. So there is a shift in strategy. You're right and the shift in strategy we -- over the last three years, we've been investing for the future. In particular, with things like getting the GxL products in place, getting the sales force trained on, getting our sales force capacity up, moving the -- all of the GTS tools and training and so forth into GBS that all took a lot of investment. We've now made those investments, and we feel like there's leverage we can get out of those.","And so, there really is a big shift in strategy from putting those investments in place to now, actually we have them in place and getting acceleration to take advantage of those investments. Obviously, and so, we have been investing ahead of our CEB growth, particularly in GBS. Now we want to make sure that we get all the levers we can out of those investments.","Joseph Foresi","Okay. And then secondly, and I guess this for you Craig, because you get the margin questions or Gene will at least point to you form. On the margin side, if GxL improves and the revenues accelerate there as you're implying with the guidance of the contract value, is it fair to say that margins will follow it up? Because I mean it's been an area of dilution. Or is there any reason to think that there'd be a separation there? Thanks.","Craig Safian","Hi. Good morning, Joe. Thank you. Again, I think the way to think about it is that, as Gene just mentioned, we have invested a lot. The investments are largely in people and we continue to pay those people. And that cost base is relatively fixed, but we'll continue to go up with inflation and things of that nature.","I -- we absolutely do believe that as we accelerate our -- the GxL business and the GBS business in total, that all other things equal, that is definitely a help for our margin profile and margin position.","I would remind you that GBS only represents about 20% of our total contract value and probably only 15% of our total revenue. And so, it does have an impact, but a modest or more muted impact than you might think just given the size of it.","The real kind of margin or profit profile or incremental profitability that we generate really comes out of our GTS business, which is again a $2.6 billion business that's growing at 13% per year.","And again, we remain committed to making sure that we align our cost base with our -- cost base growth, with our revenue growth, and that's how we're thinking about it as we plan for 2020. And as we roll again into future years, we will continue to update everyone on how we're going to manage the business going forward.","Joseph Foresi","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open","George Tong","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You indicated earlier that GBS CV growth will be about 9.6% in the fourth quarter if new business and attrition improvements in the third quarter carry over to 4Q. Can you outline precisely what assumptions that involve and maybe talk about the top two or three factors that could cause the trends from 3Q not to carry over to 4Q?","Craig Safian","Yeah. Hey, good morning George. So, the top line assumptions are new business growth of 26% year-over-year, which is what we achieved in Q3 and about a 500 basis point improvement in the attrition rates, which also is what we achieved in Q3. And so as Gene went through the math, those are the assumptions that we've used to get to that 9.6% based on the amount of contract value we have expiring in the fourth quarter.","As you know, Q4 is a big quarter for us in total for GBS in particular, both on the new business side where we generate a significant amount of our new business in the fourth quarter and also with our expiring CV. It tends to be the -- or it is the highest weighted quarter in terms of expiring CV.","But again, if you just extend what we saw in Q3 into Q4 with the new business improvement and the attrition improvement, if you run that math you get to 9.6%.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. And I want to tackle the margin question a little bit differently. Last quarter, you took down the full year margins from about 17.5% to about 16% at the midpoint for EBITDA because you were pulling forward the open territory highers, and now it sounds like you're going to recalibrate your expense growth to match the top line growth, and it's going to take about a year for 2020 for that to happen so roughly flat margins. But as you manage the margins longer term is there room for the margins to get back to where they were just about a quarter ago in terms of the outlook of around 17.5%? Or do you see a structural change in the business that might cause 16% to be the new norm?","Craig Safian","Hey, George. Excellent job of re-swizzling the question in a thoughtful way, so thank you for that. So again, I think that there is nothing structurally different in the business. We're running it in a very similar way to the way we ran it forever within Gartner. Again, we're very focused for 2020 again as we've talked about around just making sure that our cost growth and our -- is aligned with our revenue growth that's kind of step one in the process. If everything works and goes well is there potential for some margin benefit? Yes, we would say that absolutely. How much? We'll come back to you on that as we kind of get through this first phase, which is really making sure that we are aligned for 2020.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Gene Hall for closing remarks.","Gene Hall","Well, as you heard today, we, once again, delivered strong performance across all three of our businesses Research, Consulting and Conferences. Gartner formula for sustained long-term growth continues to drive success in our Research business. Our GTS organization continues to deliver strong performance. GBS continued on the path towards double-digit growth and we expect GBS contract value to continue to accelerate. We delivered credible value to every major function of the enterprise.","We have a vast market opportunity. We've made investments over the past few years that positions well to capture that market opportunity. And looking ahead to 2020 with the great strategic positioning of GTS and GBS together with leveraging the investments we've made, we expect double-digit topline growth and EBITDA growing approximately in line with revenues. Thanks for listening. We look forward to updating you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

With me today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer. This call will include a discussion of first quarter 2018 financial results and our current outlook for 2018 as disclosed in today's press release.","Following comments by Gene and Craig, we will open up the call for your questions.

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Well, thanks for joining us today. Last year and on our recent Investor Day, we laid out a plan for continuing double-digit profitable growth with Gartner's traditional business while applying the Gartner formula to accelerate the former CEB business. Today, you'll hear we are on track on both objectives, with a strong Q1 exceeding our expectations. Our revenue grew 16%; and EBITDA, 14%. EPS grew 20% compared to standalone Gartner for Q1 2017.","Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Once again, our Research segment had strong performance with revenue growth of 17% and contract value growth of 12%. As we discussed on Investor Day, we now report contract value for Global Technology Sales, or GTS, which is sales to users and providers of technology, and Global Business Sales, or GBS, which includes sales to all other functions.","GTS had another strong quarter. GTS contract value grew 13% with double-digit growth in every region, every size client and inversely every industry. GTS client retention increased to 83% and wallet retention to 104%, both near all-time highs. Our GTS sales head count grew 13% year-over-year, providing a foundation for continued, sustained double-digit growth.","Global Business Sales, or GBS, also had a strong quarter. GBS contract value growth accelerated to 7%. GBS client retention increased more than 400 basis points to 82% and wallet retention increased more than 200 basis points to 99%. These retention improvements are remarkable in such a short time period.","Our integration of CEB is largely complete. We have an integrated organizational structure, have introduced new seat-based products, and then moved to standard Gartner commercial terms. As planned, we've invested to grow GBS head count 20% year-over-year, providing a foundation for sustained, accelerating contract value growth. Our forward-looking metrics for both GTS and GBS remain strong.","Our Events segment combines the outstanding value of our research with the immersive experience of live events, like in every conference we produce, the most important gathering for the executives we serve.","Our Events segment had another strong quarter. Revenues grew 26% and same events revenues, on an FX-neutral basis, grew 19%. During the quarter, we held 14 destination events, with attendance growing 29% compared to Q1 last year. On a same events basis, destination event attendance grew 21% year-over-year.","While Q1 is seasonally small for our Evanta events, revenue for this business accelerated to double-digit growth. And this compares to flat to declining revenue from before the CEB acquisition. The forward-looking metrics for our Events segment remain strong.","The Gartner Consulting segment is an extension of Gartner Research and provides clients a deeper level of involvement through extended project-based work to help them execute on their most strategic initiatives. Our Consulting segment had a solid quarter with Q1 consulting revenues growing 5%.","Our labor-based business had strong performance, growing 14%. Our contract optimization business, which also can vary between quarters, was down 35% year-over-year. Q1 Consulting bookings were strong with backlog up 17%.","Previously, we discussed we'd be divesting businesses, which are not a strong strategic fit with Gartner. We divested CEB Talent Assessment in early April for about $400 million and CEB Workforce Surveys at the end of April for about $29 million. We use the proceeds to reduce our debt.","Our future Gartner is the brightest ever. I recently met with many of our salespeople from around the world. I was inspired by the energy, passion, selling skills, and knowledge of our clients in our GTS and GBS sales teams. The former CEB salespeople, who are now mostly in GBS, have embraced and are rapidly implementing the Gartner formula to accelerate GBS.","We provide incredible value by helping our more than 15,000 enterprise clients with their most important initiatives. The combination of Gartner and CEB allows us to address every role across the enterprise, giving us a huge unpenetrated market opportunity. We've largely completed the CEB integration. We know the right things to do to drive sustained, profitable double-digit growth, the Gartner formula.","Our business economics allow us to drive strong double-digit growth in all our key metrics, including cash flow. And we have an incredibly talented team across the business. Our future has never been brighter.","And with that introduction, I'll now turn over the call to Craig Safian, our Chief Financial Officer.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We continue to see robust demand for our services across the globe. During the first quarter, we saw year-over-year acceleration in our contract value growth, along with improvements in our retention metrics and sales productivity. And as our 2018 outlook continues to demonstrate, we expect to deliver another year of double- digit revenue and EBITDA growth with strong cash flow generation.","First quarter adjusted revenue was $973 million, up 16%. The weaker U.S. dollar contributed about 4 points to the growth rate. Purchase accounting adjustment for deferred revenue was down to a $10 million impact for the quarter. Also, in the first quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $161 million, up 14%, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.72, and free cash flow of $27 million.","Research had another excellent quarter with significant year-over-year growth in revenue and improvements in contribution margin, contract value growth, retention and sales productivity. On a combined basis, Research adjusted revenue grew 17% in the first quarter, with about 3 to 4 points from foreign exchange. The adjusted gross contribution margin for research was 70%, up from last year's 69%. Total contract value was $2.9 billion at March 31, FX-neutral growth of 12% versus the prior year.","New business growth was consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced among new clients, sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. The average spend for enterprise also continues to grow. It now stands at $191,000 for enterprise, up 5% versus the prior year on an FX-neutral basis. This continued and consistent increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth both through new and existing enterprises.","As we discussed at our Investor Day, we are now going to market with two distinct sales forces, Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves technology end users, investors, professional services firms and technology providers; Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves all the other functional areas in the enterprise outside of technology. We will be reporting the key operational metrics by contract value, retention rates and sales productivity for both GTS and GBS.","I'll start with a review of Global Technology Sales for the first quarter. GTS had contract value of $2.3 billion at March 31, representing FX-neutral growth of 13%. GTS client retention was 83%, up 60 basis points versus the first quarter of 2017. Wallet retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Both retention rates for GTS are close to our all-time highs.","GTS new business growth, excluding the heritage CEB technology business, was about 12% in the first quarter. It's tough to compare GTS new business to Q1 2017 due to the full integration of the heritage CEB tech business and no longer selling any heritage CEB products in this space.","We ended the first quarter with 12,363 GTS clients, up 7% compared to Q1 2017. About 75% of our GTS clients don't buy GBS services yet, giving us ample room to expand our client relationships across additional functional areas.","Our investments to improve sales force productivity continue to pay off with an increase again this quarter. For GTS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning of period quota-bearing head count, was $110,000 per salesperson, up 14% versus first quarter last year.","Turning to Global Business Sales results for the first quarter, GBS had contract value of $613 million at March 31, representing FX-neutral growth of 7%. As you know, contract value reflects the amount of annualized contracted revenue at a point in time. It is an important forward-looking measure for Gartner.","After we closed the CEB deal, we aligned their CV reporting with the heritage Gartner methodology. Our first priority was ensuring that we got the reporting 100% accurate for the periods that we own them. For transparency purposes, we also wanted to provide historical figures so that our investors could track the progress we are making.","In March of this year, we went back and reviewed every transaction that occurred during 2017 from both before and after the acquisition close. As a result of that review, we identified roughly $14 million of additional contract value that belonged in the year-end 2016 number. The adjustment arose because these contracts renewed after the Gartner year-end cutoff point but with a contract start date of January 1.","In our investor materials, we've adjusted the Q4 2016 CV number up by $14 million, the majority falling in GBS. The result is that 4Q 2017 growth for GBS was 6% rather than 8%. Other than that, in calculating all values at 2018 FX rates, there are no further adjustments.","Perhaps, most important, there is no change to the outlook for future GBS CV growth. We are also making good progress with GBS retention metrics. GBS client retention was 82%, up more than 400 basis points from the prior year. GBS wallet retention was 99%, up more than 200 basis points versus the prior year.","New business growth for GBS was 13%. We ended the first quarter with 5,697 GBS clients, up 1% versus the prior-year period. About 50% of GBS clients don't buy GTS services, creating an opportunity for us to sell our indispensable technology insight to additional enterprises.","For GBS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing head count, was $61,000, up 13% versus first quarter last year.","Our Research business performance in Q1 was very strong across both GTS and GBS. GTS measures all improved on a year-over-year basis, including CV growth, both retention measures, and sales productivity.","The GBS business also improved significantly with similar year-over-year improvements to key operating measures and a sequential improvement in contract value growth from the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis. As always, we remain focused on continuous improvement in recruiting, training, and tools to support higher sales productivity, a key driver of our short and long-term results.","In Events, adjusted revenues increased by 26% year-on-year in Q1 to $46 million, with about a 7-point benefit from foreign exchange. Events' first quarter gross contribution margin was 35%, up by 370 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.","The first quarter is a seasonally small quarter, but the results were excellent. We had three more events than last year. On a same event FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 19%, with a 21% increase in same event attendees. As Gene mentioned, the forward-looking metrics for Events remain strong.","First quarter Consulting revenues increased by 5% on a reported basis and about 1% FX-neutral. Consulting gross contribution margin was 29% in the first quarter. In the labor-based business, revenues increased 14% versus Q1 of last year with about 6 points from foreign exchange, while the contract optimization business was down 35%.","On the labor-based side, billable head count of 694 was up 7%, and we had 138 managing partners at the end of Q1, up about 10% versus the prior year. Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $104 million, up 17% year-on-year and 12% in FX-neutral terms. Our bookings performance remained strong, and our 2018 pipeline is encouraging.","Adjusted revenue in the Talent Assessment & Other segment increased by 8% compared to the year-ago quarter to $74 million. Gross contribution margin was 63%. We divested CEB Talent Assessment on April 3 for $400 million and CEB Workforce Surveys on April 30 for $29 million. Operating results from both divestitures are included in our first quarter numbers. First quarter revenue from the divested businesses was about $54 million, with EBITDA of about $8 million.","On a combined basis, SG&A increased by 20% year-over-year in the first quarter. Foreign exchange contributed about 3 points to the SG&A growth in the quarter. We are growing sales capacity and the enabling infrastructure to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long-term.","Our sales force continues to be our largest investment. And at the end of the first quarter, we had 3,501 quota-bearing associates across Gartner in GTS and GBS. This is an increase of 445 or 15% from a year ago. This includes 2,746 in GTS and 755 in GBS. The investments in SG&A are in line with our expectations.","Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $161 million, up 14%, with strong revenue growth partially offset by higher SG&A costs as just discussed. Depreciation, amortization and integration expenses were up year-over-year, driven primarily by the CEB acquisition. Interest expense in the quarter was $35 million, up from $6 million on a standalone basis in the first quarter of 2017. The higher interest expense relates to additional debt used to fund the CEB acquisition.","Our adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 20.4% for the quarter. First quarter is typically a seasonally low quarter for the tax rate, primarily due to equity-related excess tax benefits. As we'll discuss in the outlook section, we still expect our adjusted tax rate to be about 26% for the full year.","Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $0.72 with upside relative to our expectations from strong top line performance, the timing of some expenses and investments, as well as a lower tax rate, which is also due to timing. In Q1, operating cash flow was $3 million compared to an outflow of $30 million last year on a reported basis.","Operating cash flow was affected by the CEB acquisition, which is not in the 2017 number, including acquisition integration payments, higher interest costs, and the billing delays we mentioned last quarter. The billing delays accrued as a result of transitioning heritage CEB invoicing into Gartner systems, affecting our cash flow to-date.","We see no challenges or issues with the collectability of these invoices. We've made good progress in April and the first week of May and expect this to be largely caught up by the end of Q2. Our annual free cash flow guidance is unchanged with the exception of the impact of the divestitures. Q1 2018 CapEx was $18 million and Q1 cash acquisition and integration payments and other non-recurring items were approximately $42 million. This yields Q1 free cash flow of $27 million.","During the first quarter of 2018, we repaid $300 million worth of debt. In April, we paid down an additional $450 million, leaving our April 30 debt balance at just under $2.6 billion. That's down more than $1.1 billion since the acquisition a little more than a year ago.","Adjusting EBITDA for the divestitures, our gross leverage ratio is now about 3.8 times, and we are tracking well to our target of around 3 times, which we continue to expect to see by the end of 2018. This is factored into our interest expense guidance for 2018.","Turning to guidance, we are updating our full-year guidance for the divestitures and lower interest expense as a result of utilizing the divestiture proceeds. The updated guidance removes the divested businesses starting from the closing dates and reflects the debt repayment we have made through April 30. Consistent with our historical practice, we will revisit full-year guidance later in the year.","I will now summarize the guidance headlines. All the details are available in the press release and our quarterly earnings deck, both of which are available on our Investor Relations site. For 2018, we expect adjusted revenues of approximately $3.9 billion to $4.0 billion. The adjusted revenue guidance is lower by $175 million, reflecting the divestitures. For 2018, we expected adjusted EBITDA of $710 million to $760 million. The adjusted EBITDA guidance is lower by $40 million reflecting the divestitures.","We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of around 26%. That implies a higher rate for the balance of the year. We expect full-year 2018 adjusted EPS of between $3.51 and $3.91 per share. The adjusted EPS guidance is lower by $0.20, reflecting the divestitures. We expect free cash flow of $416 million to $456 million. At the midpoint, the conversion from adjusted net income is 126%. And lastly for the second quarter of 2018, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.92 and $0.97 per share.","We had a great start to the year with first quarter results coming in better than expected. We saw strength across the segments, improvements in key operating measures and we divested non-core assets. Since January 1, we have reduced our debt balance by about $750 million. The trends going into the second quarter are strong and our teams are working hard to execute the 2018 plan. As we shared with you at Investor Day, we are applying the Gartner growth formula across the combined business and are encouraged with the outlook for the rest of the year and into the future.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please proceed.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Company, LLC","Yes. Thanks. Just want to first ask on GBS', the improvement in growth. Can you break out for us the marketing piece and supply chain pieces versus, I guess, the best of your ability kind of some of the legacy CEB pieces, how much of the improvement was driven by those different parts of the business?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning, Tim, and thank you. So, GBS is performing really well. The leading indicators are all good. The sales teams are ramping up and we remain really confident in the outlook we provided at Investor Day.","As you know, we're now going to market separately as GTS and GBS, and that's how we manage and measure the business. To maximize the performance of the combined company, we integrated our Research teams, our products, and our sales teams. In a number of enterprise functions we serve, we had overlaps, and it's really impractical to separate out the heritage businesses, but what we can say is both the heritage CEB and heritage Gartner components of GBS, they both contributed to the sequential improvement in GBS contract value growth.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Company, LLC","Okay. Thank you. And the 20% growth and I guess the sales force for GBS side, did you ramp that up? I thought you talked about after kind of ramping it up last year kind of watching the productivity of the initial cohort kind of mature and see how it progresses. So, did you \u2013 is your expectations are all around sales force and timing for that side of the business?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, Tim, it's Gene. So, it's exactly we expected. So, as we mentioned before, because the integration was going so well, we moved up our timeframe compared to before we did the acquisition, and our plan all along was to grow the sales force by about 20%. A lot of sales force growth happens January 1, and so \u2013 it actually happens in the first quarter because that's when we do a lot of promotions like from an individual contributor, salesperson to a sales manager. And also we had people in training in Q4 that actually became quota-bearing salespeople in Q1. So, we are right on our plan, and 20% is the exact growth rate that we had planned on.","I'm very excited about it because, as you know, our aspiration is to have a really solid double-digit growth in GBS, and now we have the products to do it, we have the right commercial terms and we have the sales capacity. So, getting that sales capacity there really is one of the essential components and makes me very excited about our future there.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Company, LLC","Okay. Great. And one last one and I'll hand it off. But just, Craig, the guidance, the $0.20, I guess, reduction, I think you had said $0.17 annually previously. So, is there a way to bridge that, I guess, in terms of the impact of the divestitures?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yes, absolutely, Tim. So, the way to think about it is the initial guidance we gave on that was $0.17 for just the Talent Assessment business, assuming a full year impact of a divestiture because we didn't know when the business would actually close. In addition, now we've removed the Workforce Survey & Analytics (sic) [Workforce Surveys & Analytics] business, which we closed also in April, and that was about, on an annualized basis, about $0.05 dilutive impact so, $0.22 in total.","Q1 is the lightest profit quarter. And so, we're looking at a $0.20 impact based on Talent Assessment being out of the business as of April 1 essentially and Workforce Surveys being out as of April 30. So, in line with what we had told you originally, you have to add in the impact from Workforce Surveys divestiture.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Company, LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. I guess, I just want to ask about the line that you included that, I think, you said consistent with our practice that you would consider revising the full year guidance later in the year. I guess, just given the magnitude of the Q1 upside, and I know we're only a quarter into the year here, but are there any offsetting factors that you're seeing that temper the enthusiasm from the Q1 upside, or I guess if you could just revisit your practice with us and if you just would not adjust Q1 guidance no matter what the magnitude of the upside would be?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff, and thanks for the question. I'd say a few things about Q1 and then we can talk about our posture and philosophy as well. If you look at the Q1 results, there are timing elements, particularly the lower tax rate for the quarter, which that will normalize itself over the course of the year.","We definitely had upside. We had strong performance in Q1. But as you referenced correctly, it is a small quarter. It is only the first quarter and it is a small quarter for us as well. And as we look at our forecast, we're still well within the guidance ranges we provided at the beginning of the year. And so, we saw no reason or need to update or adjust our annual outlook, save for the updates on or related to the divestitures.","As we progress through the year and have more visibility into Q2, Q3, Q4, we'll continue to relook at where our forecasts are landing us, and we will adjust accordingly if we need to.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just given the way that your calculation works for sales productivity dividing by beginning AE, I would think there would be some small contribution from the new hires and the accelerated sales force head count growth. So, with that long preamble, on the GBS side or the CEB heritage, I guess, what are you seeing in terms of sales productivity trends? If you could break it out between how are the new hires ramping and then if you look at the established salespeople that came over with CEB or on the GBS side, are they through the period of disruption with all of the change that you pushed through over the last 12 months and started to see improvement there as well?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Hi, Jeff. It's Gene. So, the sales force in the GBS side is doing great. As you saw from Craig's numbers, their current productivity is substantially less than the GTS sales force. There's no reason it shouldn't be at the same level.","And to your point, most of the disruptive changes, we've done now. So, we've reorganized. Everybody knows what their territory is, what their job is, who their boss is. We've introduce the new products. People know what their new products are. They've got those. We changed the commercial terms. That's all done.","So, what it is now is just people getting in the groove and getting more experience with all of these changes. So, we've made the changes. I think they've accepted, it's exceeded my expectations. They've been gone over very, very well both with our salespeople as well as with our clients and prospects.","And so, now that we've made all the changes, now it's a matter of just \u2013 if you're a salesperson and it's the first time you sold a new product, you're not as good on the first time as you are on the second, the third and the fourth. And so, what I expect to see over the coming period of time is that they will get used to these new products, new commercial terms and the new organization. And we should see productivity \u2013 we expect productivity to be at the same kind of rates we have for GTS over time.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just finally for me, I don't know the name of the metric, but I know you measure everything, Gene, so I'm sure you have a metric. Is there a client engagement or usage on the GBS or heritage CEB side? How are you doing in terms of getting it up?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, you're exactly right, Jeff. The usage is really important. Our products can provide a lot of value, but if clients aren't using them, they don't actually realize that value. We know it's really important. One of the ways we've driven the great retention we have on the GTS side has been through driving increased usage of our products.","We're well aware that the usage historically was lower on the GBS side, and so we have programs in place, it's part of the Gartner formula, we have programs in place, again, that we have implemented, it will take time to fully kick in, but we've implemented what we believe will drive retention to the same levels as we have in GTS, again, over time.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. My first question is, I guess, I understand you guys are going to market in these two different segments on the Research side. Just to try and help us, though, I mean, how should we think about the progress for the total fee be relative to your target of getting them to double-digit growth in three years that you had set out when you came in? Like, how is it looking today? And, I guess, going forward, it doesn't sound like you'll be able to give us that. So, how should we measure how that's tracking?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, in answer your first question, we're tracking really well. The things that are going to get GBS up to the same levels of GTS are things like, do we have the right products. Yes, we have the right products. Do we have the right commercial terms? Yes, we have the right commercial terms. Have we expanded the sales force and are we hiring the right people, giving them the right training and the right tools?","All those things are in place. And so, as I mentioned earlier, I think the \u2013 now it's a matter of \u2013 okay, they've got the new tools, they've got the new products, it's a matter of \u2013 there's a learning curve. And as our salespeople and their leaders go with that learning curve, you'll see great improvements in productivity, and that's what's going accelerate the growth.","But the great thing is, which I'm really excited about, is all the foundational pieces are there. So, again, like I said, if you've got the right products, you've got the right service support, you've got the right tools, you've hired the right people, you've grown the sales force 20%, it's a matter of when, not if, in my opinion.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Okay. And, Manav, the other thing I would add is that, as we talked about at Investor Day, of the GBS portfolio, 75% of the contract value that we put in there to constitute that portfolio, 75% related to heritage CEB contract value, roughly 25% to the heritage Gartner stuff we moved over there, and as I just mentioned, previously, both pieces contributed to our acceleration in the first quarter. And so, as GBS accelerates, and again meets the targets we laid out at Investor Day, 75% \u2013 we're not going to be able to do that without the former heritage CEB products contributing mightily to that.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Again, I guess, just maybe can you just help clarify then, in GTS, how much of that was the legacy CEB, and what was that growing?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","So, in GTS, it was really a de minimis amount compared to the overall. I think at Investor Day, it was less than $100 million, and that was following the typical CEB contract value trend prior to the acquisition, so declining, but again a very small portion of the GTS portfolio.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the guidance as well to clarify, I think you said you updated that for the lower interest expense as well, right? So, I'm just trying to think the $0.20 reduction in the EPS, I guess, does that factor in that you said or...","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yes, Manav, it does. So, what we factored in is the all-in removal \u2013 or all-out removal of all the expenses and revenues and profits related to the Talent Assessment business and the Workforce Surveys business with the corresponding offset or lowering of interest expense as we've used those proceeds to reduce our debt balances.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. You talked a couple times about the 20% increase in head count growth in the GBS business. How should we think about growth for the rest of the year in that business going forward? Are you sort of done in terms of ramping up, or is there a little bit more to go?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, Toni, we're going to follow the same path with GBS that we always follow with GTS, which is we've increased our sales head count by 20%. For 2019, we're going to want to grow our sales head count again. And so, we'll start \u2013 in fact, we've got the recruiters in place already, and the programs will start recruiting so that a year from now, we'll grow our sales force at GBS. And we haven't finalized the number yet but just thinking double-digit rates so that we can sustain the double-digit growth in contract value over time.","If we \u2013 as always, if between now and then, productivity isn't improving as we expect or there's some problem like that, we, of course, will slow down and figure out what the problem is \u2013 so we're not going to do it just blindly, but with the great productivity numbers we're seeing now and the great acceleration, the path we're on now is that we hire toward the late \u2013 think about getting people into training in Q3 and Q4 so they do a lot of territory in Q1 in GBS just like we would always do in GTS.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And, Craig, just given potential for rising interest rates, would you consider hedging some of your floating rate debt just given that there is still a lot of it left?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, Toni. Thanks for the question. Yeah. We've actually \u2013 if you look at our debt balances, we've got $800 million in high yield, which is fixed at 5.125%, and then we've got $1.4 billion of interest rate swaps to essentially hedge the floating portion of our revolver term loan A and term loan B. And so, as we continue to delever, we've got the vast majority of our debt instruments now essentially locked in with interest rates due to the nature of the instruments and the hedging we put in place.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Excellent. Thanks. Sorry, I missed the $1.4 billion of hedges. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. There's a widespread in sales force productivity between your GTS and GBS segments. When do you expect NCVI per salesperson of GBS to approach GTS levels? And are there any structural barriers such as contract pricing or terms that can impact that convergence?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, George, it's Gene. So, to answer the second part of your question first, which is we expect GTS productivity to continue to improve. So, we're not stopped there. And GBS, as you point out, is half or little less of GTS; we intend to close that gap as quickly as we can. As I said earlier in the call, we really have all the pieces in place to do that, so now it's a matter of our salespeople to be on the learning curve. There's no structural reason why GBS sales productivity shouldn't be at the same level as GTS, and that's certainly what we aspire to over time.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. You indicated that some of the margin performance this quarter reflected the timing of certain expenses. Can you quantify this timing and what your remaining investment priorities are for this year?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning, George. Yeah, I think it's less about timing. It just happens to be a lighter-revenue quarter for us, so the margin can be a little more sensitive to our investing. As I mentioned during the SG&A portion of our prepared remarks, the investment profile and investments are kind of right where we expected them to be. We'll continue to make the right investments that we think can drive and support long-term sustainable double-digit growth, but through Q1, we're pretty much on plan with where we thought we were going to be from an investment perspective.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just on cross-selling. You had thrown some statistics around on, and correct me if I'm wrong, 75% of GTS not buying from GBS, 50% of GBS not buying from GTS. Maybe if you could just frame for us, is the customer base buying these products from someone else, or is this going to be a completely new product sale for them, so that they're not buying from anybody right now, and in order to drive cross-selling, this would be essentially net new business?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, in general, when we sell a new individual client, they are not using someone else for another syndicated research service, whether it'd be in technology, in HR, legal, finance, in whatever function. And so, it's really going in and explaining to them a product that they have never bought before and may not understand \u2013 in general, don't really understand the value, which is why our sales force is so important is because they go in, they explain the value that the clients can get from it, and we do that, they buy and they renew at high rates. And so, that's really what's going on there. It is a new sale.","In terms of the cross-sell, the fact that this is a sale that most people that haven't \u2013 that are not \u2013 clients haven't used syndicated research, obviously, it's helpful if you're one client and we're selling to the head of HR an HR product, but the CIO doesn't know about syndicated research. If you have the head of HR say, hey, you should try this and do a referral, that's obviously helpful compared to just a plain cold call.","And so we have \u2013 in just our existing client base, we have a huge opportunity both with GTS selling into clients that are only GBS today, and GBS selling into clients that are only GTS today. I can tell you both sales forces are incredibly excited about the prospect that now they can go into these companies or these functional areas where they may not be buying from Gartner today, but their references from some other part of Gartner that can both help, both refer individual people but also help them to understand the client context, which helps the sales productivity and close rates.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","That's very helpful. And then maybe just to follow up, any color you can give us what you're seeing regionally, North America, Europe? Any changes there? Anything to call out? Any trends there would be helpful.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, I would say that every region in the world is performing kind of, what I would call, in normal terms, meaning that there are companies that have troubles, there are, in some cases, governments that have trouble, but it's kind of a normal selling environment. And again, we know how to sell whether companies are \u2013 economies are doing well or not doing well. And we just take whichever approach is needed in those.","But, overall, I'd say it's what I'd characterize as a normal selling environment, not super fantastic good, not bad, but kind of normal, and that's true for everywhere around the world. There's no particular region that I would say is particularly better or worse than kind of what I call normal.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. So, just a quick question on the contract optimization piece, you mentioned that was down 35%, but then you also mentioned the backlog being relatively strong. I just wanted to ask for some color there.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, Bill. So, our contract optimization business, as, if you've followed Gartner, know that it's pretty lumpy. It could be \u2013 it's done on a contingency fee basis, and it could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. It's a great business, provides a lot of value to clients, but it can be somewhat lumpy compared to most of the rest of our business. And so, that's kind of what's going with that.","Our backlog was up 17%...","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","12% FX-neutral.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","...yeah, 12% FX-neutral. So, we had great bookings. Most of the backlog, the vast majority of the backlog would be in our labor-based business. It could happen a deal was in contract optimization but mostly it would be our labor-based business. And so, when you look at the backlog, it's saying \u2013 in fact, we talking about it in these results, our labor-based business had a very strong Q1, and the backlog is very strong as well, which says that the future looks pretty good too with kind of double-digit rates, which is, obviously, a big step-up from where we've been over the past few years. And contract optimization is fundamentally \u2013 has some good \u2013 higher some quarters, lower some other quarters.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","I'd also add, Bill, that \u2013 and I think you know this, the contract optimization revenues represent typically less than 20% of the segment revenues. So, the bulk of the business is the labor-based business. And as Gene and I both went through, we had a very good labor-based performance in Q1 both from a revenue flow-through perspective, from a bookings perspective, and that translated into the strong backlog position as well.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And one follow-up if I could, I wanted to ask the \u2013 to double-check the calculation, the first quarter 2018 constant currency revenue growth, if it were including \u2013 or should I say, excluding the divested businesses, just to get a sense for what kind of \u2013 what the ongoing organic revenue growth is going to be post the divestitures?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. So, on a combined basis, reported revenue growth, excluding the impact of the divested businesses, would have been 17%. We saw 3 to 4 points of foreign exchange, so think in the 12%, 13% range is the combined revenue growth in Q1, excluding the divested businesses.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","Drew Kootman - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Good morning. This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. You mentioned the integration for CEB is mostly complete. Could you remind us where some of the top line synergies are coming from and where you expect them to come from moving forward?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning. In terms of the way we're thinking about the integration and the way we built the business case, it was really about reigniting the growth of the heritage CEB contract value, now, mostly GBS. And the way we were going to do that was by, again, as we went through it at Investor Day, really leveraging the Gartner formula that we know works to grow that type of business, but that's improving the engagement, as Gene talked about earlier, which translates into higher retention rates, which we are seeing, that is increasing sales capacity which we are doing, that is focusing and improving the sales productivity of the GBS sales force, which we are seeing as well. Again, we still have a lot of room to go between the GBS productivity and the GTS productivity, but we're certainly on the right track there.","And then, also eliminating or standardizing around what we know to be best practices around contracting terms and things of that nature. And so, we've implemented just about all of those things. We are seeing improved retention rates. We are seeing improved productivity. And we have increased the capacity of the sales force pretty significantly. And that's what, we believe, will be the driver to getting the GBS contract value to grow similar to what we've historically seen for the GTS business.","Drew Kootman - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And can you go through some of the factors driving the better performance in Events in the last few periods?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. So, Events has been doing great. And there's two pieces of our Events business. One is attendees and the second is our exhibitor sales. Both have been growing at great double-digit rates.","On the attendees side, it's really about having the right content and doing great marketing to the events. And so, again, we've got great content from our Research organization. We've got a terrific marketing organization, which has done a really good job of getting that out to our potential attendees, and that's working really well.","On the exhibitors' side, as we mentioned, last year we had some problems with open sales territories and we have discovered you sell less in a territory with no salesperson than you do with a salesperson. We've solved that problem now. We have full sales territories and so that's why you're seeing our exhibitor sales back on the track that they \u2013 most of the time that's been where Events has been, in a very good spot, good double-digit exhibitor growth. Sales territories are filled. Our sales productivity there is very good. And so both sides of the business are performing as they have generally done in the past.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And I would just add one other point, which is \u2013 and Gene referenced this in his prepared remarks around the acquired Evanta business, which upon acquisition was not in the best shape and we've really focused on making sure we fortified that business and got it back on a good growth trajectory. Q1 was a small quarter but very positive, and that is now contributing to growth as well.","Drew Kootman - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you so much. Just wanted to go back to your plans for adding to head count in GBS, I'm just curious, are the type of people that you're looking for adding there different from the type of people that you're recruiting at GTS? And if not, how do you steer them to one division as opposed to the other?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, Jeff, it's two things. One is we have sales forces that sells to smaller companies, mid-size companies and larger companies and there's different kind of expectations. So, someone who comes in and joins us for our sales force is selling to what we call mid to small-sized enterprises, generally, we don't have a specific background in mind in terms of function. We bring them in and they might have an interest in a particular area, if not, we kind of channel them to the place where we have the most need.","As you get to larger companies, so if you're selling to the CIO of a Fortune 50 company, they expect the salesperson that's calling on them to have some knowledge about the functional area. It's same for the head of HR, same for the general counsel. And so with our more senior sales force, it would be more likely we want to hire somebody that has some expertise in the functional area in which they've been selling.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. And then shifting gears going forward when you report your historical data, are you going to be excluding the businesses that you've divested or are we going to be comping against, I guess, what that combined company looked like last year?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","So, we're not going to go back and restate prior year. We will attempt to provide enough clarity so that everyone can pull out the appropriate results from the divested businesses. I'm glad you asked, Jeff, to give you a sense, in 2017, these two businesses contributed $223 million worth of revenue and about $47 million of EBITDA. The way to roughly think about it is those were spread roughly evenly over the four quarters. And so, that should help in removing those businesses from what would look like ongoing results for 2017.","For 2018 in the first quarter, the divested businesses contributed $54 million in revenue and $8 million in EBITDA. And, again, as you saw, we pulled out from the balance of the year outlook $175 million in revenue and $40 million in EBITDA. So, I apologize, I just threw lots of numbers at all of you, but those are the facts related to the divested businesses.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Craig, I think you mentioned in your comments a little bit about the pricing at CEB, but can you remind us where you are in the process of moving to the seat-based pricing model? And at this point, are you seeing any year-to-year increases or what are you doing in terms of pricing year-to-year at CEB?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning, Peter. Thanks. Yeah. I think the way we're approaching it is twofold. So, one is we've eliminated discounting. So, our salespeople no longer sell on price, they are actually selling on value. So, that's one element of the pricing conversation.","The other element is in most of the functional areas that we sell to, we've converted from the previous Leadership Council model, which was an enterprise price model to a seat-based model. And the seat-based pricing is very consistent with the way we've historically priced our seat-based products on the heritage Gartner side or now GTS side.","So, again, we're going at pricing in two ways: one, eliminating the discounting; and, two, converting people over to seat-based pricing that looks a lot like the way Gartner has always priced their seat-based products.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So, Craig, eliminating the discounting, I would think, would translate into a fairly significant year-to-year effect to price increase, is that correct?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","So, Peter, the one nuance there is that when we say eliminate discounting \u2013 I'm sorry, I should have been clearer on this, that is on new sales. So, if there is a client who has a discounted Leadership Council, we are not forcing them to migrate to a different product, and we are not forcing them to significantly uplift our price. We have found in our experience that clients don't like when we do that to them, and so if they are happy with what they have, with the pricing they have, we are happy to renew them with a roughly 3% increase and continue to take their money year after year, and again and provide value to them. So, the non-discounting comment really refers to new business sales.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Understood. Thank you. And then, Craig, one other thing, on the SG&A cost, can you give us any more granularity in terms of the composition of costs, and what you're seeing in different components of SG&A costs?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Sure. Happy to. I think the year-over-year compare is really messy because of when the combination took place. If you look at it sequentially, we're up about $20 million in SG&A costs from Q4 2017 to Q1 2018 in FX-neutral terms. The bulk of that increase relates to the more selling capacity, particularly the significant jolt, as we've talked about, that we've put into the GBS sales force with that 20% net head count growth.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","This now concludes the Q&A portion for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gene Hall for any closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. So, summarizing, we had a very strong Q1, and our future at Gartner is the brightest ever. We provide incredible value by helping our more than 15,000 enterprise clients with their most important initiatives. The combination of Gartner and CEB allows us to address every role across the enterprise, which gives us a huge unpenetrated market opportunity. We've largely completed the CEB integration. We know the right things to do to drive sustained, profitable double-digit growth, which we call the Gartner formula.","Our business economics allow us to drive strong double-digit growth in all our key metrics, including cash flow, and we have an incredibly talented team across the business. I want to thank you for joining us today, and I look forward to updating you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, thanks, Sherief. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our Q4 and full-year earnings call.","As you may have seen from our press release earlier today, we continue to perform well in 2015. We delivered against all our key metrics for the year, including double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, and earnings per share. I remain bullish about our business. We're getting better, stronger, faster every year, and our results reflect it. We drove another year of double-digit contract value growth in every geography, across all client sizes, in every industry, except energy and utilities, where we had single-digit growth.","Because of ongoing currency fluctuations, I'll review our results in FX-neutral terms, so you have an easier basis for comparison. For the full-year 2015, contract value growth was up 14%. Total company revenues grew 13% and EBITDA was up 13%. This performance was driven by robust quarter-over-quarter results and demand for our services remained strong.","Research, the core of our business and our largest and most profitable segment, grew revenues 18% in the fourth quarter 2015 and contract value grew 14%. These results represent 24 quarters of consecutive double-digit contract value growth. Enterprise client-level retention was at 84% and enterprise-level wallet retention was at 105%, both down a point from Q4 2014.","Our Consulting business represents opportunity for us to deepen our Research relationships with our largest clients. Our Consulting business revenue increased 5% in Q4 2015. We also grew backlog 19% in Q4, representing our biggest backlog ever. One of the core strategies in Consulting is to increase the number of managing partners, and we ended the year with 109 managing partners, up 18% over last year.","Our Events business drove another quarter of double-digit growth in Q4, with revenues up 17%. We hosted more than 24,000 attendees across 15 events in the quarter, including our flagship conference series, Symposium\/ITxpo.","Finally, our supply chain and digital marketing business has continued to grow significantly faster than our average.","These results reflect the tremendous value we deliver to our clients and all of this occurred against a challenging economic backdrop. Current estimates predict revenues and earnings for the top 500 companies in the U.S. declined during 2015.","Many major economic countries and regions around the world experienced slowing economic growth or outright declines. Our clients in the oil and gas industry suffered from a 60% decline in oil prices, which also impacted entire countries and regions. Unemployment rates in many European countries remained high, and virtually all currencies continued to weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In this environment, we achieved double-digit contract value growth, and once again delivered on our key metrics for the year.","Whether enterprises or leveraging technology to disrupt entire industries or being disrupted by technology, or leveraging technology to drive operational efficiencies, technology remains a key component of their solutions. This makes technology a necessity for virtually every enterprise.","Gartner is at the heart of technology. Our clients rely on us for independent, objective and fact-based insights when making critical technology decisions. For most of our clients, we represent substantially less than 1% of their IT budgets, while delivering tremendous value and a very high return on their investment.","In addition, our business is highly diversified by industry, geography and size of client. That's why despite the economic disruptions I just mentioned, we achieved double-digit growth in every geography, across all client sizes, in every industry, except energy and utilities where we had single-digit growth.","Because Gartner is a people business, we continue to make significant investments in our talent. In 2015, we added more depth to our global analyst community. We invested in recruiting and in training. We continue to improve our customer service processes.","In addition to our core IT businesses, we continue to accelerate our growth in supply chain and digital marketing, and we augmented our offerings in the small business space with two strategic acquisitions, Nubera and Capterra. Finally, for the full year we repurchased more than $0.5 billion of our shares.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Craig, who'll provide more detail on our business results.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. 2015 was yet another strong year for Gartner. We delivered on our financial goals, while continuing to make significant investments to support our key strategic objectives and drive long-term value for our shareholders.","We continue to see robust demand for our services across the globe, and the midpoint of our 2016 outlook, which I will discuss in a moment, is consistent with our focus on delivering consistent double-digit revenue and earnings growth, strong free cash flow generation, as well as maintaining a healthy balance sheet and liquidity profile.","During the fourth quarter, we delivered double-digit constant-currency growth in contract value, revenue, and earnings. Our exceptional business model and focus on cash flow created a consistently high level of free cash flow conversion, with a rolling four-quarter free cash flow conversion of 156% of normalized net income. On an FX-neutral basis, our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included contract value growth of 14% and Research revenue growth of 18%, Events revenue growth of 15% on a same-event basis, Consulting revenue growth of 5% with backlog growth of 19%, and normalized EBITDA growth of 19%.","As Gene mentioned, the demand for our services remain strong across all of our business segments. We are continuing to execute on our strategy to capture the market opportunity ahead of us, winning new enterprise accounts and extending our penetration within existing clients. We delivered these results despite some of the specific challenges that Gene just discussed. As we all know, the energy sector is extremely challenging globally and our business selling to clients in this sector impacted our contract value growth and sales force productivity. I will come back to this later in my remarks.","Before taking your questions, I will discuss our fourth quarter business segment performance in depth; provide some comments on balance sheet and cash flow dynamics, before closing with remarks on our 2016 guidance.","Beginning with Research; Research revenue grew at 13% on an as-reported basis and 18% on an FX-neutral basis in the fourth quarter. Our newest acquisitions had a roughly 4 point positive impact on Research revenue growth for the quarter. The gross contribution margin for Research was 68%, a 90 basis point decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. On a full-year basis, the gross contribution margin for Research was 69% in 2015, flat when compared to the full-year 2014. For both Q4 and the full year, our newly acquired businesses had a slightly negative impact on the gross contribution margin in Research.","All of our other Research business metrics remained very strong. Contract value grew to $1.761 billion, a growth rate of 14% on an FX-neutral basis. As Gene previously mentioned, our growth in contract value was broad based, with every region, every client size, and every industry segment with the exception of energy and utilities, growing at double-digit rates. The energy and utilities sector actually grew for us in 2015; however, the growth rate in that sector slowed when compared to the performance from 2014.","As we've discussed in the past, our business is highly diversified with our contract value mix roughly reflecting the GDP in each country that we do business in. For Gartner, the energy and utilities sector represents less than 5% of our contract value.","From a regional perspective, it is worth noting that although contract value grew at double-digit rates across all major regions, our contract value growth continued to be impacted by a few countries where growth has slowed, for example, Brazil. We have a few markets where the macroeconomic and\/or local currency situation is extremely challenging for many of our clients. Despite these macro challenges, we delivered 14% global CV growth.","We continue to drive CV growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business. Client retention was 84%, down slightly from the fourth quarter 2014. Wallet retention ended at 105% for the quarter, also down slightly, but once again impacted by the macro challenges I just mentioned.","Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retain a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we have discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a rolling four-quarter basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","New business increased 9% year-over-year in Q4. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. Our contract value growth also benefits from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting. We have increased our prices every year since 2005, and as mentioned last quarter, we implemented a price increase on October 1 that averaged just north of 3%.","Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises. We ended the fourth quarter with 10,796 enterprise clients, up 8% compared to Q4 2014, and the average spend per enterprise continues to grow on an FX-neutral basis, again reflecting our ability to increase our contract value by driving growth in both new and existing enterprises.","Turning to sales productivity; as we have detailed in the past, we calculate sales productivity as the net contract value increase, what we call NCVI per account executive. We look at it on a rolling four-quarter basis to eliminate seasonality and we use opening sales head count as the period denominator. Over the last 12 months, we grew our contract value by $211 million in FX-neutral terms.","Using our Q4 2014 ending sales head count of 1,881 as our beginning of period denominator, yields NCVI per AE of $112,000 on a rolling four-quarter basis or a 5% decline over fourth quarter last year when the comparable figure was $118,000 per account executive at constant currency rates. The modest year-over-year decline in productivity was driven primarily by the deceleration in the energy and utilities sector and a small number of markets, many that have energy as a large portion of their economy.","To sum up, we delivered another strong quarter in Research. Despite challenges in the energy and utilities sector as well as a tougher overall operating environment, we delivered contract value growth of 14% with retention rates near historical highs. Although we saw a slight decline in productivity in Q4, we are confident that the productivity initiatives we have in place and have recently introduced will positively impact contract value growth in 2016 and ultimately Research revenue growth over the longer term.","Moving to Events; our Events segment had a great Q4 to end a great 2015. On an FX-neutral basis, Events revenues increased 17% year-over-year in the quarter. We held two more events in Q4 than the same quarter last year. As I noted earlier, on a same-events basis revenues were up 15% year-over-year. During the quarter, we held 15 events with 24,208 attendees compared to 13 events with 23,453 attendees in the fourth quarter of 2014.","During the quarter, we held most of our Symposium events. Gartner Symposium is our flagship conference series, specifically designed for CIOs and senior IT leaders. Symposium revenue growth was in line with our total Events revenue growth for the quarter.","Events' Q4 gross contribution margin was 57%, up a point compared to the year-ago quarter. On a full-year basis, Events revenue increased by 18% in 2015 with 65 events versus 61 events in 2014, and its gross contribution margin increased by 250 basis points to 52%.","Turning to Consulting; on an as-reported basis, Consulting revenues were approximately flat year-on-year, but increased by 5% on an FX-neutral basis. The labor-based business was up 2% versus Q4 of last year at constant currency. We also saw a strong year-on-year growth in Q4 for our contract optimization practice. As we've discussed in the past, our contract optimization practice has a higher degree of variability than the other parts of our Consulting business. This can significantly impact the results of this segment, either positively or negatively.","Our ongoing investment in managing partners is driving demands for our services. We now have 109 managing partners, an 18% increase over fourth quarter 2014. The underlying operating metrics of our Consulting business also remain strong. On the labor-based side, billable head count of 606 was up 13% from the year-ago quarter, and fourth quarter annualized revenue per billable head count ended at $389,000. The decline in revenue per billable head was driven by a combination of FX, lower utilization and a richer mix of more junior consultants who bill at lower rates.","Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business ended the quarter at $118 million, up 19% over this time last year on an FX-neutral basis. This equates to the highest ever backlog in our Consulting business and represents over four months of (17:02) backlog, a great way to enter 2016. When combined with the visibility we have into the pipeline, we believe the Consulting business is well positioned to meet our targets for this year.","Moving down the income statement; SG&A increased by $20 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the growth in our sales force. As of the end of 2015, we had 2,171 direct quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 290 or 15% from a year ago, and consistent with our previous guidance.","In the fourth quarter, SG&A was 70 basis points lower as a percentage of revenues than the year-ago quarter, primarily due to better G&A leverage, which more than offset the continued investments in our sales capacity, recruiting and training capabilities.","Moving on to EBITDA and earnings; we delivered another solid quarter of earnings growth. Normalized EBITDA was $137 million in the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year on a reported basis, and up 19% on an FX-neutral basis. For the full year, normalized EBITDA was $408 million, representing 5% growth for 2015, or 13% increase on an FX-neutral basis.","Moving down the income statement; depreciation, amortization, and acquisition and integration charges were all up year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher capital spending to support our growth, as well as the impact of our recent acquisitions. Interest expense was $6 million in Q4, reflecting our increased borrowing, which I will cover in more detail in a few moments.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 32% and our tax rate for the full year was 35.5%. The tax rate was lower than projected for the quarter and year for two primary reasons. First, in December, the U.S. government enacted the PATH Act, which included the retroactive extension of several favorable tax provisions. Second, our mix of earnings was more favorable than we had originally forecasted, with a modestly higher proportion of our pre-tax earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Adjusting for acquisition charges, our normalized tax rate for the full-year 2015 was 34.8%.","GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78 in the fourth quarter 2015. Our GAAP EPS includes roughly $0.14 worth of acquisition and integration charges. EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges, was $0.92 per share in Q4, up 28% versus Q4 of 2014. For the full-year 2015, our fully diluted GAAP EPS was $2.06. GAAP EPS includes $0.33 of acquisition and integration charges. EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges, was $2.39 per share for the full year, an increase of 7% on a reported basis and approximately 12% on an FX-neutral basis.","Turning now to cash; for the full-year 2015, operating cash flow of $346 million was essentially flat compared to full-year 2014. This was driven by the adverse impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, higher acquisition-related incentive payments, and higher cash taxes, which offset higher year-on-year EBITDA and cash inflows from working capital. On an FX-neutral basis, operating cash flow increased by approximately 7% in 2015.","Consistent with the negative working capital dynamics that are a key characteristic of our subscription-based business model, we generated free cash flow well in excess of net income in 2015. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow, less capital expenditures, with cash acquisition and integration payments added back. This equated to $316 million in 2015 or $3.72 per share on a fully-diluted basis. When compared to our 2015 EPS, excluding acquisition and integration charges of $2.39, this represents a net income to free cash flow conversion of 156%, consistent with our free cash flow conversion of 153% from 2014.","Share repurchases and strategic acquisitions continue to be our primary uses of our free cash flow and available capital. During 2015, we took significant steps to deliver value to our shareholders, utilizing more than $700 million of cash on share repurchases and strategic acquisitions.","First on share repurchases, in 2015, we repurchased $509 million worth of shares, including $56 million in the fourth quarter and repurchased an aggregate of 6.2 million shares for the year.","Second, on acquisitions, which totaled $196 million in 2015; the addition of Capterra and Nubera fit squarely within our strategy, allowing us to meet the different needs of smaller-sized enterprises with different business models. Both assets have attractive economics and accelerate our ability to capture the market opportunity ahead of us.","We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and cash position, including the acquisitions and share repurchases I just mentioned. As of December 31, we had gross debt of $825 million. We have $700 million of interest rate swaps in place, which effectively lock in our interest rates through September 19 on this portion of our debt. Our cash balance as of December 31 was $373 million, with 94% of our cash located outside of the U.S. The combination of our debt and cash positions represents a net debt position of $452 million, or about 1.1 times normalized EBITDA.","Our current credit facility runs through 2019, that and our ongoing free cash flow generation gives us ample liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive shareholder value. As of December 31, we had an additional $656 million of revolver capacity.","We continue to look for other value-creating acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We also believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital. As of December 31, we had $1.13 billion available under our share repurchase authorization.","Turning now to guidance; as always, we'll be providing you with guidance for revenue at a total company and segment level, normalized EBITDA, free cash flow, and EPS. Our EPS guidance is on both a GAAP and adjusted basis, with the latter excluding acquisition and integration charges. We'll also provide you with insight into the larger line items below EBITDA that get us to our EPS guidance range.","The mid points of our guidance are consistent with our performance over the last several years, as we are again predicting double-digit growth to revenues, EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow on an FX-neutral basis. Our 2016 plan also includes investments that support our key strategic objectives and drive long-term value for our shareholders.","The details of our 2016 outlook are also included in today's press release, but to summarize, our base-level assumptions for our guidance are as follows. Our sales force grows approximately 15%, sales productivity remains roughly flat from 2015 levels on an FX-neutral basis, and we have used foreign exchange rates from this week in setting our guidance and outlook for the year. As is our practice, we will provide updates on our quarterly earnings calls should there be any changes to any of these assumptions.","For 2016, we are expecting total revenues of $2.39 billion to $2.45 billion, or 12% to 15% growth on an FX-neutral basis. A little less than 2 points of that growth can be attributed to the impact and timing of our recent acquisitions.","Turning to our three business segments; first, revenues for the Research segment are expected to be $1.785 billion to $1.815 billion in 2016, FX-neutral growth of 14% to 16%. Again, continuing our trend of mid-teens growth for our largest, most profitable and more cash-generative segment.","Second, we expect Consulting revenues of $330 million to $345 million, or 2% to 7% FX-neutral growth compared to 2015. And third, we expect to deliver Events revenues of $275 million to $290 million, 10% to 16% growth on an FX-neutral basis. This continues our five-year trend of high growth for this segment. We currently expect to hold approximately 63 events in 2016.","We expect normalized EBITDA for the full-year 2016 to be between $440 million and $470 million, or 9% to 17% growth over 2015 on an FX-neutral basis.","Below EBITDA, we expect the costs associated with stock-based compensation expense in 2016 to be approximately $51 million to $52 million. Total depreciation expense should be approximately $38 million, and we expect amortization to be around $24 million. We expect acquisition and integration charges of $22 million and interest expense between $27 million and $28 million.","We are projecting an annual effective tax rate for GAAP of approximately 36% and approximately 35% for earnings, excluding acquisition and integration charges. Please note that our tax rate may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the geographic mix of earnings, as well as the timing of certain items.","Our GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 is to be between $2.15 and $2.37 per share. This includes $0.40 per share of acquisition-related charges. Excluding acquisition and integration charges, our guidance for EPS is to be between $2.55 per share and $2.77 per share in 2016. This represents FX-neutral growth of approximately 8% to 18% compared to full-year 2015, or approximately 13% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Please note that our guidance is based on average fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 82 million to 83 million shares for the full-year 2016.","In 2016, we expect cash from operations of $350 million to $375 million, gross capital expenditures of approximately $47 million, and cash acquisition and integration payments of $42 million. This yields a free cash flow range of $345 million to $370 million, or free cash flow per share of $4.18 to $4.48 in 2016. This equates to 12% to 20% growth when compared to full-year 2015. As in prior years, our free cash flow is expected to again be well in excess of our normalized net income in 2016. Specifically, our guidance implies that we will deliver free cash flow conversion of 150% or greater, in line with our historical range.","Now I'd like to provide some additional information to allow for an understanding of the seasonality and other factors that will impact our revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis. The first quarter of 2016 has a number of larger events that we are moving in from Q2. This is a significant change to our phasing from 2015 and results in more revenue and earnings in Q1 than we have historically delivered, and less in Q2.","As a result, we expect GAAP EPS to be between $0.32 and $0.35 per share in the first quarter of 2016. We expect approximately $0.12 per share of acquisition and integration charges in Q1. Q1 and Q3 still represent our smaller quarters for the year due to seasonality. As in years past, the fourth quarter is expected to be our largest, with more than 50% of the full-year Events revenue occurring in Q4.","Finally, I'd like to spend a moment on the impact of foreign exchange as it relates to our reported contract value. As we have communicated to you in the past, Research contract value is reported on an FX-neutral basis throughout each year. We do this so you can understand the true organic growth in our Research segment. In early January of each year, we restate the opening contract value at current foreign-exchange rates. As a result of changes in FX rates since January of 2015, contract value at January 1, 2016 is approximately $71 million lower than the $1.761 billion reported on December 31. As a result, $1.690 billion is the baseline figure you should use for comparison purposes when judging contract value growth in 2016 on an FX-neutral basis.","So before taking your questions let me summarize. We delivered another very strong quarter in Q4, capping off another strong year. Demand for our services is robust and we continue to provide value to our clients, regardless of the economic environment. In 2015, we delivered 14% contract value growth and we grew the number of enterprises we serve by 8% in 2015 to almost 11,000 enterprises.","Looking ahead, we are in a very strong position as a company, and we continue to invest to capture the market opportunity ahead of us. We have almost 2,200 sales people and our new hires are of the highest quality they've ever been. Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with a positive operating leverage in working capital dynamics inherent in our business model, delivered solid earnings and cash flow growth for the full-year 2015. And we continue to expect to achieve high free cash flow conversion consistent with our historical range of approximately 1.5 times our normalized net income.","Going forward, we will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisitions, and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Finally, our strong close to 2015 positions us well to continue to deliver double-digit growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow into the future. The midpoints of our 2016 guidance reflect those continued trends.","Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please proceed.","Ryan C. Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Ryan filling in for Manav. Just wondering if you could kind of flesh out some of the commentary on the energy markets and how that's affecting productivity? Just to give us a sense of \u2013 I don't think that's getting any better. So just your assumption of flat productivity next year with that commentary on the headwinds you saw in the fourth quarter?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Ryan. This is Gene. So, the energy sector for us, energy and utilities, first is a small portion of our business. As Craig mentioned, it's less than 5% of our overall business. In that sector, despite \u2013 oil prices went from like $100 a barrel to $30 a barrel, so it's a pretty tough environment there. In that environment, we, as I mentioned in my comments, still had single-digit growth. In many of the countries that are in the oil segment, like Brazil, our growth decelerated, but again in Brazil we had double-digit growth.","And so, we're aware of what's going on in the industry and technology is important in oil and gas, in every industry in the world. Even when they have cost problems, often \u2013 in fact, almost always technology's part of the solution, not the problem. So the reason we're able to grow even in very tough environments like that is because technology helps them actually achieve their cost objectives, as well as other parts of their business like looking at how to grow with their clients as well. And so, we're pretty confident that even in tough economic situations with our individual clients or in countries that when we focus on the right issues, which is helping them save costs or helping them grow their revenues, we'll have great growth there.","Ryan C. Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And I guess what I was trying to get at is if productivity is assumed to be flat in the guidance and there were some headwinds, just is there a risk to that if energy continues to persist like that? So just more on the \u2013 how should we think of productivity being impacted by these energy and utility headwinds?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we've assumed \u2013 as Craig mentioned, we've assumed productivity is flat going forward at the rate that we achieved last year. We have a lot of programs to improve productivity. So we're not sort of happy with flat productivity. We've assumed that in the plan because we want to assume what we've actually achieved. We've got improved recruiting. We've got improved training. We've got improved tools for our sales force that we introduced sort of \u2013 that we developed last year and are coming into fruition this year. And all those leading indicators say that our sales productivity should go up.","So, for example, if you look at leading indicators of the people we recruited throughout 2015, that class of new recruits, their leading indicators are that they're going to have better sales productivity than the ones in the previous couple of classes.","Similarly, our training, we continue to enhance. And we've got some really innovative tools we think have potential to increase sales productivity a lot. We haven't baked that in because we want to actually see it happen. And so, we actually are looking for sales productivity \u2013 we're aiming for and working hard to get sales productivity to grow during 2016.","Ryan C. Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And just on the M&A commentary, is there anything particularly industry-wise, geography, that you're focused on? Obviously the small and medium-sized markets were kind of a focus this year. Is that something we should expect to continue or is there anywhere else you're looking?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We track approximately 100 or a few more companies at any given point in time. So there's all different kinds of situations. So I can't really characterize it as being one kind of particular area that we're looking at.","Ryan C. Leonard - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thank you. Another one on productivity and I recognize it doesn't impact this year's financial results all that much. But it was down in Q4 and this may be parsing it a bit too thin looking at one word, but I think you said primarily due to energy utilities and other markets. Are there offsetting factors that are offsetting some of these programs and initiatives that you have in place? Because it sounds like it was down in Q4, you're assuming flat in 2016, and I know you have initiatives, but just you did insert the word primarily, so I'm guessing it's flat to down even outside of energy, utilities and other markets. If you could just help us reconcile that?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. Sure, Jeff. Hey, it's Craig. Good morning. So, the comment was really around the impact from energy and utilities, and then some selective markets, most of which are very reliant on the energy and utility sector. That said, as Gene just alluded to in the answer to the last question, we have been very focused on improving sales productivity and we see great signs and we have great examples of large complements or large teams where we've seen significant improvements in productivity on a year-over-year basis.","That was muted by some of these macroeconomics challenges that we are seeing. But as Gene said, we remain very confident that we're doing all the right things from a recruiting perspective, from a training perspective, and from a tools perspective that will continue to improve productivity into the future.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just a comment maybe on how you're managing sales force head count growth. There is a pretty big spread between constant currency revenue growth in Consulting \u2013 or I'm sorry, Consulting head count growth and that's despite I think a good contract optimization quarter. I know that you said there's more lower bill rate junior consultants, but still a fairly sizeable spread. So how should we think about how you're planning to manage Consulting head count growth in 2016?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. It's a great question, Jeff. A big portion of that growth is actually the investment in management partners. So that's been a strategic priority for us and the business is starting to bear the fruit of those investments. And that's really reflected in that really strong backlog position we see as we're headed into 2016.","We've been adding the bottom of the pyramid, if you will, from a \u2013 more junior consultants to actually fulfill all that backlog. And as always, we'll manage and match our backlog growth, our revenue growth, and our head count growth so that we ensure we deliver to roughly our target margins in that segment.","Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on oil and gas, I guess first off. Could you characterize what your exposure is to oil and gas clients? I realize you've got some country exposure there also, so it might not be cut and dry, but if you could help us with that? And then if you could just perhaps also just talk about what is actually happening there? Is it the larger end of the spectrum of clients that's cutting back? Is it the smaller end? Are they cutting the number of seats? Cancelling subscriptions? And what are the price increases I guess that you're able to put in for the O&G clients that you are retaining?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Anj. It's Craig. So, we wrap up oil and gas in our energy and utility sector. That's the way we characterize it here internally. And as we mentioned earlier, it's less than 5% of our total CV, specifically companies in that sector. And then Gene will take the second part of your question.","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Here's what's going on at kind of an operational level, which is companies in distress in the oil and gas sectors displayed today with the big bowl in prices, they're having budgets that are smaller. So instead of budgets that were growing last year, they're saying, okay, our exploration budget is lower, our HR budget is lower, our IT budget may be lower. And so, of course, they're looking to say, okay, how do we save money? And so your question comes up sort of where does Gartner fit in this? We are a teeny portion of the cost for these companies. To give you a flavor, for a large oil company, we typically be less than two-tenths of a percent of their IT spending for \u2013 if they were a great client of ours, if they were a big client. And so they're not going to save any money by cutting Gartner services.","On the other hand, we are very good at helping our clients to, first, save money within their IT organization and, secondly, to actually use IT to save money more broadly in the entire company through things like automation. And so the value proposition we have to companies in distress is, you can't make your budget, cutting our two-tenths of a percent or less is not going to help you at all. But we can help you cut 10% or 20% of your IT budget and more importantly, we can help you use IT in the rest of the organization to save cost through automation.","At any given point in time in the world, something \u2013 some substantial portion of our clients, like 30%, have budget problems. They're going through bankruptcy. They have problems. So this is something we deal with every day. It's not just in the last year. So we're actually very good at dealing with this problem. And it does affect us. It's a harder selling environment, which is why our growth slowed to single digit instead of double digit in the energy and utilities. But we thrive in that kind of environment.","Again, I just want to highlight an example I gave earlier where Brazil is a country where it's very dependent upon oil. The economy is not doing that great there. And we slowed \u2013 our growth slowed from higher double-digit growth to lower double-digit growth even in that kind of environment. And it's because of the things I just talked about, which is that we can help clients tremendously and have a great return on investment when they're financially distressed. We just have to make sure they understand we can help them actually in managing their costs. It's not \u2013 we're not \u2013 we're a big part of their solution to their problems and we don't cost very much.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. That's helpful. Appreciate the color there. And then I guess on the acquisitions in 2015, would you call out any difference in their outlook in this type of choppy environment versus your core businesses levered to larger enterprises? It seems that they added a little bit more to the growth profile than you were originally anticipating for Q4, but then your outlook is for only 2% in 2016, so if you could just help us parse those.","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me get the first part of that, which is so we bought these companies last year. They are performing at or above our expectations so far, and as we look forward to 2016, we're quite optimistic that they're going to perform at or above our expectations. And Craig, I'll let you...","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. On the 2016 piece, Anj, it's hard to piece together from probably your perspective around looking at the growth rates on the difference pieces of the business. We expect those businesses to grow nicely into 2016. They still represent a teeny, teeny, teeny, teeny portion of the overall Research revenue and the total Gartner revenue, but we do expect them to continue to grow.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the Research contribution margins; they're a little bit lower than what we were modeling and so you mentioned that these were impacted by acquisitions, but just wanted to find out if there was anything else to call out there and if you could sort of size how much acquisitions impacted those Research margins. Thanks.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Toni. Good morning. Q4 is typically our lowest contribution margin quarter for Research. If you look back historically, it's typically always the lowest quarter we have because of a lot of travel and other things related to Symposium season. That said, there were two primary impacts of the gross contribution margin decline on a year-over-year basis. One, modest impact from the acquisitions. They run at modestly lower gross margins. Net margins are good overall, but the gross margins are a little bit lower.","And then the second thing, there was an impact \u2013 and we saw this across the full year, but impacted us in Q4 as well, a little bit from foreign exchange as well. And so, while we are nicely naturally hedged, it isn't always perfect when you get down to Research \u2013 revenue Research, expense, et cetera. So if you look at, we were down 90 bps. I think about half was FX. A little bit, probably about a third was due to the acquisitions and a third due to some other stuff.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just in the Events business, really strong guidance there. So, just wanted to see if you could help us understand a little bit of the growth drivers better. I know historically you've talked about adding about five events or so a year and then have annual price increases. Is there anything else in terms of specific initiatives that you're working on to increase revenue per attendee or anything else that we should be thinking about?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I'll take the first part of that, Toni, which is the \u2013 our Events growth is fundamentally driven by the fact that \u2013 the stuff I talked about before, which is every company is facing opportunities to use technology and is trying to figure out how best to use technology. And so, their senior technology leaders come to our events to help do that. And it could be they're figuring out how to be disrupters, figuring how to deal with disrupters if you're the disruptee or how to use it in their business to drive revenue or cut costs. And so that's fundamentally what's driving it. We have lots of capacity at our existing events. And so, we do add events on a regular basis. But we have lots of capacity at our existing events to keep growing attendees at those events. In addition, as you point out, we have price, I'll let Craig talk about that.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. We because of all the dynamics that Gene just described, that does give us a significantly amount of pricing power in our Events business. And as we shift the mix in terms of getting the right people to the right event, so CIOs and senior IT leaders to Symposium, heads of BI to the BI event, et cetera, as we do a better job of targeting people and getting them to the right events, we're actually able to exercise even greater pricing power. And so, the fact that we do have capacity, the fact that we have a great value and a great product for our attendees and the fact that we do have pricing power, allows us to have confidence around continuing to grow that business at double-digit rates.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Management. Please proceed.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. First question, the new business growth or bookings, I think it was sub 10% for the second quarter in a row and a sharp slowdown from the first half. I guess if that continues at that level that would likely point to further deceleration in contract value. But I know you haven't given that metric consistently till the second half of last year. So is part of this that just comps got more difficult or how do we think about that trending from here and what that might mean for CV going forward? Thanks.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Gary. How are you? So the CV growth is determined primarily by two things. The amount we retain, and the amount of new business we put on top of that. I think your characterization of the tougher compare, particularly in Q4, is accurate. We had an amazingly strong Q4 of 2014, which fueled us and gave us great incremental Research revenue growth as we headed into 2015. We had a strong Q4, as Gene mentioned, as we went through in our remarks. New business was a little bit lighter than we expected. Again, impacted also by some of the macro challenges that we described.","So, as Gene mentioned, energy and utility was a double-digit grower for us and now it's dropped down to single-digit. Brazil was a strong double-digit grower for us, dropped down to modest double-digit growth. All those things also had an impact on new business growth. But again, we remain confident that we can continue to grow our new business growth at strong rates. Manage really strong retention and that will equate to strong productivity into the future.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. It doesn't seem to me that the energy or the weakness in some geographic regions is something that's going to change quickly. So what allows that new business to accelerate from here?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's basically the fundamental piece is, as I talked earlier, which is there's this fundamental demand for help in addressing technology issues across the business. The thing that's going to drive the growth is, we grew our sales force by 15%. If you look at our pipeline going into the year, our pipeline is very strong, and that's what drives the new business growth, which is what kind of gives us confidence. A combination of we have great capacity, all the leading indicators on the count we've been hiring is that they are going to get off to a faster start we've had in the past, and a leading indicator in terms of our actual pipeline looks great as well. So we're pretty confident we're going to have a great new business year in 2016.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. And then just one last one. As you think about the next few years, are there any gating factors to continuing the strategy you've used in recent years of debt financing a good portion of your buy-backs? Did the level of interest rates, and if they rise, does that matter to you? I don't know \u2013 do you look at your leverage ratio based on your U.S. profits since I think all your debt is here? And is that a factor as that's clearly been rising more than your total leverage ratio? Or are you very comfortable that total leverage remains low and that you can continue do this sustainably into the future? Thank you.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's a great question, Gary. So, we do look at it on a total leverage basis. We have gross debt of just over $800 million, net debt of about 1.1 times leverage. And again, we also have this great benefit of amazing free cash flow generation and so we are generating significant amounts of free cash flow year after year after year after year, and again, roughly 60% of that free cash flow gets generated here in North America. So we have that at our disposal.","The other comment I'd make on the interest rate comment, we have locked in $700 million of our $800 million or $825 million worth of debt with interest rate swaps. So we're not \u2013 we don't have exposure on continued interest rate rises on that one and we'll continue to look at our capital structure, look at our free cash flow generation and look at other shareholder enhancing activities, whether they'd be share repurchases, acquisitions or both as we manage our capital structure on a go forward basis.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon of William Blair. Please proceed.","Stephen H. Sheldon - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. In for Tim McHugh. Good morning. First, in the Consulting business, the gross margin has continued to trend down. I think it peaked around 40% back in 2010, but has continued to move down since then. I'm guessing a lot of that's the strong growth that you've seen in managing partner and consultant head count, but was just curious if you think that could reverse at some point and trend back up or if you view kind of the lower gross margin as more of a permanent structural change in the business.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Stephen. Good morning. It's Craig. You're right. The primary driver of those reductions in gross contribution margin have been the investment in managing partners. We've been growing that very aggressively, well faster than revenue. The goal of making those investments though is so that we can drive deeper relationships with our largest clients where we're doing longer engagements and repeat engagements, and inherently those have better economics over the long-term.","So we continue to believe that this can be a 35% to 40% margin business for us and we manage it so that we \u2013 or we plan for it so that we do see modest margin improvements on a year-over-year basis. But again, the investment in MPs, we think is the real lever there for us to drive better, more consistent results for us and better, more valuable relationships for our clients.","Stephen H. Sheldon - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the pace of share repurchases, it was a little slower in the second half of the year, so just wanting to know how you're thinking about share repurchases as you move into 2016.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I mean we did over $0.5 billion of repurchasing in the year. Yes, it was heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, but we still did well over $500 million for the year. As we've talked about, share repurchases remain a strategic use of our cash flow and our balance sheet, and we'll continue to look at both share repurchases and acquisitions as the two primary uses. As we talked about, when we put the current authorization in place, we talked about it being a roughly 2.5 year to 3 year program, that's the way we still think about it.","Stephen H. Sheldon - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. Sorry to go back to the sales force productivity issue. I just wanted to clarify something. If we somehow or if you can take out the impact of the energy and utility sector, would your NCVI per AE have gone up in 2015?","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So we probably would have seen a very, very modest decline on a year-over-year basis.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","But that's not something you expect to continue going forward, correct?","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just to follow on that, which is, so the energy and utility sector is just the companies. If you look again, like I used Brazil since I've already talked about Brazil as an example. So in Brazil, because there \u2013 the whole economy has a lot of reliance on oil and gas \u2013 if the oil price goes down from $100 to $30 a barrel, it directly affects the oil companies but it affects government revenues; the government has less to spend. It affects all the companies that supply the oil companies. And so part of the factor we had was directly driven by the oil and gas sector itself. But the other thing is, if you're in a country like Brazil, it affects more than that.","And to put it in perspective again, I want to drive home that we didn't see shrinkage or anything. In fact, Brazil was growing a bit above our average double-digit growth last \u2013 in 2014. In 2015, it had double-digit growth a little below our average growth. So, even in that tough environment, we had great growth there. But again, if you go from higher double-digit growth to a little lower double-digit growth, that has an impact on productivity. So it's not that we have things that are going from like great growth to negative, it's the double-digit just isn't quite as good as it was. And so that's the other small piece of it.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's fair enough. I got that. And just to shift gears to the Events segment for a second. Was there an issue in terms of the size of the events this quarter? Your average attendee per event went down a bit. I know you had two more events but was there a mix shift or a timing issue? Thanks.","Craig W. Safian - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Our attendee growth in the quarter, Jeff, was 3%. I don't think you were in Orlando but, as you know, Orlando is our largest event where we actually sold it out for two years in a row. And so you don't see big attendee growth when we have a sell-out. We do see revenue growth because, again, we're attracting and targeting a higher quality of attendee and then we're able to get a higher price out of that. But no, no issue or no risk from the math you're doing. Q4 was a very strong quarter for us from an Events perspective and particularly from an attendee revenue growth perspective.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer of Gartner. Please proceed sir.","Eugene A. Hall - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I just returned from our annual kick-off meeting with our sales managers from around the world and our sales leaders are excited about our prospects for growth and feel well equipped for success in any economic condition. As a company, we're in a very strong position. We have more impact on end users and technology providers than any other company in the world, and we know how to be successful. The macroeconomic environment affects all companies, but Gartner is better prepared than ever to deal with these disruptions.","We're entering the year with the highest number of sales people than ever before. Our recruiting processes are better than ever, and all the leading indicators on our people suggest the talent we have in our organization today is better than it's ever been.

Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Shipman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond. This call will include a discussion of Q1 2013 financial results as disclosed in today's press release. After our prepared remarks, you will have an opportunity to ask questions.","I'd like to remind everyone that the press release is available on our website, and that URL is www.gartner.com.","Before we begin, we need to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as in other filings with the SEC. I would encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. The company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward-looking statements.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Gene?","Eugene A. Hall","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 earnings call. The continued effective execution of our proven strategy resulted in another quarter of double-digit growth. As we build momentum in 2013, we're well-positioned to deliver double-digit growth in our key financial metrics going forward.","The global macroeconomic environment in 2013 hasn't improved since we last spoke, and it continues to be difficult. In fact, it worsened in many areas. In this environment, we continue to see robust demand across the business for our services, and we delivered our 11th quarter in a row of double-digit contract value growth. Through Q1 in 2013, as we've consistently done over the past few years, we've delivered double-digit growth in contract value revenues.","As you'll hear in more detail from Chris, Gartner's performance remains strong. I'll share a few highlights.","Research, our largest and most profitable segment, continues to grow at double-digit rates, consistent with the growth trends we've seen in the past 3 years. We delivered 14% contract value growth, with all geographies, all client sizes and every industry segment growing at double-digit rates. Our retention rates remain high, with client retention, 82%; and wallet at 98%.","Our Events business continues to exceed our long-term growth rate target, with revenue growth of 20% over first quarter of 2012 excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","As you know, our Consulting business tends to be less consistent quarter-to-quarter than our Research business, yet we continue to see great demand. So our Consulting was slightly below expectations in Q1, our pipeline for Q2 looks solid and backlog remains at healthy levels. We expect the full year to be within the guidance we issued at the start of the year.","These results continue to illustrate the ongoing success of our strategy and the tremendous value we bring to our clients.","I recently spent a few days meeting with several hundred of our top performing sales associates. They are excited about our prospects for growth, even in this economy. Our sales associates consistently report that our clients value our services, whether they're growing or facing budget cuts.","We know how to build world-class sales capabilities, and we continue to invest in our sales force. This investment benefits from world-class recruiting, sales training and sales leadership. Our strong sales capabilities comes with world-class products and services, and our industry-leading analysts allows us to consistently deliver strong results.","I said this before, and it remains just as true today, these are remarkable times for technology. Technology is transforming the world, from governments and cities to banking, health care, agriculture, manufacturing and more. The nexus of forces, social computing, global computing, cloud computing and information is driving change on a scale seldom seen. Technology has transformed how we work and what we do, and it affects every industry. And Gartner is at the heart of it. Every company, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, large, medium, or small, and any government agency in the world is a potential client, giving us a vast untapped market opportunity for our services.","Gartner is the best source of help for enterprise leaders launching critical initiatives within this technology revolution. Our systems often make the difference between success and failure for our clients, and we're relevant whether the institution is growing or facing economic challenges.","The successful execution of the right strategy drives our consistent performance. As some of you know, the fundamentals of our strategy are to create extraordinary research insight, develop strong sales capability, deliver high-value differentiated offerings, to provide world-class service and to continue to improve our operational effectiveness. This time-tested strategy will allow us to maintain and sustained double-digit growth into the future.","I remain confident and excited about Gartner. The Gartner brand is in a class by itself; our products, services and people are superior to the competition; and we have a great business model; and we're relevant to virtually every company and government agency in the world.","In summary, I'd like to leave you 3 takeaways from today's call. First, we continue to see robust demand for our services. Our vast market opportunity and our consistent winning strategy allows to once again deliver double-digit contract value growth. Second, clients value our services, whether they're growing or facing difficult budget cuts. And third, we continue to be well-positioned to achieve sustained double-digit growth in our key metrics, as we've done in the past several years.","With that, I'd like to hand the call to Chris.","Christopher J. Lafond","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone.  As Gene mentioned, we're up to a strong start to 2013, with 14% growth in contract value and double-digit growth in total revenues in the first quarter. Our results continue to demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy and our ability to consistently deliver on the financial objectives we have communicated over the past several years.","We continue to see strong trends in our key business metrics during the first quarter. Year-over-year contract value growth remains strong, and retention rates ended at\/or near all-time highs. Our Events business increased by 20% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis, and our Consulting backlog increased in a seasonally light quarter.","Demand for our services remained strong across our 3 business segments, even if the companies face the uncertainties of the current macroenvironment, because we are a key partner for IT and supply chain professionals and running efficient and innovative programs to drive growth in the organizations, programs crucial to the success or failure of their strategic initiatives. We're engaged on the most important projects for the institutions we work with. And this is why the successful execution of our strategy -- with the successful execution of our strategy we continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance and also why we're so confident that 2013 will be another year of double-digit growth.","Let me now review each of our 3 business segments for the first quarter, starting with Research.  First quarter Research revenue was up 13% to $310 million. Currency fluctuations had no material impact on Research revenue. Contribution margin in this segment increased almost 70 basis points to 69.3% in the first quarter, as our strong execution continues to capitalize on the operating leverage in this business.","All of our key Research business metrics remained strong in the first quarter. Contract value grew to a record level of $1.269 billion, a growth rate of 14% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. As has been the case for the past several years, our growth in contract value in Q1 was extremely broad-based. And contract value grew at double-digit rates across every geography, client size and industry segment.","New business again increased year-over-year, continuing the trend we've seen since late 2009. The new business mix was balanced between sales and new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients.","While our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting, approximately 80% of our contract value growth came from volume, with the balance coming from price increases. We've consistently increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year on an annual basis since 2005. We implemented a price increase during the fourth quarter of 2012, and we expect to do so again in 2013.","Our volume growth reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients. As a result, we ended the quarter with 13,203 client organizations, up 7% over last year's first quarter. Our client retention rate ended the quarter at 82%, the same level as last year's first quarter, and we've maintained client retention at\/or near record-highs for 10 quarters in a row.","In addition to retaining our Research clients at an impressive rate, the clients we retained continued to increase their spending with Gartner, and wallet retention ended at 98% in the first quarter. Wallet retention is higher than client retention through a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we've discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a fourth quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in our Research segment. We grew our contract value by $151 million on an FX neutral basis year-over-year. We continue to see high levels of demand from clients, and we expect acceleration in contract value and revenue growth over time. We remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit annual revenue growth in this segment over the long-term.","Turning now to Events. Our Events segment started 2013 continuing the extremely strong year-over-year revenue growth we've delivered for the past 3 years. In the first quarter, Events revenue increased 19% year-over-year on an as reported basis and 20% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","During the first quarter, we held 12 events with 5,788 attendees compared to 13 events with 5,707 attendees in the first quarter of 2012. Approximately $2.2 million of the revenue increase was due to the 2 events that were moved into the quarter. We also had $1.6 million in additional revenues from the 10 ongoing events held in the quarter. On a same event basis, attendee revenue was up 16% and exhibitor revenue was up 19% year-over-year.","Q1 is our lightest quarter for the Events business, with the fewest number of events held. And as a result, relatively small changes in expense can impact the quarterly margin. The gross contribution margin for Q1 decreased as compared to 2012. This is related to a combination of factors, including higher operating expenses from the expansion of a major event and the move of 2 events to new venues.","Looking ahead, we see strong demand for both attendee and exhibitor participation at our upcoming events. For the full year, we expect this business to grow as we guided at the beginning of the year, continuing the trend of strong revenue growth, growth in contribution margin and margin expansion that we've seen over the past few years.","Moving on to Consulting. Our Consulting business tends to be less consistent quarter-to-quarter than our Research business. As Gene mentioned, we had a slower start to the year than we expected, with revenues in Consulting declining 3% on a reported basis in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenues decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, we're seeing good and steady demand for our consulting services.","Backlog is the leading key indicator of future revenue growth for the Consulting business, and we ended the quarter at $97.5 million. This represents 2% growth year-over-year and a healthy 4 months of backlog. Additionally, our pipeline looks equally solid as we entered the second quarter. With the current backlog and visibility we have into the pipeline, our full year revenue expectations for the Consulting segment remain unchanged.","Recall that our benchmark and core consulting practices delivered 6% FX neutral revenue growth in 2012. We're extremely careful in adding resources only to areas where we see consistent and strong demand. As a result, we began thoughtfully adding delivery resources in the second half of 2012. Prior to that, our consulting headcount was essentially unchanged since the end of 2010.","We continued adding resources in Q1 of this year, including the addition of 10 managing partners. With these additional resources, our utilization rates declined in Q1. And as a result, the gross contribution margin in this segment declined versus Q1 of 2012. We fully expect utilization to recover quickly as the new hires contribute given our strong backlog position.","Billable headcount of 528 was up 11% from the first quarter of 2012. First quarter utilization was 65%, down roughly 5 points from the prior year first quarter. And revenue per billable headcount ended the quarter at $404,000.","We remain confident in the full year expectations for this business, and we have the backlog and pipeline to deliver on the guidance we established at the start of the year. We still expect Consulting revenues to grow by 2% to 7% for the full year.","Moving down the income statement. SG&A increased by $18 million year-over-year during the first quarter. We continued to tightly control G&A costs across the entire company, and we continue to believe this expense item will provide us with a source of operating leverage in the future. SG&A will continue to decline as a percent of revenue.","The SG&A increase is primarily driven by the growth in our sales force. As of March 31, we have 1,461 quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 173 sales associates from 1 year ago.","Moving on to earnings. We delivered another quarter of solid earnings growth. Normalized EBITDA was $75 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, up 6% year-over-year. As we indicated when we gave our initial guidance, we expected Q1 to be our seasonally lowest earnings quarter.","Also as expected, our Q1 2013 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes $0.01 per share and amortization of the cost associated with our acquisitions, including Ideas International.","Turning to cash. Operating cash flow increased by 5% to $20 million in our seasonally smallest quarter of the year. In Q1 of each year, we see significant uses of cash with our annual bonus and yearend commission payments being made. Over the long term, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow substantially greater than our net income, given our tight cash management and the negative working capital characteristics of our Research business.","During the first quarter, we utilized our cash to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we repurchased almost $1 million shares at a total cost of approximately $49 million. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position with net cash of $64 million.","Our newly refinanced credit facility runs through March 2018 and at this time, provides us with about $550 million of remaining borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value.","We continue to look for acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We believe that repurchasing our shares also remains a compelling use of our capital, and we have $187 million remaining under our board authorization.","Let me finish with a discussion of our guidance for the year. As Gene mentioned, we're reiterating our guidance we laid out for you on our fourth quarter conference call back in February. The details are in the press release, but as a reminder, our guidance calls for a double-digit growth in revenue, normalized EBITDA, EPS and cash flow for the full year.","For the summarize, we delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Q1, our seasonally smallest quarter of the year. Demand for our services is strong and our key Research business metrics remained at our or near our all-time highs in the first quarter. Our initiatives to improve optional effectiveness, coupled with a positive operating leverage inherent in our business, delivered solid earnings growth and substantial cash flow. As always, we're actively exploring strategic alternatives for deploying our cash. And we'll continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we expect to repurchase shares throughout 2013.","Finally, the double-digit growth in contract value in the fourth quarter -- we continue to build a solid foundation for delivering strong revenue and earnings growth in 2013. We are well-positioned for double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing returns to our shareholders over the long term.","Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Tim McHugh, William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So first one, I'll just ask about the sales productivity. It looks like it was kind of flattish year-over-year. Was there any variance in that kind of by market? I know you said the revenue growth wasn't, but how should we think about sales productivity at this point?","Eugene A. Hall","Hey, Tim. It's Gene. So in -- when we laid out the guidance with you, one of the things we've said is we were assuming a flat macroeconomic environment around the world and no increase in sales productivity in our plan. And the -- if anything, the macroeconomic situation is worse. If you look at Europe, Europe has actually got the worst decline in last year, Asia's growth has slowed and the U.S. certainly has not accelerated. And so our sales productivity has been -- even in that environment, has been flat. And the -- if you look at it underneath the covers kind of what's going in different geographies, whatever, there's nothing really different going on there because we're getting pretty much, as I talked about, you got double-digit growth across every geography, across every industry segment and across every size of company. And so there's nothing kind of different that's happened in Q1 than in the past.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","When you say the -- just before the macro environment has worsened, are you talking -- I guess, based on your own interpretation of headlines and -- or are you talking more about feedback you hear from salespeople in the business?","Eugene A. Hall","No, just the what the stated -- so not our feedback from salespeople, but more the -- what you -- what the economic analyzers say. So look -- if you look at Europe, Europe's growth this year has been more negative than it was last year, and it's expected to continue that way. So it's not from our salespeople; it's from the economic experts. Our salespeople, again, it's -- I think from a salesperson's perspective, it's the same kind of environment. They see individual companies and\/or individual institutions, some of them were doing great in terms of their own growth, some of them have financial problems, and we can help any of those institutions. And so I think from a salesperson's perspective, it's kind of the same.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then on the Consulting business, I know last quarter -- or you had talked at least for last year how the contract optimization business was the source of weakness, but you saw good growth in kind of the remainder of the core benchmarking type of practice. Is that a similar distinction, or any color in terms of the sublines within Consulting?","Christopher J. Lafond","Hey, Tim. It's Chris. Just a couple of things. As -- if you recall what we had talked about around our Contract Optimization business going this year is, we assumed it would be flat to the prior year, and that's kind of how we're trending overall. And so, what we're really seeing is across the business, flat to slightly down across all of the businesses, and it's kind of consistent around the world. And as I said on my -- in my talk track, we've added quite a few delivery resources, getting them all up to speed, getting them all productive has put some pressure on the margin, some pressure on the utilization as we get all those people up to speed.  So we feel very comfortable that we've got a good strong backlog, that we're seeing continued demand across all those segments. And we will continue to deliver the results that we expected at the beginning of the year in that kind of 2% to 7% range.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And can you remind me the number of managing directors that the 10 -- I'm assuming that was kind of a net number, but 10 increase there. I'm trying to get a sense of how significant that is of a general [ph].","Christopher J. Lafond","We now have, with those additional 10, about 80 to 82 managing partners. So it was -- we've continued to invest there, as you know, over the past few years, and it was another nice step forward as we expected to. This year has been working for us really well. But bringing them in onboard takes a little bit of time to get them up to speed, but we feel very comfortable. We're still executing the strategy that makes good long-term sense both for the Consulting business and for the Research business as we continue to focus the selling activity inside of the consulting organization itself.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi, Janney Securities.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","My first question here is just on the sales force productivity. I know you'd given some rough parameters on what you're hiring plans were there, any changes in those plans? And maybe you can give us some update on what the sales force hires look like, I guess, at least through the first quarter.","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. So great question. So there's no change in our plan for hiring for the year. In fact, as -- Chris will go through this in a second, we actually accelerated our hiring in Q1.","Christopher J. Lafond","Yes. So, Joe, we increased our sales force by about 13% year-over-year; that's a little faster than we were last year. If you remember what we said last year, it was that as we saw productivity not improving as quickly as we wanted to, we kind of took a pause and looked at where that was happening and reallocated some resources. We feel very comfortable with what we're seeing. We started this year with the expectation that productivity would not improve given our expectations for the environment at a macro level. That's exactly what's happening. And so, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing, and as a result, we've begun to accelerate and fully expect that we'll be in that 15% to 20% range this year as we end the year.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then on the Consulting business, any change in the type of mix on the deal side? Or any change in decision-making, particularly on, I guess what we'd call, discretionary work?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, it's Gene. I'd say there's not any. I think the -- what you're seeing in the Consulting business is more just a normal variation from quarter to quarter. As Chris said, we don't expect any change for the full year. It's worth spending probably a minute and just talk about, reminding you about -- everybody about the strategic role consulting, which is -- the strategic role consulting is to help support our Research business. Let me elaborate for a second. So in our Research business, clients access research documents online we produce for analysts, in addition, begging to have our phone calls. There's -- and that's the primary way to deliver on our Research business. There's a set of our customers, particularly the very large institutions, that would like more in-depth help. And so, the reason we're in Consulting business is, for those clients that want that more in-depth help in areas that they're getting a research on. Our Consulting business provides a view for doing that, and so that's kind of a strategic role of the Consulting business. And so we're growing it. As you know, our objective is to grow it a bit slower than the other Research business. It's because that's the rate we think actually provides the best support to this Research business. The other thing is, which is really great, it supports the Research business, but it has really good margins, and has the -- so we're doing it at a very profitable rate as well. And so the -- we're not kind of in consulting, for its own sake; we're in consulting as part of integrated strategy with the Research businesses.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last one for me, just going back to your comments about the macro. That was clearly just directed towards the headlines. I mean, given your guidance and your reaffirmation of guidance, I assume that the macro hasn't changed from what you'd built into the original guidance, is that correct?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, that's correct. Exactly.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Chris, margins, down a little bit year-to-year, and I understand there's seasonal factors and obviously, the consulting Events business weigh on it. But does it cause you to rethink at all the expectations for margins either on a near-term basis or target for margins over the next couple of years?","Christopher J. Lafond","No, not at all. I think when you look at -- in the quarter, everything is trending as we would normally expect. So when you look at our Events business, doing incredibly great. And yes, the margins there, as I mentioned in my talk, were down, but we had expected that. We had expanded an event in a pretty significant way. We moved a couple events to new locations as we continue to grow those events. And often as you move events and effectively expand, which tends to be like relaunches, those margins tend to have a -- to be slightly lower initially and then grow, and that's exactly as we expected. So the margins, we expect, will come back, as we do with all the other events. So we know how to do this. We know how to launch events. We know exactly what the expectations are and they point -- they're running at exactly as we expected them to. So no issues at all on the Events side, and still expect a great year and continued margin expansion. As I mentioned, on the Consulting side, it was quite some time before we added resources. We had -- essentially had flat Consulting organizations since 2010, and so we'd not added resources quite some time other than adding managing partners. But even there, the overall headcount was only up very little bit. So we added some resources there. We fully expect utilization will come back. We have the backlog, the pipeline that we see, so we feel very comfortable there and still expect that, that business will -- margins will continue to expand. So overall, nothing we've seen in the quarter gives us any pause or a concern either for the year or over the long-term.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And then you also highlighted an expectation that you would get back to the 15% to 20% sales force growth by the end of the year. Should we read into that an expectation that we could see sequential acceleration in contract value growth as the year progresses?","Christopher J. Lafond","Well, Peter, what we said at the beginning of the year and we continue to say is, we fully expect that we will see that acceleration happen over time, and it's a question of when. As we said, this year, we didn't expect the economy to improve, we didn't expect sales productivity to improve. The environment is challenging, and the environment our companies are facing our challenging. We're still performing great. As you can see, we're still continuing to deliver 14% contract value growth, retention rates, all of our key metrics are at or near all-time highs, remaining on the trends we've seen. So we feel really good about what we're seeing, which is why we're continuing to pretty aggressively grow the sales force, and we'll continue to do that. And now, the question will be, as things start to stabilize in the world, hopefully, start to see acceleration. And as we also told you, we're not sitting around waiting for the world to stabilize. We're doing lots of different things in our business all the time to improve, to improve sales productivity, to improve how we operate, to improve what we do and deliver to our clients. And so we're going to continue to do those things. And it's our expectation that we will see that acceleration. I can't tell you it'll be next quarter or 3 quarters from now, but we fully expect it will come.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, Gene, you highlighted in your starting comments the strength across the portfolio in terms of end user markets, et cetera. Any in particular that you would call out in terms of areas where you're seeing a particular strength in terms of end user markets or geographies? And then sort of related to that, any comment in terms of sequestration, are you seeing any impact on your results from that?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, Peter. So in terms of particular markets, again, there's no new news there. As I said, we're seeing double-digit growth across everything, and so there's nothing different in Q1 about that. In terms of sequestration, as you know, we're a business that -- we know how to deal with institutions that are either doing well or not doing well and that have budget problems or no budget problems. And the -- this is not the first time that we've dealt with a federal government, or any government institution for that matter, that has sequestration -- has budget kinds of things. And we deal with this, not just for the U.S. Federal Government, but other governments all the time. We're used to -- we know what we're doing with it. In addition to that, as you know, we are highly diversified geographically and by industry, and so the combination of the two is the fact that we know how to deal with these situations. And the fact that we're so highly diversified by geography and by industry makes it so that it won't have a meaningful impact on us.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Eric Boyer, Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was just wondering, could you give us the core consulting growth x the contract optimization?  I think you said it was 6% for 2012, what was it in the quarter?","Christopher J. Lafond","Hold on one second, Eric, we'll get that. The -- yes, so it was -- if you look back last year, core and benchmarking was up 6% for the full year. It is effectively, I think, flattish year-over-year. So I think it's essentially a 0% growth in that business for the first quarter.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then did you see an acceleration within kind of the other areas x your contract optimization throughout the quarter into this quarter that kind of give you confidence that you think the consulting piece of the business is going to snap back here?","Christopher J. Lafond","What we saw, as I talked about, we saw a couple of things. We continued to see good bookings, which is why our backlog continues to remain strong. We still have 4 months of backlog. We saw a good demand around the entire world. So we didn't see dramatic differences in different parts of the world in terms of performance. So the pipeline looks really solid as well going forward into next year. So not only did we have good bookings in the quarter and good backlog, we have good pipeline looking forward. Q2 looks pretty solid for us. We brought a number of delivery people on and managing partners on, given the demand we saw. So for all those reasons, we feel very confident that we will continue to see that kind of growth expectation we've set at the beginning of the year. There's nothing we saw in our Q1 results, nothing we see in the forward-looking pipeline that suggests otherwise.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Any type of work or area that you're seeing particular strength in within Consulting? And then the resources that you're bringing on, where are those onboarding onto?","Christopher J. Lafond","I wouldn't necessarily say I think we've seen any dramatic change in the business from what we saw last year going into this year in terms of practice areas. One of the areas that always remained strong is our benchmark business. That's been a very solid business. In every environment, companies like to benchmark, so that business continues to be solid. We fully expect to see continued demand of Contract Optimization. As you know, that business can bounce around a bit, depending on when clients choose to engage in some of those larger transactions, but there's always a flow of activity there. So -- and we've added resources around the world; we've added resources in certain parts of Europe; we've added them in benchmark; and we've added them in the U.S. So we've been adding resources pretty broad-based, based on where we're seeing that. But again, it's not one little pocket. There's some pretty nice strength that we see in the backlog and in the pipeline.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then finally, any change that you're seeing in the sales force attrition rate as far as voluntary attrition?","Eugene A. Hall","So our sales attrition rate has gotten a little bit better.  But it's kind of, like, put it in the -- it's not like it's -- and we have very good sales attrition, and it just got a little bit better.  So I'd say, no real news, but if there's any -- if there were any news too, it's good news.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Mueler, Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I know this is a relatively small dollar amount, so I hate to keep beating this dead horse, but on Consulting, was it more of a client pause maybe around some of the macro and legislative uncertainty around yearend? Or was this more of a -- just an execution issue as you brought on some new people, you moved some people around as you brought on 10 new managing partners, was it more of a client issue or execution?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. Hi, Jeff. It's Gene. I'd put it actually to a different category, which is, the nature of our Consulting business is, you go negotiate a deal, and these things are -- when they start, et cetera, it depends on kind of the client's situation. And so it's just intrinsically more variable from quarter-to-quarter than if you look at something like our Research business, for sure. Even our Events business, we know -- when we have an event for the quarter, we know what kinds of things to expect. So Consulting projects will slip a little bit between one quarter and another quarter. And I look at this more as being just a normal variation to slippage from quarter to quarter. And as we said, as you look at our backlog, and our. Pipeline kind of supports that. As opposed to this something like it had to do with some macro factors, something like that.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So I think just a follow up then on the last question, so have you started to see those client situations, that variability, have they start -- the projects started in March and April, then?","Eugene A. Hall","We had a bunch of projects -- a bunch of business that came in, in April that might have come in, in March and happened to flip into April, absolutely. And so again, we're seeing we're on a pretty good track there.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then on Events, can you just help us with revenue growth? It looks like total number of attendees was just up slightly. Was this price increases on the events, was this some shifting in terms of the mix between higher and lower priced events?","Christopher J. Lafond","It's a combination of things. We've moved some events out of the quarter, some events into the quarter. So as we always do, we have a little bit of movement around. And so sometimes you see a big event move and a smaller one move in and vice versa.  We certainly did see some nice price increase and mix. So some of the events were different size, so the pricing on those events tends to be higher. So it's a combination of factors that drove the revenue and drive the performance, and it's -- we look at it and we look forward. We still feel very confident. Again, if you look at the same Event business, attendee revenue, up 16%; exhibitor revenue, up 19%. The prices are up as we would expect them to be, both from a mix perspective and just annual price increase. So everything is flowing as we expected.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, I hear you loud and clear that you continue to plan to repurchase stock.  I wanted to ask a question on the expected pace of repurchases borrowing, some sort of big M&A deal, but asking that in the light of now, you have a net cash positioning, you just locked down some pretty good credit facilities that extend out for good duration, so would you expect to step up the pace of repurchases relative to what you guys have done in the last couple of years?","Christopher J. Lafond","As you know, we tend to be pretty aggressive in share repurchase. If you look back over a number of years, we've spent quite a bit of money on share purchase, and we will continue to do that. We tend to be in the market regularly, but also, try to be opportunistic where we can be. So we try to do the best we can in terms of the timing of our share repurchases, but we will continue to be aggressive. And as you just mentioned, we took advantage of the current credit markets to lengthen and expand our credit facility so we have plenty of capacity for both acquisitions and share repurchase. And we fully expect both will be things that we will do over time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee, Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, the first question, how do you think about and how do you focus the sales force on trying to increase the number of seats at existing large customers versus adding new customers? And is one of those easier or more difficult in a more challenged economic environment like we're in today?","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. So the -- we - it's a good question. We basically ask our salespeople to do both. Most of our salespeople have an existing client base, and we have a whole set of programs and strategies to support our salespeople. They're designed to increase the number of seats at existing clients. We actually track it pretty carefully, and that's going very well. Similarly, we have a set of programs that are designed to continue to grow the number of new clients as well. So we think we need to have a balance of new clients, as well our growing -- our existing clients. Both of those sets of programs are working very well. There's the -- as I mentioned before, the way that we think about it is not in the macroeconomic environment, but what's going on in the individual company level. And whether a company is doing really well or whether a company is under severe financial pressure, we have the ability to help them, and clients understand we're able to help them. And so we don't have any problem either adding seats or in selling new clients, even in very difficult macroeconomic situations. I mean, even in very difficult individual company situations, in fact, just as an example, I talked last year how Spain has one of the worst economic environments in the world, and we had very good double-digit growth in Spain. I could give you several other markets of the same kind of way. And so we're not -- we have -- it's -- selling to a new client is important, selling to existing -- more existing clients is important. We have progress in both of those, and we know how to sell both situations in whether the company or institution is doing well or whether they have all kinds of cost pressures.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And are there any particular areas of strength or weakness in terms of demand within the Consulting business? You continue to say you're seeing broad-based strength or demand everywhere. And I guess, it -- 3 of the last 4 quarters, Consulting revenue has fallen year-over-year. It just doesn't really -- it doesn't really necessarily tie with some of the other commentary you gave.","Christopher J. Lafond","So when you look at our Consulting business from the perspective of, is there a change in the trendline in terms of where the demand is, and the answer to that is no. There's no individual place that I would say is dramatically different as we sit here in Q1 today than we saw last year. So if you look at each of the 3 major segments, as we've talked about repeatedly, our Contract Optimization business tends to be a bit lumpy, and it tends to be when clients choose to exercise those deals and choose to move ahead and execute on a big transaction; that can vary. And it varies not only with clients' but at vendors' yearends. And so there's lots of reasons that business varies, but I would say we're not seeing versus what we saw last year. We expected that business to be relatively flat year-over-year. We're not seeing any indication that, that's any different, so we fully expect that to be relatively flat for the full year. When you look at our benchmark business, that business tends to be fairly consistent year-over-year. It had a really good strong year last year. People do like to benchmark in all economic environments. It's something that continues to be a good strong demand for clients. And then our core consulting business, which has a number of different practice areas around the world, and then a lot of different industries were seeing relatively consistent demand. As I said there, it's flat year-over-year, so nothing dramatically different from what we saw in Q1 of last year. So that's kind of what we're seeing right now. We certainly have seen backlog, as Gene talked about, some of that backlog is backlog that will be run out over a longer period of time, so back out -- into the back half of this year. But we have good solid backlog. We still see good pipeline, and the pipeline that we're seeing suggests everything I just talked about will continue in that Consulting business.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just lastly, are there -- what types of things would you look to acquire?  Is it more geography, are there holes in the prior -- probably not holes, but extensions that seem obvious to you to the existing product line? How do you think about what would be on the type of transaction you'd be looking for?","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. I guess, we've done 3 transactions in the last 9 years, and I think that's a pretty good indicator of the kind of things that we look at. And so I think you've -- I'm sorry, 4 transactions. And if you look at those, they all had a common theme to them, which is that they had products that were highly complementary to Gartner; they were syndicated research-type products. And so I think, you could look -- our history is a good guide for how we think about acquisitions.","Operator","There are no further questions, so I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Shipman for closing remarks.","Brian Shipman","Great. Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for your interest in Gartner, and we'll speak to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you for joining today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","Sherief Hassan Bakr - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner's first quarter 2017 earnings call. I'm Sherief Bakr, Head of Investor Relations at Gartner. With me today in Stanford is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.","This call will include a discussion of Q1 2017 financial results as disclosed in today's press release, as well as our updated outlook for 2017. After our prepared remarks, you'll have an opportunity to ask questions. In addition to today's press release, we have provided an accompanying presentation as a reference point for investors and analysts. Both the press release and presentation are available on our website, investor.gartner.com.","Now before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2016 report \u2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as other filings with the SEC. I would encourage all of you to review these risk factors listed in these documents.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Gene?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our Q1 2017 earnings call. We had a great first quarter in 2017. The positive momentum we had in Q4 continued into Q1, and we continue to delivering incredible value to our clients. We, once again, delivered double-digit growth in revenues and contract value. In addition, we recently closed our acquisition of CEB, which I'll talk more about in a moment.","I remain extremely excited about our business, our prospects for growth, and our strategy to drive long-term growth and value for our shareholders. We do business in more than 90 countries around the world. Because of ongoing currency fluctuations globally, we're going to talk about our results in FX-neutral terms, so you can have a clear understanding of how we're doing.","For the first quarter of 2017, total company revenues increased by 13%, and EBITDA increased by 3%. Research is the core of our business and our largest and most profitable segment. Research revenues grew 15% in the first quarter. These results were driven by strong contract value growth and contributions from our recent acquisitions.","Contract value growth for the first quarter of 2017 was also 15%. We achieved a double-digit contract value growth in every region, across every size company, and in virtually, every industry. Client retention was 83%, and wallet retention was 104%, near all-time high.","In Consulting, we continued to deepen our research relationships with our largest clients and deliver great value. For Q1 2017, our Consulting business grew 2%. We grew the number of managing partners 14%, consistent with our long-term growth plan, and we have full four months of backlog, which is in line with our operational target.","Events drove a strong start to the year with 11% growth in the first quarter 2017. We hosted more than 9,000 attendees, which is also up 11% year-over-year on a same-events basis. Leading indicators for our Events are very positive. Advanced bookings continue to grow at strong rates.","These results reflect strong demand for our services, the tremendous value we deliver and the operational excellence we're known for. Operationally, we're the strongest we've ever been, and the CEB acquisition is a perfect example. After announcing our intent to acquire CEB in early January, we completed the acquisition on April 5, 2017. This aggressive schedule was achieved through operational excellence, while simultaneously delivering a very strong quarter in the Gartner business.","The combination of Gartner and CEB will create tremendous value. This value will come from three main drivers. First, CEB expands our ability to help executives deal with unprecedented levels of disruption and change in our rapidly evolving world. Secondly, the addition of CEB will allow us to help clients and functions across the enterprise. In every enterprise, mission-critical priorities are accomplished by teams.","To help our clients with their mission-critical priorities, we need to be able to address functions across the business, not just in individual functional silos. CEB has traditionally been strong in areas such as HR, sales, finance and legal. Gartner's traditionally been strong with IT, supply chain and marketing. Our combined company will help enterprise-wide, cross-functional teams address their mission-critical priorities.","Finally, Gartner and CEB together will add more value and provide even more powerful insights than either company could have done alone. Gartner is world-class at analyst-driven research and advice. CEB is world-class in member based research and best practice case studies. The combination of member based research and case studies with analyst-driven research and advice would deliver more value to our clients than what either company could do individually. It's a perfect case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.","Now that we've owned CEB for about a month, I'm excited to report that we continue to be excited about the opportunity for strong value creation. Gartner and CEB associates are equally excited about the incredible opportunity this presents to have a positive impact on our client success.","2020 will be the third full year after acquisition. We continue to expect that by 2020, we'll see an attractive double-digit growth for both the CEB and the Gartner businesses. In addition, as Craig will detail in a moment, this deal is immediately accretive in the first year, and we expect to be double-digit percent accretive in 2018. I'm confident about our future prospects for growth as a combined company and remain excited about our near-term performance.","And with that, I'll hand the call over to Craig.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Because of the tremendous value we provide to our clients around the world, the investments we are making to capture our vast market opportunity, our focus on strong operational execution and our exceptional business model, we delivered yet another quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth.","On an FX-neutral basis, our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included total company revenue growth of 13%, contract value of 15%, Research revenue growth of 15%, Events revenue growth of 11%, Consulting revenue growth of 2%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 1%, and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.60 per share, which was towards the top end of our guidance range for the quarter.","Our exceptional business model continues to create a consistently high level of free cash flow conversion. On a rolling four-quarter basis, our free cash flow conversion was 126% of normalized net income.","I'll now discuss our first quarter business segment and P&L in depth before turning to our balance sheet and cash flow dynamics. I'll then provide some high-level comments on CEB's first quarter performance before closing with remarks on our updated 2017 guidance, which includes the expected contribution of CEB for the balance of the year. We will then be happy to take your questions.","In addition to my comments, today's press release and our 10-Q, I would encourage you to refer to the presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. The presentation provides an in-depth overview of our Q1 performance by business segment, covering some of the ground that I normally would cover in my prepared remarks. Given that I will spend more time covering the CEB acquisition and our updated outlook, this should still allow sufficient time for your questions, as well as providing a useful reference point for investors and analysts.","Beginning with Research; Research revenue grew 15% on both a reported and FX-neutral basis in the first quarter. Acquisitions had a one-point impact on Research revenue growth for the quarter. The gross contribution margin for Research was 69%, a one-point decline compared to the first quarter of 2016. Our other Research business metrics also remain very strong, and we continue to see robust demand for our services across the globe.","Total contract value was $1.95 billion as of the end of Q1, FX-neutral growth of 15% versus the prior year. For reference and comparison, our Q1 2016 total contract value at current year FX rates was $1.7 billion. The Q1 2017 measure includes the contribution of L2, an industry-leading marketing company that benchmarks the digital performance of brands, which we acquired in March.","Excluding L2, total contract value growth would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, consistent with the 14% growth we delivered last quarter. We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth in new business.","As Gene mentioned, client retention was 83%, down 40 basis points from the first quarter of 2016 and essentially flat on a sequential basis. Wallet retention ended at 104% for the quarter, down by less than a point year-on-year and flat on a sequential basis. Both of our retention figures are close to our historical highs.","In Q1, we had an unusually large number of renewals impacted by M&A. Had we experienced a normal level of renewals impacted by M&A, we would have seen an improvement in our retention metrics in Q1. As we look to the balance of the year, we anticipate a more normal level of this type of activity.","New business growth remained strong, up 13% year-on-year in Q1. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. And as always, we also benefit from our consistent price increases.","Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity, with both new and existing client enterprises. We ended the first quarter with 11,166 enterprise clients, up 7% compared to Q1 2016. The average spend for enterprise also continues to grow. It now stands at $175,000 per enterprise, up 8% versus prior year on an FX-neutral basis. This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth through both new and existing enterprises.","Turning to sales productivity, over the rolling four quarters, we delivered $256 million of FX-neutral net contract value increase. When divided by our beginning of period head count, which was our Q1 2016 ending head count of 2,237, our rolling four quarter productivity per account executive was $114,000, an increase of 8% year-on-year and 9% sequentially.","Excluding the impact of the L2 acquisition and therefore, making the metric directly comparable to the Q4 calculation, sales productivity was essentially flat on both a year-on-year and sequential basis. Q1 productivity was also impacted by the uptick in renewals with M&A that I referenced earlier. With a more normal level of M&A, we would have seen a sequential and year-on-year improvement in our productivity measures.","As always, we remain highly focused on improving our sales productivity and remain confident that the initiatives we have implemented drive productivity will positively impact our results over both the short and long term. To sum up, it was another strong quarter for our largest and most profitable segment. And as you'll see from our updated outlook, we continue to target another year of mid-teens growth.","Moving to Events; Events revenues were up 11% on an FX-neutral basis in Q1. On a same-events and FX-neutral basis, Events revenues increased by 6% year-on-year in the first quarter. Q1 is typically a smaller quarter for our Events business and we held 11 Events in Q1, one less than in the prior year quarter.","On a same-events basis, attendees were up 11% versus last year. Events Q1 gross contribution margin was 38%, down by approximately 200 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016. This was primarily due to higher year-on-year investments to support our growth strategy in a seasonally light quarter. In summary, we had a strong Q1 in our Events business. Our outlook remains unchanged. We still expect double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis for the full year.","Turning to Consulting; on an as-reported basis, first quarter Consulting revenues were flat year-on-year and increased by 2% on an FX-neutral basis, coming off a very strong Q1 last year. On the labor-base side, billable head count of 650 was up 5%, and we had 125 managing partners at the end of Q1, a 14% increase over the year-ago quarter.","Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $103 million, down 9% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis. As we noted last quarter, our Consulting backlog benefited in 2015 and the early part of 2016 from a very large contract booking in a non-target geography, which was a significant driver of backlog improvement in Q1 2016.","Excluding this one large contract, Consulting backlog decreased by 4% year-on-year. This represents approximately four months of forward backlog, which is in-line with our operational targets for this measure. Consulting gross contribution margin declined by 140 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to a modestly lower utilization but was up strongly on a sequential basis. For the full year, we continue to target Consulting revenues growth of 2% to 7% on an FX-neutral basis, in-line with our long-term growth target range of 3% to 8%.","Moving down the income statement; SG&A increased by 18% year-over-year in the first quarter. In normalized terms, our SG&A increased by 16% year-over-year. As we detailed on our Q1 2016 call, our Q1 results were positively impacted by lower stock compensation expense related to changes to the executive team. This resulted in approximately $5 million of SG&A savings in Q1 2016. That was a nonrecurring benefit. In addition, the phasing of our SG&A investments for 2016 were more backend loaded, making our Q1 2017 compare a bit tougher.","Staying with SG&A, our sales force continues to be our largest investment, and as of the end of the first quarter, we had 2,460 quota-bearing sales associates. This is an increase of 223 or 10% from a year ago. This is lower than our base level assumption for the full year, primarily due to the timing of our training academies. On a normalized basis, our quota-bearing sales growth was around 11.5%, and we continue to plan for approximately 13% sales head count growth in 2017.","Moving on to EBITDA and earnings; adjusted EBITDA was $106 million in the first quarter, meeting our Q1 EBITDA expectation. Adjusted EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% on an FX-neutral basis, as top-line growth was partially offset by the higher SG&A spend, I just referenced.","Moving down the income statement; depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter reflecting capital spending to support our growth, while acquisition and integration charges increased by almost $5 million. Depreciation charges increased year-over-year and the quarter reflecting capital spending, while acquisition and integration charges increased by almost $5 million, primarily related to the CEB acquisition and to a lesser extent, L2 \u2013 sorry about that.","Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.9%, which is approximately 1 point lower than the guidance of approximately 26% we gave three months ago. The tax rate was lower than guidance in large part due to a projected favorable impact of earnings mix and the timing of certain costs. Adjusting for acquisition charges, our normalized tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% and is also lower than our previously issued guidance of approximately 27% for largely similar reasons to the reduction in the GAAP rate.","GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.43 in the first quarter. Our GAAP EPS figure also includes $0.17 worth of acquisition and integration charges, approximately $0.04 higher than we had guided. The higher charges were due to the rapid closing of both of our announced acquisitions.","Adjusted EPS was $0.60 per share in Q1, down 10% versus Q1 of 2016. As mentioned earlier, our adjusted EPS was towards the higher end of our Q1 guidance. So we are right where we targeted to be coming out of Q1. The year-on-year growth rate was, obviously, impacted by our Q1 2016 adjusted EPS, which as you may recall, was up 65% last year.","Turning now to cash; in Q1, operating cash flow was an outflow of $30 million compared to a $13 million inflow in the year-ago quarter. The first quarter is seasonally the lightest quarter for the year in terms of cash flow, given the combination of seasonality in our operations, as well as the timing of incentive payments. Additionally, we announced the CEB deal during the first week of January. It's normal for clients to pause their purchasing cycles when there is M&A amongst their vendors, as they look to see if there are any benefits they can extract. In fact, that's what we advise our clients to do in many similar situations.","Our new business bookings accelerated over the course of the first quarter, culminating in an exceptionally strong March. Because of that timing, some of the cash that we normally would have collected in Q1 will now be collected in Q2. This impacted our Q1 cash flow figures.","Q1 2017 capital expenditures were $11 million, and Q1 cash acquisition and integration payments were $18 million. This yields free cash outflow of $23 million. This compares to Q1 2016 free cash flow of $18 million. The year-on-year changes primarily driven by the timing of contract value growth in the quarter and the related collections, as I just described, higher incentive payments, higher CapEx and higher acquisition and integration payments.","Turning to the balance sheet, we had a busy quarter related to the CEB acquisition, successfully securing an attractive financing package, which I'll detail a bit later. Given that the acquisition closed just after the end of Q1, I will focus my comments on our post-closing balance sheet rather than the March 31st snapshot.","Relative to the $703 million of gross debt we had at the end of 2016, our gross debt increased by approximately $2.9 billion related to the acquisitions of CEB and L2. In total, we had approximately $3.6 billion of gross debt as of April 5, comprising of the following: $1.485 billion of term loan A; $500 million of term loan B; $545 million drawn on our revolver; $800 million of high-yield bonds; and $300 million of bridge financing.","Slide 11 of the presentation on the Investor Relations site details our debt schedule and the respective interest rate. In addition to the new debt instrument, we have also increased the amount of interest rate swaps to lock in the interest rates of a significant portion of our floating debt. In total, we have $1.4 billion of hedges in place. Adding in the $800 million of high-yield bonds, more than 60% of our gross debt has a fixed interest rate.","At the time of the announcement of the CEB acquisition in early January, I noted that we expected the average interest rate to be between 4.25% and 5%. Due to a more favorable mix of lower-priced debt and better pricing on all debt tranches, our weighted average interest rate, including the cost of hedging, is approximately 4%. From a net debt perspective, we had approximately $3 billion of net debt upon closing, consistent with what we expected in January, which translates to approximately 4.3 times leverage on a pro forma combined last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA.","Turning now to some high level comment on CEB's Q1 performance, as we didn't own CEB until early Q2, the following results are what CEB would have reported as an independent company for the first quarter of 2017. CEB would've reported total adjusted revenues of $214 million and adjusted EBITDA of $36 million. Using CEB's methodology, constant currency CEB segment contract value growth was down about 1% year-over-year, while constant currency CEB segment wallet retention was 89%, flat year-on-year, but up by more than 1 point sequentially.","As with any large acquisition, we are in the process of harmonizing accounting treatments, calculation methodologies and purchase accounting. We'll report back to you any changes or adjustments on our Q2 earnings call in August.","Turning to guidance, slide 15 of the presentation gives you our high level outlook for 2017 based on 12 months of Gartner plus nine months of contribution from CEB. In addition, the slides detail the most significant below the line items to help you with your model. As is our practice, our EPS guidance is on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. However, given that the CEB transaction closed only a month ago, please note that our GAAP estimates are likely to be subject to change as we complete purchase accounting and further refine our estimates for other GAAP-related expenses.","We will also be providing you with guidance for both GAAP revenue and adjusted revenue. The only difference is the deferred revenue fair value adjustment as required as a part of purchase accounting for business combinations.","Gartner's revenue guidance is largely unchanged. We have adjusted up Research revenues modestly to reflect the L2 acquisition. For CEB, we expect GAAP revenues of between $519 million and $549 million for the nine months of 2017. Excluding the estimated deferred revenue fair value adjustment of $209 million, we expect adjusted revenues of between $728 million and $758 million for the balance of the year. In addition, we expect adjusted EBITDA of between $190 million and $205 million. This equates to a combined company adjusted revenue range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion and an adjusted EBITDA range of $685 million to $735 million for 2017.","Again, I'd remind you that these figures are for nine months of CEB results. To arrive at the relevant full year adjusted revenue and EBITDA figures for 2017, you can just add the first quarter performance numbers that CEB would've reported, which I detailed earlier.","On a GAAP basis, our 2017 earnings per share is expected to be significantly impacted by acquisition-related accounting and integration charges, of which the vast majority are noncash in nature.","Slide 16 of the presentation reconciles the per share differences between our updated GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. The after-tax impact of acquisition and integration adjustments, such as the fair value deferred revenue adjustment and incremental amortization and integration charges, totals approximately $4.42 per share at the midpoint and is detailed on slide 16 as well.","Putting this all together, we expect adjusted EPS of between $3.32 and $3.60 per share. When compared to our previous standalone adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.15 to $3.35 per share, this represents between 5% and 7% accretion for 2017. While it is too early to provide specific 2018 guidance, we continue to target double-digit accretion to our adjusted EPS.","Slide 22 details the key assumptions below EBITDA that we have used to calculate our updated adjusted EPS outlook. We expect the total cost associated with stock-based compensation expense in 2017 to be approximately $67 million to $68 million. Total depreciation should be approximately $69 million to $70 million, and amortization should be approximately $196 million, inclusive of the amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $112 million, which includes approximately $90 million of incremental expense for the balance of the year.","For our tax rate, we are projecting an annual effective rate for GAAP of approximately 33% to 34% and for adjusted earnings of approximately 32% to 33%. Please note that our full year GAAP actual tax rate may also change based upon final purchase accounting. Our tax rate may also vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the projected geographic mix of earnings, the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to stock-based awards, as well as the timing of certain items.","Finally, our EPS guidance is based on a weighted average fully diluted share count of approximately 89.5 million to 90.5 million shares for the full year 2017. This incorporates the additional 7.4 million shares issued in conjunction with the transaction. The 89.5 million to 90.5 million share estimate is a weighted average fully diluted share count, which has one quarter pre-acquisition and three quarters post-acquisition. We'd expect to exit 2017 with approximately 92 million shares outstanding.","Turning to our cash flow guidance, similar to GAAP EPS, our 2017 operating cash flow is expected to be significantly impacted by charges related to the CEB acquisition as well as incremental interest expense. The details and components of our cash flow guidance are also contained on slide 15.","For free cash flow, we now expect to generate between $335 million and $365 million in 2017. Free cash flow is based on operating cash flow guidance of $315 million to $345 million, capital expenditures of $95 million to $105 million, and cash acquisition and integration payments of $115 million to $125 million. And again, this is assuming 12 months of Gartner and nine months of CEB. This also obviously has the impact of significantly higher cash acquisition charges and interest expense payments.","It is worth noting that CEB's strongest free cash flow quarter has historically been Q1. This was true in 2017 as well. What you see in our combined free cash flow guidance reflects 12 months of Gartner and nine months of CEB, but excluding CEB's strongest quarter.","If we looked at free cash flow on a pro forma combined 12-month basis, we estimate that the guidance range would be $415 million to $445 million and adjusted net income to free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 140%. While the timing of the deal has impacted the 2017 cash flow guidance, we did acquire a larger cash balance than we anticipated, which we are able to utilize for our strategic initiatives.","Turning to our Q2 guidance, for the second quarter of 2017, we expect GAAP EPS of between negative $1.12 and negative $1.04. This includes approximately $1.91 per share of non-GAAP adjustment. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.80 and $0.85 for the second quarter 2017.","In closing, we had a strong start to the year, and we expect this performance to continue throughout the balance of 2017. Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth, and contract value growth was 15%. Our Events business is back on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017, and Consulting delivered another quarter of growth, following a very strong year-ago quarter.","From a standalone Gartner perspective, our 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook is largely unchanged, and we expect to continue our trend of double-digit growth. The addition of CEB further strengthens our ability to capture the vast market opportunity ahead of us as we are now able to address the mission-critical priorities of virtually all functional business leaders across every industry and size of enterprise worldwide.","On an adjusted basis, the acquisition of CEB is expected to be immediately accretive with between 5% and 7% accretion in 2017. We also continue to expect double-digit percentage adjusted EPS accretion in 2018 and remain confident in our ability to generate long-term double-digit growth with strong free cash flow conversion.","I'll now turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. This comes from the line of Anj Singh at CSG. Please go ahead.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on closing the deal. For the first question, I'm just hoping you can discuss some of the assumptions underlying your projections of CEB. It seems like you're not baking in too much of an improvement in revenue versus, say, where consensus was, perhaps a little lighter on EBITDA. It would just be helpful to get some context of how you're thinking about the changes you may be making under the hood this year?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yes. Hi, good morning. It's Gene. So with CEB, we closed the deal about a month ago. And during 2017, what we'll be focused on is making operational improvements that are going to accelerate growth in 2018 and beyond. And so I think that's kind of what you can expect from our basic plan. And those operational improvements are things like new seat-based products that combine the best of both research that I talked about earlier. Things like accelerating sales force growth. Things like integrating service processes \u2013 improving service processes to strengthen retention and of course, integrating our back office processes like how people get paid and things like that, the basic of business. And so 2017 is really going to be focused on building the foundation we need for accelerated growth in 2018 and beyond.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And, Anj, as you know, a large portion of CEB's revenues, are subscription-related. The revenue, in a sense, it doesn't get locked, but it gets close to locked based on where they finish 2016. 2017 is really a transition year is the way to think about it. As Gene mentioned, we're laying all the groundwork, so that we can accelerate growth in years beyond. We won't be satisfied if we don't see operational improvements over the course of the year. But given the revenue recognition nature, we'll probably see those benefits flow through in 2018 and beyond.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Understood. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, with regards to standalone Gartner, could you speak to the selling environment as it relates to the productivity? Is it having any dampening impact that you would call out? Perhaps if you can just give us a sense of what the improvement in productivity may have been if you had to adjust for that M&A impact? And I may have missed it, but what is your expectation for how long the M&A activity may impact some of your KPI?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yes, so the selling environment has been, I'd say, the same over the last couple of quarters. We've seen very robust demand for our products. As we mentioned last year, we saw an acceleration in Q4 in demand for our products that continued into Q1. Contracts come up for renewal based on what the client originally bought. Companies do get acquired. This happens all the time, of course, it's normal. And it just happened that an unusually large number of contracts came up for renewal where there were large M&A. And I'm not going to name the companies. But it's names you would know. So they came for renewal. So we have visibility of these. As we look through the rest of the year, we don't see that happening. To the point that Craig mentioned earlier, and we mentioned, our sales \u2013 all of our key metrics would have been up modestly if we'd had a normal quarter for M&A.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about two of the strategies that you talked about in terms of how you can improve the operations at CEB. First of all, on the client engagement and retention process that you've used, what's a realistic timeline as to when or how quickly you can implement some of those processes and how you think about when that might actually show up in their numbers?","And the second one, as part of that, Gene, I think one of the critical decisions you made in your early years in Gartner was to move the company forcefully to the seat license model. Is that an opportunity throughout big portions of CEB's business in the next couple of years? Or is the business different enough that just maybe more no discounting is the way we should think about the price discipline you can implement here? Thank you.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, on the client engagement and retention, we have developed to set up automated tools as well as people-based tool \u2013 people-based approaches designed to strengthen retention. As we look at CEB, we've done analysis that helps us understand the impact those are going to have. It will have the exact same impact with Gartner, as we look at those. And so we're going to be not implementing those tools in a Big Bang, but in an iterative process over a period of time, that we've already started with. And so this process is started and we'll keep doing that.","As such, I'd say you can \u2013 and then you implement the tools and then the renewal has to come up. So the clients that we're going to be affecting, their renewals are going to come up next year. They're not going to come up this year. And so you can sort of see we'll be making the improvements in engagement now. Those tools and new people processes will be implemented over time. But you'll start to see the impact as we get renewals really in 2018 and beyond.","With regard to the seat model, so it's our intention to introduce, as I mentioned in my comments, a whole set of new products that are seat-based. And over a period of time, we expect that all of CEB's product line for new clients will be transitioned to a seat-based product. The first of those seat-based products is due to be introduced again for new clients in midsummer. And then we will again, on a kind of iterative basis, keep upgrading all their products to be seat-based products, which we think add more value to clients than kind of an enterprise kind of product.","And so you'll see those products, especially, I said, first for new clients, and then we're going to go back to \u2013 these products will be better than the existing products because it will have kind of the best of both the CEB and Gartner. So not only the only thing new clients will be able to buy, we'd also \u2013 we did this with Gartner as well, go back to existing clients, and say, hey, you can keep the old price if you really like it, but we have this new product that has additional more value to it and if you want to upgrade, you can upgrade to that. And it will have the new terms. So, it will be discounted, the pricing, it will be seat-based, et cetera.","And so given what I just said, both the client engagement improvement as well as the transition to the new seat-based products with the best of both research, will start this summer and will continue on and then \u2013 and so the impact \u2013 you'll see the impact over time, really beginning and throughout 2018.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tim McHugh at William Blair. Please go ahead.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Just on CEB again, two questions, I guess, one is can you give us some comments on turnover? And then I guess how \u2013 is there any noise that's been created in that regard since the merger or leading up to the merger to the best you can tell? And secondly, just Craig, maybe on the EBITDA, I guess for Q1, it would seem to be down quite a bit for CEB versus what they at least reported last year. I don't know if it's comparable or not. But can you give any color on that? Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Tim, it's Gene. Were you talking about associate turnover?","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Well, all levels, I guess, other than planned to kind of cost synergies that you're catching up?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","As opposed to clients, you're talking about are...","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Yeah \u2013 no, internal staff, yes.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yes. So, internal staff turnover at CEB is substantially higher than Gartner's has been before the acquisition was announced. It hasn't accelerated since then. And one of our objectives is to get that turnover to Gartner levels. As I mentioned in my comments, the associate, the employees at \u2013 the associates at CEB, overall, are extremely excited about joining Gartner. It's a growth company. They know the brand. They know the company really well. It's not something they don't know. And we have a great reputation in the market \u2013 in the marketplace for hiring, et cetera.","And so \u2013 and then on top of that, since we closed the deal and even before, we've been going out and making sure that all of the associates at CEB understand this is about growth and turning CEB into an exciting growth company, which will provide great career opportunities for all of the CEB associates. And that message is getting out there. And so, well, one of the things that happens with M&A acquisition is recruiters go after the associates of the company to be acquired, telling them all the best that's going to happen. I think so far we've been very successful in providing that and I would expect as we go into again 2018, we'll see that associate turnover drop down to more like Gartner levels.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Thanks, Gene. And Tim, on the Q1 performance question, I'd note a couple of things. Number one, it's a pretty light quarter from a revenue perspective. And you have situations like Evanta which is a double impact, so really no revenues in Q1. But their expense base is there. And then also last year, the acquisition of Evanta didn't happen until Q2. And so we've got the grow-over problem of expenses that weren't in there last year, plus the revenue doesn't really start coming in until Q2. There's also, as you can probably see from the revenue, a decline year-over-year on revenues of about $9 million, that's also flowing through. And that's really based upon the contract value performance that you saw over the course of 2016, now feathering into the revenue recognition.","And then lastly, we did a little bit of \u2013 or they did a little bit of harmonization with our expense accrual methodologies, and that also had an impact on profitability. But what I'd say is they landed where we expected them to land in the first quarter. And then the other thing I'd say is operationally, it was encouraging to see sequential improvement, albeit modest but a sequential improvement in wallet retention on that for CEB segment CV.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. The next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik at Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on closing the deal as well. My first question was, Gene, you talked about all those retention tools you're going to put in place, and then you also talked about how the strategic value gives you the synergies across the enterprise functions, providing change inside, et cetera. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, you guys have been always good at the wallet retention metric. Does the combination potentially help improve that client retention that has been 83%, 84%, which feels like should be a lot higher?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yes. So I think, yes, it will improve. Again, over time, it will improve our \u2013 it should improve our client retention. And the reason is that again, we'll be in more functions in each of the businesses. And if your company's enterprises get things done by teams, across functional teams, you can help across those teams, that's going to give you higher client retention. The other thing I just mentioned too, let's keep in mind this, our client retention \u2013 there's a couple of things that affect client retention that are structural. One is there's a \u2013 we cannot \u2013 a big company and a little company with client retention is the same. So Gene's Pizza Parlor and ExxonMobil are both counted as one enterprise and the smaller companies like Gene's Pizza Parlor grow out of business a lot more. And so there's a portion, we talked about this in the past, there's a portion of our client retention, which is the Gene's Pizza Parlor of the world, the smaller companies that are going out of business.","The second thing is M&A. If Exxon buys Mobil, we lose one enterprise there. And so while \u2013 and there may be an impact on us in terms of our contract value, but we definitely lose an enterprise (45:16). So if you look at M&A and out of business, the M&A across all size companies, and there's a lot of it in the economy, and then out of business, there's a lot of small enterprises that go out of business, that's kind of the biggest part of our \u2013 of the clients we lose. And those are things that are kind of just a structural part of the market.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And, Manav...","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","...that's why the wallet retention measure is so important because again it's putting a dollar value on those clients as opposed to the client retention where Gene's Pizza Parlor is created equal to the ExxonMobil's of this world. And so it points to us retaining higher spending clients at a better rate, and it also points to those clients that stay with us spending more and more each and every year. So again, that's why we give both measures, they're both important measures. And we're not satisfied at 83% or 84%. We do think there's a little bit of room for improvement there, but there's the structural things Gene mentioned, which are there and we'll have to deal with for forever.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And the new products that you talked about, Gene, I guess, maybe a little quicker than we expected, but that's good to hear, but is that new product, which you said, I guess, the best of IT and CEB, that's going to be targeted just to the CEB clients, maybe just a more color there? Like how may products and so forth we should be expecting?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, you can think about the new products in having two big differences from CEB's products today. One is it will be seat-based rather than an enterprise license. So it's for the use of a specific individual. The second thing is it will have more research content. And so that provides more value. And then the third thing is that it will be combined, not just more content, but also, as I mentioned, the type of content that CEB had and the type of content that Gartner had, which are highly complementary. Clients love both of those.","And so we're going to have these new products that will provide a lot more value because you've got both \u2013 it's seat-based, so it's for that individual user, and it's got this incredible additional content. As I mentioned before, we're going to have a new product for each of the areas of CEB's business. So think about they were in areas like finance, sales, HR, et cetera. We will introduce new products in each of those areas in a \u2013 not all at once. We're going to do \u2013 as I mentioned, the first one will be introducing in the summer timeframe \u2013 this summer timeframe. And then we expect to follow others \u2013 we have others, meaning like one of those roles will go first, then another role, and then another role, then another role over time. And we're planning to get all of the new products introduced, so you're going to think about over a 12-month period. And \u2013 that's what we'll be selling.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And just one last clarification question for Craig. The 2017 guidance and the double-digit accretion that you expect in 2018, does that include or not -- exclude the $50 million of cost synergies that you talked about prior?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","So Manav, consistent with what we talked about when we did the announcement, the 2018 is exclusive of cost synergies. And again, the target that we've talked about, ranging up to $50 million, we're working very diligently to be in a place where we can harvest as much of that in 2018. That said, given when contracts run through or the timing of when we can reduce or eliminate certain costs may roll into 2018. So think of that more on a run rate basis or an annualized basis as opposed to all coming through in 2018. That said, we're going to do our best to harvest as much of that as possible in 2018.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff P. Meuler at Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Gene, any more thoughts that you're willing to share at this point in terms of how you're planning to structure and combine the sales forces and facilitate cross-sales across the non-overlapping client base?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So we're going to structure the sales force in a very similar way to what we had \u2013 the way Gartner had been structured. As you know, we sold to different client segments. We had \u2013 our biggest segment was being like CIOs and IT departments. We also, though, sold to chief supply chain officers and their teams as well as chief marketing officers and their teams. For each of those areas, we had a dedicated sales force really. So if you think about a sales force (50:35) and her team, a different sales force. Part of our overall global sales force with a different set of \u2013 a different dedicated team selling to marketing leaders, and different teams selling to supply chain leaders.","CEB actually followed a very similar approach and we're going to continue that. So if you think about the structure as being, there will be \u2013 within our global sales force, there will be teams focused on each of the functional areas of the business: IT, marketing, supply chain, HR, finance, sales, product development, et cetera.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And the facilitation of non-overlapping client's process?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So we've had this opportunity for us before. And basically, we have a sales force set up so that if there's two Gartner salespeople in the account, one's selling to the CIO and one selling to the chief supply chain officer, which again we have today, we encourage and train our salespeople to help each other out because I help you today and then someone else helps me tomorrow, they all kind of get that and want to collaborate in the accounts. And then that's for all accounts. And then for larger accounts, we have a more senior salesperson that would coordinate sales across the account. And that's what we've already been doing. We've been doing that historically.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And Jeff, just to add to that, the way we think about it is, the best way for us to drive growth and penetrate accounts is for the people who specialize in selling IT, supply chain, HR, whatever it might be, to actually go do that and talk to the HR professional, supply chain professionals, marketing professionals direct. And so there is coordination, as Gene talked about. But again, the way we drive productivity and the way we drive growth is by actually having those salespeople specialize in those functions going after those functions.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Just add one more piece to that. The way to think about it is not so much that the IT person refers you to the supply chain person. But it's more \u2013 if you understand what the most important mission-critical priorities are that the IT person is working on, if it's a corporate mission-critical priority, which that's what we want to be helping on, it's not just the IT department that's working on that. The people in finance are, the people in HR are, the people in sales are, the people in HR are. And so we have a very good process for making sure that whatever salespeople are calling an individual enterprise, they understand \u2013 when we learn about what the enterprise's mission-critical priorities are, each of the salespeople understands that. And then to Craig's point then, they can apply that in their functional discipline, whether it be marketing, HR, finance, et cetera.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Patrick Halfmann at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.","Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Craig, you mentioned strengthening bookings trends throughout the quarter in your prepared remarks. I'm wondering if that strength carried over into the first few weeks of the second quarter and whether relatedly you would expect to see an acceleration in organic constant currency CEB growth in the second quarter.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Patrick. Yeah. So we did see an acceleration from Jan to Feb and from Feb to March, and part of that we attribute to some of the announcement noise as clients look to see if there was something to be gained from waiting. And when they found out that there wasn't, they went ahead and bought. We obviously can't comment on Q2. We're obviously a couple of days into May. We're in the process of closing our books for April. But again, what we feel good about is we've had really strong performance, Q3, Q4 into Q1, and we expect that to continue.","Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Appert at Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. So Gene, the growth in the sales force, you dialed it back a little bit in the last year or so from the pace of the prior several years. This is for the, obviously, core Gartner business. Can you just talk about your thought process around that? And might that have positive implications from a margin perspective because it is translating into a little bit of improvement, it seems, in sales productivity?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. So Peter, our \u2013 we remained committed to having double-digit growth in our sales force. There \u2013 from time-to-time, there's things that affect how fast it shows. As Craig said, this particular quarter, two things happened. One is we had particularly large growth in Q1 of last year. Secondly, there was a bit of a timing. We train our salespeople in classes. And it happens that the people that graduate in 2016, they graduated earlier than those people graduating in 2017, flows into Q2 as opposed to Q1. And so that made it look a little lower than it is. But we're still committed to the kind of double-digit sales force growth we've had historically.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yes, but it's still below the 15%-ish number you've been doing and so that it feels like it's at its slower pace.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, Peter, as I said before, as you probably say before, the way that we developed \u2013 so we target growth in that kind of time \u2013 in that kind of range. What we actually deliver is based on looking \u2013 as you know, we develop our sales territories bottoms up based on what each individual manager \u2013 sales manager has the ability to manage. So if we had \u2013 and at any given point in time, we have some sales leaders that can add a lot more people and we have other sales leaders, perhaps they're new to the world and they need a little more time to get their feet on the ground, can't grow quite as quickly. And so the number we end up with, if you equalize for timing, like we had this quarter, then we wind up with whether it's 13%, 17%, whatever, is basically given by the bottoms-up readiness for individual managers to take additional growth. So that's why we don't forecast specific number. We look at what the ability of the individual managers are but we're confident it's going to be in that kind of double-digit range.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And Peter, and we also \u2013 as we've talked about, we go faster in places where we have the management capability to handle and very strong productivity and we obviously slowed down in areas that may be impacted by macro things and have lower productivity. And so for example, about 1.5 year ago, we talked about challenges in Brazil, challenges in oil and gas, we were not growing sales force in those areas when we were having those challenges.","Now that we've come out of those and oil and gas or the energy utility sector, rather, is back growing at double-digit rates, we're now growing in that sector again. So it is a bottoms-up approach, as Gene talked about, and we also tap the brakes or press on the gas pedal depending on the market situations that we're selling into as well. And what we said for this year was we had \u2013 on that bottoms-up view, we expected around 13% head count growth. If we do see productivity improving or if we see we can go faster in places that may go off. If we challenges, we may pump the brakes on it.","Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington at Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. So a question for you on Consulting. You mentioned the backlog being down against a tough comp and I wanted to ask when you expect the year-over-year growth to turn positive again there and also, if you could talk about some of the opportunities for synergies there with CEB?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","The \u2013 so I'll start with the Consulting \u2013 the synergies of CEB. So the way our Consulting business works today is, it is focused in the IT part of our business, not in marketing, not in supply chain. And as you know, it helps large clients that want more time, more help from Gartner the they can't get from our typical half hour analyst call. We've got instituted Consulting in marketing or supply chain, and we don't at this point have a plan to do that and either CEB function as well. So primarily, there would be some synergy, would be things like lead referrals and things like that as opposed to seeing an extension of functions like HR, et cetera, like we do in IT traditionally.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Bill, it's Craig. On the backlog question, your observation is right around the grover (59:38) problem. The way to think about the backlog on a go-forward basis, again, we target having about four months of forward-looking backlog, and we generally feel pretty positive when we have that amount of backlog ready to go. Also remember that we are booking and burning within a quarter. So we may book something in January and actually start working it off in February and March. It doesn't show up in the backlog number at the end of the quarter or reduced amount, so it shows up in the backlog number at the end of the quarter or reduced amount shows up in the backlog number at the end of the quarter but we're actually working and generating revenue and profitability in the quarter. So there's a combination of wanting to have that four-month forward target, which we have and also there is a fair amount of book and burn within a quarter as well.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","One last thing that which is, we don't really want six months of backlog because when a backlog gets too big for our kind of business, clients then \u2013 we're not working on their project and they're unhappy because we have to delay the start of the project. And so you don't want to have two months of backlog, but we also don't have six months. So four months \u2013 and again, for our type of Consulting business, allows us to meet a start time and a work pace that our clients are happy with. Sometimes, it gets a little higher because you want to have a little bit larger contracts, whatever, sometimes lower, but that four months is what we're really targeting.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jeff Silber at BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead please.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. Wanted to focus on the operating cash flow guidance. I know you mentioned a number of issues in terms of CEB's first quarter doesn't count in the guidance and the fact that you're adding interest expense. But on a standalone Gartner basis, did you update or is there any impact to operating cash flow guidance?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Jeff, it's Craig. So in essence, if you actually could do a standalone Gartner cash flow, we would have been in the same range where we were. It's really difficult to do that, given the interest expense, the timing of it, acquisition and integration payment, et cetera, et cetera. On a standalone basis, the way we thought about it is, as I mentioned, the prime driver of what we saw in Q1 was really the timing of our contract value growth with more of it coming in March then in January and February. And again, so collections that we had anticipated would have come in, in the first quarter are actually now coming in, in Q2.","So we'll get the benefit of that in Q2. And then if we have timing as we've anticipated, with April, May and June, we'll get back on track. So that's the way we thought about the standalone guidance to the effect that we actually could do and model standalone Gartner cash flow guidance.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I understand. Thank you for that. And I know again, it's only been about a month since the acquisition, but are there any anecdotes you can share from clients in terms of how receptive they are post-acquisition?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, yeah, we've gotten a lot of input from clients, both that we've spoken to directly or have sent messages through our sales force, I mean written communications. And the \u2013 it has been much \u2013 even more positive than I would've expected. So we had a view that this would be very positive long-term, but clients that have been buying CEB, we expected they might have a little trepidation. Is Gartner going to not deliver the same value? There's some reason they bought CEB products. And actually it's been quite the opposite. The client reaction has been \u2013 the typical client reaction has been, they totally get why this, they think it's a great thing to do and looking forward to products. So it's been \u2013 we expected good reception over time. It has been much more positive even than we had expected.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thanks so much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi at Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking our question. This is Mike Reid for Joe. Could you \u2013 did you talk about \u2013 we're a little late to the call -- about sort of the deleveraging process post the acquisition? And will that start immediately and kind of what that would look like?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Mike. The way we are thinking about it and modeling it and is consistent with what we talked about when we announced the acquisition is that we are targeting to get down to around three times gross leverage over the next 24 months to 36 months. We feel, given the free cash flow generation capabilities of the combined entity, that we'll be able to do that. We will be looking to do some modest deleveraging over the next few quarters, primarily next three quarters to four quarters, most notably taking out the bridge financing that's sitting on the balance sheet right now. That will be modest, but I would expect the real de-levering to start moving in earnest over the course of 2018 and through 2019. And again, within 24 months to 36 months, we're targeting to get down to three times gross leverage.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thanks for the detail on the timeline.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Gene Hall for closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Great. Thank you. So as you heard today, we had a great, a very strong Q1, which we're very excited about the core Gartner business. In addition, we closed on CEB. We've now owned the business for about a month. That is going as planned and we're thrilled with the opportunities before us there.

We have posted the press release and the earnings supplement on our website investor.gartner.com.","Following comments by Gene and Craig, we will open up the call for your questions.

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.","Now I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.","Gene Hall","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. For the second quarter of 2019, we continue to deliver strong performances across our business. Total revenues were up 12%, fueled by double-digit growth in each of our business segments -- Research, Conferences and Consulting. We continue to make significant global impact through these segments. We help more than 15,000 enterprise clients in more than 100 countries around the world with their mission-critical priorities, while providing great jobs to more than 16,000 associates globally.","Research, our largest and most profitable segment, is the core of our value proposition. Our Research business was up 10% over this time last year. The Gartner formula for sustained double-digit growth drives our success in our Research business. As we've previously highlighted, the Gartner formula consists of indispensable insights, exceptional talent, sales excellence and enabling infrastructure.","For each of these elements, we drive relentless, globally consistent execution of best practices and continues improvement in innovation. Global Technology Sales or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. This group represents more than 80% of our total research contract value. GTS contract value growth was 14% year-over-year. We delivered double-digit growth in every region across every sized company and in virtually every industry.","Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT and represents about 20% of our total research contract value. This includes supply chain and marketing, which we've addressed for several years, as well as other major enterprise roles including HR, finance, legal, sales and more. GBS continued on a path towards double-digit growth with total GBS contract value accelerating to 1%.","Our GxL product line continued to gain momentum with contract value increasing $20 million sequentially. GxL products provide greater value to clients because they are tailored to the client's individual needs. This in turn results in higher prices per user and stronger retention. Beyond better pricing retention, GxL products provide exponentially more growth opportunities, because we can sell these high-value products throughout our clients' organizations.","For Q2, GxL contract value grew 71% year-over-year and new business was up 51%. We continue to expect double-digit contract value growth in GBS by the end of the year. Our Conferences segment also delivered a terrific performance in Q2, with double-digit revenue growth up 29%. Gartner Conferences combined the outstanding value for research with the immersive experience of live interactions, making every conference we produce, the most important gathering for the executives we serve.","We continue to invest in our Conferences portfolio. In GTS, we expanded our flagship conference, Gartner IT Symposium. We held an IT symposium conference in Canada, which exceeded performance expectations. In GBS, we continue to build out our conference portfolio to align to the GBS rules we serve. In June, we launched the Gartner CFO in Finance Executive conference. This program featured strategic guidance on the trends that shape finance, company performance and personal leadership. We gave participants the opportunity to connect with peers and talk one-on-one with thought leaders. This conference had a great attendance with 63% of attendees at the CFO or VP level. Over time, we'll launch additional conferences to put the other functions in GBS.","In addition to all that, we'll continue growing the Evanta business. Our Consulting segment also achieved double-digit growth in Q2 with revenues up 10%. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. It provides clients a deeper level of involvement through extended project-based work to help them execute their most strategic initiatives. Our growth in the quarter was a combination of our labor-based business and strength in our Contract Optimization business.","As you will hear from Craig, we've adjusted our guidance for the rest of the year. These changes are driven by two factors: A modest reduction in expected revenues and a modest increase in expected costs. The revenue change was driven by two factors as well. First, lower non-subscription Research revenue than expected. Within our Research segment, we have some non-subscription-based products, many of which are legacy. One of our strategic priorities is emphasizing subscription-based research offerings compared to non-subscription-based offerings. In Q2, our non-subscription-based revenues were lower than expected, and we expect this to affect the revenues during the rest of the year as well.","The second factor is lower than forecast subscription revenue. While very strong, our contract value growth is modestly below our plan set out at the start of the year. There are number of drivers that are individually minor, but in aggregate have an impact. These items included a larger than usual number of sales leadership changes in GTS, expanded deployment of sales teams into our Dallas and Barcelona offices and changes to our selling approach for various small tech companies.","The second major factor driving our adjusted guidance is a modest increase in costs as we were more successful than expected in filling open sales territories. Sales territories become open through a combination of planned growth, promotions, lateral moves within Gartner, sales people leaving the business. Once the salesperson gives notice that they're leaving, it takes about three months to hire a replacement and another six weeks to train them before they get into territory. It can take longer in some countries or when specialized skills are needed.","Now we sell less in a sales territory with no salesperson than one that has a salesperson. So one of our priorities is to minimize the time sales territories are open. We made significant progress last year. We exceeded our expectations again this year and expect this trend to continue. For example, in one of our sales organizations, we planned for 6% open territories and are achieving 2%. Over time, this additional sales people come up to speed, which will lead to higher sales.","In the near term, we incur higher-than-planned costs. These include compensation, recruiting, training and technology. As a result, we're expecting our SG&A through the rest of the year to be higher than originally planned with the payout in incremental sales being realized in 2020. So we've adjusted our guidance to reflect a modest reduction in revenues combined with a modest increase in costs.","Looking ahead, we are well positioned for sustained double-digit growth. We expect continued sustained double-digit growth in GTS. We're at an inflection point in GBS. We've invested to get GBS on a growth trajectory to realize the incredible market potential. In Q2, contract value growth accelerated, and we expect to continue acceleration.","Going forward, we expect to get a strong return on the investments we've made in GBS, with GBS contributing to both higher research contract value growth and increasing profits. And of course, Conferences and Consulting are on a strong path. Looking ahead to 2020 with the great strategic positioning of GTS and GBS together with leveraging the investments we've made, we expect double-digit top line growth and EBITDA growing approximately in line with revenues.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig.","Craig Safian","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Global Technology Sales, the largest part of our business continues to deliver exceptional growth. Global Business Sales contract value growth turned positive. Our strategy to deliver products and services with a compelling value proposition across all enterprise functions is working. Conferences and Consulting are having outstanding years. This year, we are completing a period of above-trend investments across our business positioning us for sustained long-term double-digit growth.","Second quarter revenue was $1 billion, up 9% on a reported basis and 12% on an FX-neutral basis. The product retirements we discussed last quarter impacted the top line growth rate by about 130 basis points. In addition, contribution margin was 64%, up 39 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA was $185 million, up 1% year-over-year and 4% FX neutral, slightly above our expectations.","Adjusted EPS was $1.45 with meaningful help from tax, and free cash flow in the quarter was $197 million. Our Research business had a strong quarter. Research revenue grew 8% in the second quarter and 10% on an FX-neutral basis. Second quarter contribution margin was 69%. Total contract value was $3.2 billion at June 30. FX neutral growth of 11% versus the prior year.","I'll now review the details of our performance for both GTS and GBS. In the second quarter, GTS contract value increased 14% versus the prior year. GTS had contract value of $2.6 billion on June 30, representing just over 80% of our total contract value.","Client retention for GTS remained strong at 82%. Wallet retention for GTS was 105% for the quarter, up 25 basis points year-over-year. The combination of the client and wallet retention rates show how our clients spend more with us each and every year reinforcing the value we provide to clients.","GTS new business increased 4% versus the second quarter of last year, which had a very strong new business -- which had very strong new business growth. New business is coming from a mix of new enterprises and growth in existing enterprises through sales of additional services and upgrades. The third quarter pipeline is strong.","We ended the second quarter with 12,739 GTS enterprises, up 3% compared to Q2 2018. The average contract value for enterprise also continues to grow. It now stands at $203,000 for enterprise in GTS, up 10% year-over-year. As we discussed previously, we continue to invest in GTS. The investments in headcount growth and improving productivity are driving the GTS acceleration you have seen over the course of 2018 and into the first half of 2019.","At the end of the second quarter, we had 3,207 quota-bearing associates in GTS or growth of 14%, reflecting our planned growth and the better-than-expected reduction in our open territories. For GTS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, provided by the beginning period quota-bearing headcount was $110,000 per salesperson, up 2% versus second quarter of last year. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year productivity improvement.","Turning to Global Business Sales. GBS contract value was $602 million at the end of the second quarter or about 20% of total contract value. CV returned to growth, increasing 1% year-over-year. Many of our GBS metrics continue to be affected by the discontinuation in 2018 of sales of the largest legacy products. As we described the last couple of quarters, the discontinuations were based on a purposeful strategy that allows our sales team to focus on GxL products going forward. GxL products continue to gain share and are an important part of our strategy.","Looking at total contract value from the GxL products, we drove an FX-neutral increase of 71% year-over-year from $133 million to $228 million. Similar to the last 2 quarters, on Page 11 of the earnings supplement, we provided a bridge from the first quarter to second quarter. We sold $29 million of GXL new business in Q2, up 51% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to make great progress with our GXL products across each of the functions GBS serves.","More than half of the GXL new business in the quarter came from newly launched products. GXL CV now makes up 38% of our total GBS contract value, up 16 percentage points from Q2 of last year. While legacy GBS CV attrition is close to 30%, GXL attrition is around 20%, almost at GTS levels.","We reduced attrition levels through improving client engagement. We are driving increased client engagement through expanded service teams and growing adoption of individualized content and service. For the stand-alone quarter, we drove attrition rates down for GBS.","For contracts that were up for renewal in the second quarter, attrition improved by about 270 basis points over the prior year quarter. Again, this is a result of the increased engagement, we discussed in all of our other retention programs having an impact.","We continue to expect to achieve double-digit CV growth in GBS by the end of this year. The combination of improving attrition and corresponding retention rates and continued ramping of GXL new business are the metrics that will get us there.","At the end of the second quarter, we had 919 quota-bearing associates in GBS or growth of 24%. We expect GBS headcount growth to moderate by the end of the year to approximately 16% to 18%. We have made significant investments in GBS in sales as well as in research, products and services. With the investments we have made and those contemplated in our guidance, we are well positioned to see the benefits as we move into 2020.","In Conferences, revenues increased by 27% year-over-year in Q2 to $141 million. FX-neutral growth was 29%. Second quarter contribution margin was 57%, up slightly from the same quarter last year. We had very strong growth from GBS Conferences including marketing and supply chain.","As Gene mentioned, we also had a very successful launch of our first Conference for finance leaders. And the Evanta continues to grow over 20%, a significant improvement from before we owned it.","We had 27 destination Conferences in the second quarter. On the same Conference FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 21% with an 18% increase in attendees. The second quarter is typically our second largest quarter after the fourth quarter and Q2 was strong for our Conferences business.","Second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 7% to $104 million. FX-neutral growth was 10%. Consulting contribution margin was 33% in the second quarter. Labor-based revenues were $79 million, up 3% versus Q2 of last year or 5% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 773 was up 9%. Utilization was 63%. Backlog at June 30 was $110 million, up 7% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. Our pipeline for the second half of the year remained strong.","Contract optimization revenues were up 27% versus the prior year quarter. As we have detailed in the past, this part of our -- this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable.","SG&A increased 13% year-over-year in the second quarter or 16% on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to grow sales capacity and the enabling infrastructure to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long term. The enabling infrastructure includes investments in human resources functions like recruiting and in real estate to support our increased number of associates around the world.","As we discussed at Investor Day, our largest dollar investments are in GTS where we have seen strong growth in contract value and higher productivity. Our continuing investments in GCS, the Conferences' sales team, have been driving faster growth in that segment.","GBS investments are also continuing, and we expect to see contract value acceleration this year and going forward, which will drive return on the investments we have been making. Across all of our sales teams, we are investing to increase territories to reduce open roles and to drive improvements in sales productivity.","Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $185 million, up 1% on a reported basis and 4% on an FX-neutral basis. EBITDA was adversely affected by about 5 percentage points or $7 million impact due to the product retirements.","Taking that into consideration, the underlying FX-neutral EBITDA growth was about 9% in the quarter. Depreciation was up about $3 million from last year as additional office space went into service. Amortization was flat sequentially after taking an expected step down in the fourth quarter last year as some of the acquisition intangibles reached their 18-month life.","Integration expenses were down year-over-year as we have moved past the biggest part of the integration work. Interest expense excluding deferred financing cost in the quarter was $23 million, down from $28 million in the second quarter of 2018.","The lower interest expense resulted from paying down roughly $250 million in debt over the past year. The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was negative 3% for the quarter.","The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was affected positively by an intercompany sale of intellectual property, which resulted in the material favourable impact on the adjusted tax rate. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 23.1% in the quarter.","Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $1.45 with upside relative to our expectations from below the line items including a lower-than-expected tax rate. In Q2, operating cash flow was $227 million compared to $174 million last year.","The increase in operating cash flow was driven by lower interest expense, lower taxes and contributions from working capital. Q2, 2019 CapEx was $39 million and Q2 cash acquisition and integration payments and other nonrecurring items was approximately $8 million.","This yields Q2 free cash flow of $197 million, which is up 25% versus the prior year quarter, normalizing 2018 for divestitures and working capital timing. On a rolling 4-quarter basis, our free cash flow conversion was 126% of adjusted net income excluding divested operations and working capital timing.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our June 30, debt balance was about $2.2 billion. Our debt is 100% fixed rate. Adjusting EBITDA for the divestitures, our gross leverage ratio is now about 3.2x EBITDA. We repurchased about $2 million of stock in the quarter.","We will continue to be price-sensitive and opportunistic as we return capital to shareholders. We have about $870 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We deploy our free cash flow and balance sheet flexibility by returning capital to our shareholders through our buyback programs and through strategic value-enhancing M&A.","Turning to the outlook for 2019. We've recalibrated our revenue outlook, modestly lowering the growth expectations in Research including the non-subscription fees while increasing the expectations for Conferences and Consulting. The top line growth outlook on an FX neutral basis remained strong.","In addition, as we move through the first half of the year, we decided to make modest investments, most notably reducing the level of open territories in GBS. Our GTS and Conferences investments have been generating returns, and we expect to see returns from the GBS investments as we move into 2020.","As a result of these changes, we revised our outlook relative to our initial guidance. As you think about modeling the operations for the rest of the year, we expect mostly typical seasonality for the quarter we're facing. In addition, our guidance reflects FX rates as of June 30. Due to U.S. dollar strengthening, we expect FX to cost roughly two-point negative impact for projected 2019 full year growth rates across revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flows.","Looking at our updated full year guidance, we expect revenue towards the lower end of the $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion range. That is FX neutral growth of 10% to 11%. This reflects research revenues of about $3.355 billion to $3.380 billion or adoption at the midpoint of about 2%. About half of the reduction is from non-subscription products and services.","As a reminder, in addition to the non-core businesses that we've divested over the course of 2018, there were some additional products from the CEB acquisition that we viewed as non-core. We retired these, which is impacting our 2019 total revenue growth rate by about 75 basis points. This is almost $30 million, about two-thirds of which drops to EBITDA.","Additionally, as Gene mentioned, our Q2 non-subscription-based revenues were lower than expected, and we expect this trend to continue for the rest of the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $700 million. FX neutral growth of down 1% to up 4%. Some of the lower EBITDA reflects modestly lower revenue expectations.","In addition, this reflects incremental operating expense of 1% to 2% versus our prior outlook. As Gene mentioned, we decided to invest on the original plan to take advantage of the opportunities we see for increased growth, most notably the reduction in open territories.","We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 25.5% for the full year 2019. Please note that if you're adding back from GAAP net income, the rate for the tax effect on the add backs is also about 25.5%.","Our full year tax rate remains unchanged despite the benefit in the second quarter. Our tax planning related to our intellectual property is ongoing, and we anticipate incremental tax cost in the fourth quarter. We expect 2019 adjusted EPS of between $3.39 and $3.64 per share, a range of down 7% to flat year-over-year.","For 2019, we expect free cash flow of $400 million to $430 million as the projected FX neutral change of down 2% to up 5% versus our normalized 2018 free cash flow. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.","For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS of about $0.40 to $0.45 per share. As you build your models, remember that last year's third quarter EBITDA was very strong. This year, we have a larger cost base, and the third quarter is a small revenue quarter, which magnifies the effect of the costs. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 30s on a percentage basis.","Through the first half of the year, we have delivered strong results across our business. Notably, GTS contract value growth continues to be strong and sales of our new GxL products in GBS continue to rise. Our Conferences and Consulting businesses both had outstanding quarters. Free cash flow was up versus last year and conversion was stable. We are applying the Gartner formula across the combined business to drive sustained long-term double-digit growth to revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. I guess, do you want to start out obviously, I guess, on the revenue outlook for the Research business? The first, the non-subscription piece. In the Q, you released kind of the point-in-time revenue as one of the disclosures, and that number would be pretty -- or looks kind of consistent sequentially. It was up 17% year-over-year. So can you help us give a little more color on the non-subscription piece being lower than you thought because that would seem like a pretty steady and kind of healthy growth number?","Craig Safian","Hey, good morning Tim. Thanks for the question. So on the Research revenue, as you point out, a hunk of the reduction relates to non-subscription revenue. There's a couple of factors going on there. They're buried within the disclosure and the year-over-year growth rate you're seeing.","So as you know, we retired a bunch of products at the end of 2018, and we're dealing with the impact of that in 2019. That was contemplated in the original guidance. On top of that, there were a number of non-subscription products tied to GBS that were not retired, but did not get the sales focus in the first half of the year as we've been driving real focus on GxL and subscription products.","And so the revenue on those fell off faster than we had anticipated, and we're baking that continued fall-off into the balance of the year, and that is obviously impacting the growth rate and the guidance a little bit, but more pronounced the outlook for the rest of the year.","On top of that, there are some additional non-subscriptions revenues, which, as you point out, continue to perform very strongly, but have come down modestly from more elevated levels of performance in previous quarters.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And then just on the subscription piece of the guidance change, I guess the Research revenue guide changed by roughly 2%, and we only have half a year left. GTS' growth, I guess I'm trying to reconcile the fact that against a tougher comp slowdown 80 bps and why for half year that drives a two-point change in the full year outlook -- or sorry, even if it's one point, I guess, related to the subscription piece, that would seem to be a bigger impact than I would've thought unless the original guidance assumed, I guess, further acceleration in GTS.","Craig Safian","Yeah. Hey, Tim, it's a good point, and you're right. Again, about half of the reduction relates to subscription, half to non-subscription. So, about 1% is a more accurate way to think about it. I think a couple of things. So one is that with GTS it's still performing really, really well, 13.5% growth is very strong. And again, it's up from where we were in 2017, and early parts of 2018. It had been humming along at north of 14%, and obviously, that modest slowdown we saw in the second quarter has a flow-through impact, and it's not just the quarterly impact and flowing that through we've also modulated the expectations for Q3 and Q4, and that had a modest impact on the outlook as well. And so it's really the \u2013 essentially, and Gene described it, which was our outlook was for stronger total combined CV growth through the first half of the year. We're off that modestly and that's causing that roughly 1% impact on the subscription revenue for 2019.","Tim McHugh","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Meuler","Yeah. I guess on the subscription piece, just a follow-up. You mentioned some sales leadership \u2013 or elevated sales leadership at GTS or maybe some execution hiccups. Can you just go into more detail on that? And to what extent do you view macro as a factor that could be impacting kind of both the small business non-subs revenue as well as the GTS contract value deceleration?","Gene Hall","Hey, Jeff, it's Gene. So basically, as I mentioned, so \u2013 and as Craig mentioned, GTS is a great contributor. 13.5% is very strong growth. It was a little off what we had expected. As I said, there were a number of small factors that individually wouldn't be a big deal, but happened to all here at once and I'll just go through it. So first, we had some management \u2013 some leadership changes in GTS. We always have both. We happen to have a greater than usual number.","So, for example, we had a leader running Asia for many years, who needed to come back to U.S. for personal reasons. We had \u2013 in Germany, we had our two top people that were running Germany got \u2013 one got promoted, one go to GBS. We had changes in the \u2013 for similar things. So I've just got a \u2013 there's a bunch of, in order for this more spread out, it happened for a combination of business and personal reasons to be more concentrated in the first half. So that was one piece of it.","Second piece, I mentioned was an expansion of our Dallas and Barcelona offices. We \u2013 as we \u2013 as a company, we grow. We need to have different talent pools. We \u2013 our European headquarters has traditionally been in the London area. Through a combination of Brexit and other talent markets, we've opened a major office in Barcelona, and again, moved a bunch of people, leaders and \u2013 into Barcelona, which was disruptive. The similar thing happened between Florida and Texas. This year, we expanded our Dallas office. Again, these were planned quite a bit of an advance and just happened here at the same time.","And then I also mentioned, we changed our approach to selling to various small tech companies. There is a lot of innovations. Small tech companies are great market for us, and we organized slightly to make it more effective in selling to that market. Each of those things normally wouldn't have \u2013 the rolls falls back, but then you like \u2013 there are others, but these are kind of the biggest ones. Each of them were small, but collectively results in that very minor change in our growth rate and subscription revenue. And it's all GTS basically.","Jeff Meuler","And then your view on macro is not a worsening factor?","Gene Hall","We don't see it. So if you look at our business, so our Research \u2013 GTS grew 13.5%, GBS accelerated and then -- I mean, I'm sorry, Conferences business had a very strong quarter, one of the strongest quarters we've ever had. Our Consulting business had a very strong quarter. So across the business, we had really a lot of strength. Now again, at any point in time, we have some companies that are doing really well. We have some of our clients that \u2013 among the 15,000 enterprise clients, some that are not doing so well. It's just our Consulting business. There's clearly an uptick and interest in cost optimization. But again, all of our businesses had very strong performance.","Jeff Meuler","Okay. And then just, I guess, similar question given that it's only a half-year effect on the magnitude of the EBITDA guidance reduction and EPS guidance reduction. Is it \u2013 should we think about some of this lost revenue being at like a near 100% decremental margin or just a very high decremental margin? And then on top of that, I guess the other factor is GBS sales headcount is going to trend higher because of the closing of the open territories. Is that the right way to think about it, or just \u2013 I'm trying to understand the magnitude of it.","Craig Safian","Yeah. Jeff, I think, good morning, it's Craig, I think that's the right way to think about it. So for a portion of the revenue reduction, it would have flowed through at very high margins. So basically, cost-based fixed and when the revenue's there, it flows through very high margins. Conversely, when the revenue's not there, the hurt is large flow-through margins as well.","On some of the revenue, we were able to, or are able to modulate the costs, but for the most part, they are \u2013 it is a fixed cost base. And so your assertion on the large decremental revenue is appropriate. In terms of the cost, I think you're right also. Most notably, it is the reduction in open territories in GBS, but also a little bit in GTS and in our conference sales, but most notably in GBS that is flowing through to the balance of the year. I think the other thing worth noting is some of this \u2013 some of the increased spending was baked into our Q2 outlook.","At that point, when we gave our guidance, we \u2013 our view was we would make it up in other areas and then obviously, as Gene mentioned, with a modest downtick in our revenue expectation and this modest uptick in the cost. It caused us to recalibrate the outlook coming out of the second quarter.","Jeff Meuler","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. If I could just follow-up on that \u2013 on the EBITDA guidance, I guess you reduced that by about $60 million to $65 million. I think you said that the non-subscription or kind of legacy GBS stuff that you had was $30 million of complete drop through. So is that the right way to think about it, $30 million of that is that drop through you talked about? And is the rest of that split between the increased, I guess, investment in sales on the two \u2013 GBS and GTS side?","Craig Safian","Yeah, good morning, Manav, it's Craig. So I think the way to think about it is \u2013 you're roughly right. And so yeah, as I mentioned just before with Jeff, there's some portion of the revenue downside where it's not 100% flow through. We're actually able to eliminate or reduce certain cost, but most of it is flowing through. And then the increased spending, again, most notably around faster growth or lower proportion of open territories in GBS. So, I think that is the right way to think about it.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, got it. And then also just to the earlier question on the macro impact. I think in your 10-Q, you usually have this language on double-digit growth in contract value across your industry segments. And I think last quarter, it was three quarters and in this quarter, you said it was half. So, is that just law of large numbers? I guess it's just trying to use that data point to follow-up and if you are seeing any slowdown, deceleration in your segments.","Craig Safian","Yes. I think the way to think about it is, in GTS, where we've traditionally made that comment, it's every client size, every major region and virtually every industry grew at double-digit rates. The comment in the Q, I believe relates to the combined GTS and GBS. And so that's going to be a little more mixed just because we are combining a 13.5% grower with a 1% grower.","But on the GTS side, the way we look at the measures, it's been very consistent where we've had that same level of almost universal double-digit growth across every vector that you could look at.","Manav Patnaik","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. So, I wanted to clarify, are you still expecting to get the double-digit CV growth in GBS by the end of the year? And also just in general, I know you made the change in GTS to selling to the small tech companies in terms of sales processes, but are there any sales processes that you're changing in GBS or are you just, just given that GXL has been such a big transition, are you just sort of seeing it takes time and just seeing how that goes, or are you sort of incrementally changing that as it goes along as well?","Gene Hall","Hey Toni, it's Gene. So, we are expecting double-digit growth in the GBS by the end of this year, which will reflect that. We obviously know what our results were for the first half. We have our bottoms-up forecast for Q3 and we've looked at what we think new business and retention's likely will be in Q4. And that's what we're basing our expectation that we will still get to double-digit growth by the end of 2019. So, it's based on, like I said, the results for the first half, our positive forecast for Q3 and then our expectations on what would happen in Q4. So that's the impact question.","In terms of sales process, the way that we've been handling GBS is, let's make sure we get the right product line, which has got GXL in, let's make sure we get the right capacity, which we've got the sales capacity, let's make sure we've got the right selling -- direct selling recruiting, training, tools, and processes in place and the right retention programs.","All those things now are in place and we've modeled them as we talked in the past of what we've done very successfully for many years for GTS. And so while we're -- while we may make some tweaks as we learn in terms of the processes, we really feel like we've got all of the pieces in place and that's why you're seeing the kind of really strong acceleration.","And as Craig talked about, we had $29 million of new business in Q2. That was up 51% in Q1 for GxL. These products are really selling very, very well. And so we feel kind of that we're on a really good track there.","Toni Kaplan","Great. And then I know I ask this question all the time, but given that EBITDA margins for this year at the midpoint of guidance are about 160 basis points lower than last year, which was 100 basis points lower than the year before, I know there is sort of a major transition going on and the revenue growth hasn't come in as quickly as the expense level right now, but what sort of long-term, the right level for margins for the business? I'm not trying to say like where are you going to be this year or next year, et cetera, but just over time, like what kind of margin level should this business support? Thank you.","Craig Safian","Hey, good morning, Toni, it's Craig. So, I think we're not going to give long-term guidance on our margin expectation. I think Gene, in his remarks, outlined the way that we're all thinking about 2020 right now, which is we'll grow revenue at double-digit rates, continue our trend of strength in revenue, and we'd expect EBITDA to grow approximately roughly in line with revenue next year.","We've obviously made a lot of investments in the business, again across GTS, GBS and Conferences. And as we talked about, we really feel good about the returns we're getting in GTS and on the Conferences side, and we fully expect to start realizing those returns in GBS in 2020.","Toni Kaplan","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys. Good morning. So, if I look at the incremental -- the slight reduction in revenue and the incremental cost that the EBITDA guidance implies, even if we assume a much higher than corporate average margin on that revenue, and I guess acknowledging there's some mix shift within that, with the higher margin revenue falling more than that total number, it still feels like there's like $40 million of incremental cost coming in, which if we were to annualize that, it's like 4% of your SG&A or more than 2% of revenue.","It -- that seems like a pretty good number relative to some investments and filling a few more open territories. Can you just help us understand what's -- first of all, is that directionally right? And what's really in that number? What are you investing in at such a high level in the back half of the year?","Craig Safian","Hey good morning Gary. It's Craig. So the way to think about it is you're probably a little high on your expense impact. It's probably a little bit lower, I think roughly in the $30-ish million range.","I think part of this is -- it's not all second half spending. The spending may have started in late Q1, certainly in Q2. And so annual -- you can't just double it to annualize it. Some of it is already baked into our run rate for 2019.","As Gene mentioned, with one example where in one of our sales units, we reduced the level of open territories from 6% to 2%. And so think about it as almost a 4% increase in the number of heads on board, and there's the frontline cost of those individuals. And then if we add that many more people, we might need more managers, we might have needed more recruiters to actually get them and see, et cetera.","And so the move of reducing open territories, which we firmly, firmly, firmly believe absolutely, pays off in the future, does have a cost in the upfront. And I think that is not the only thing that's impacting that cost line or the reduction in our EBITDA, but that is the most notable thing within that reduction, and so again just think about what the size of our sales force is, GBS is at 919 people, GTS is over 3,200 people. Modest changes against our assumptions in terms of percent of open territories can have a pretty sizable impact from a short-term P&L perspective. But again, we firmly believe, long-term, it pays off.","Gary Bisbee","So I guess that leads to the follow-up, which is just how do you weigh on a day-to-day basis when you're running the business, the concept of investing relative to delivering to your medium-term targets? Because this is now the second year in a row you won't hit that EBITDA growth target and it despite being well within the revenue range that you're targeting, and at some point -- I know there's growing frustration, certainly for me, I think from a lot of investors in this concept of constantly investing so much, but yet really not showing a lot of return on investment because the level of reinvestment remains so high.","Gene Hall","So Gary, it's Gene. So first, if you look at our performance, again GTS is growing really well. We've invested there. We've gotten great returns on it. Our Conferences business, the reason it has such record growth is because we've invested there, we've got great returns.","I talked about in the past in GBS where that -- we've been investing heavy, we know we're investing ahead. We know there's great incredible growth opportunities there. And as I've said before, we think we've reached that inflection point, where we're going to start getting those returns in GBS as we have in GTS and in our Conferences business.","So as we -- and we're not deciding to make new investments per se. Again, as Craig said, the biggest factor on the cost side is that we assumed a number -- a percentage of open territories. It was significantly better than last year. We had an improvement last year.","And it's across all three of our major sales forces. We're actually overachieving in terms of fewer open territories. That is great for the long-term growth. You can only get better growth if you get better retention with existing clients. And so it's a great thing to do, and we already have those territories. So it's not incremental that we just decided one day to have a whole another investment.","So again, just summarizing, we got great returns from GTS reinvestment we've made, great returns on GCS and we feel like we're at the beginning of seeing those returns for GBS as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning everyone. So a couple of questions on the productivity side. The -- within GBS, the productivity was minus 2,000 in Q1. It was up to plus 7,000 in Q2. The previous GBS guidance for double-digit growth had implied in it a productivity improvement to about 75,000. And I wanted to ask given the new guidance, what is implied in the new guidance?","Craig Safian","Hey, good morning, Bill. So -- there's really no change in the way to think about the productivity. The way we measure it is opening period headcount. And so again, to drive the roughly 10% growth on a $600 million, just below $600 million base, we have to drive the same level of NCVI and our opening number of headcount hasn't changed. So essentially, it's the same mass.","You're right in your calcs for Q1 and Q2. And again, we believe through a combination of improved retention rates and what we've seen in both Q1 and Q2 is very favorable. I think we said in Q1 for the contracts that came up for renewal, we were up close to 200 basis points in terms of the pure retention on those transactions. Same measure in Q2. We were up 270 basis points.","You will note that Q2 new business for GBS in total was up 16% year-over-year, that's coming off several quarters of a decline in new business on a year-over-year basis. And so again, if you kind of model forward, improve -- the continued improvements to retention and continued ramping of our new business, again, as the sales force seasons, as they get more comfortable selling GxL and as we get real momentum on GxL, that's the way we think about the path to still getting to that double-digit growth in GBS by the end of this year.","Bill Warmington","Okay. And then on the GTS side, the productivity last quarter grew 9% versus the 13% comp. In this quarter, productivity grew 2% versus an easier 10% comp. And I thought initially that that might be the more rapid closing of the open territories than expected, but it sounded like a lot of that was really on the GBS side. So I wanted to ask what was driving that lower productivity.","Craig Safian","Yeah sure. So we, as you know, we did have a modest deceleration in the GTS overall contract value growth rate. And again, 13.5% is still very, very strong and the productivity is still up 2% on a year-over-year basis, but given the modest deceleration in the quarter that's really what caused the modest deceleration in the productivity.","And again, we're up -- we have -- it was seventh consecutive quarter of productivity being up on a year-over-year basis but the modest decel impacted the productivity measure or said the other way, the productivity measure impacted the modest decel. You can look at it either way, but that's really what happened in the second quarter.","Bill Warmington","Got it, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Sorry, but I just wanted to go back to the margin expansion questions from earlier. If we look at 2020, it looks like your soft guidance is for flat margins next year. I would have thought if we're ending this year at double-digit CV growth in GBS, you talking about that potentially accelerating next year, we're off the headwinds from the shift from -- away from the legacy business, you're filling your open territories a little bit quicker than you thought, why shouldn't we see a little bit of margin expansion next year?","Craig Safian","Good morning, Jeff and thanks for the question. So again, we're not giving 2020 guidance at this point. Obviously, a lot of it will be determined upon where we land the year. So the bulk of our 2020 economics are determined by the contract value growth or the NCVI we deliver in both GTS and GBS through the second half of the year.","I'll be happy to go into immense and infinite detail around our EBITDA growth assumptions when we give the 2020 outlook, and we'll certainly provide all of the visibility and transparency in terms of being able to walk and reconcile the points you make. We're just not in a position right now where we're talking about the 2020 guidance or the margin outlook moving forward.","Gene Hall","And Jeff, I'd add that, the reason that I had that in my comments was that, we wanted to communicate that we know we've been investing ahead of CV growth in GBS and that we feel like we've reached a point now where we have the right base -- as I talked about earlier, the right number of sales people, the right products, et cetera, to where we can start getting returns out of that, which is what we're trying to communicate, as opposed to specific guidance where the margins are going to be next year.","Jeff Silber","Okay. Look forward to getting more detail as the year progresses. And then, just a quick numbers question. You mentioned the tax benefit impacting adjusted EPS in 2Q. What was the exact amount of that tax benefit impact on EPS?","Craig Safian","So roughly speaking, Jeff, I think it was about a $38 million benefit recorded on the income tax line.","Jeff Silber","Okay. That came back into the EPS number. All right. Thanks so much. ","Craig Safian","Yes. You got it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. So I just wanted to kind of circle back to GXL. What do you think The Street is undervaluing that would result in the ramp necessary to hit that double-digit growth? What do we not see sort of on the outside that you see on the inside from either a product-improvement standpoint or some other area?","Craig Safian","Hey, Joe. Good morning. It's Craig.","Joseph Foresi","Good morning.","Craig Safian","Joe, I think it's -- we've always had confidence in the quality of the product. It really is a very strong, high-value proposition at a relatively low cost product, very consistent with our IT products, our supply chain products and our marketing products. And I think what really gives us confidence is two things.","So one is the continued ramp of GXL new business. And again, it's one of the reasons why we've consistently been breaking that out for investors, so that investors can see the progress we're making. And again, it can get a little masked in the total numbers, because there's a lot of moving parts, but when you isolate out what's happening with GXL, particularly on the new business side, in the second quarter, we sold $29 million worth of new business and that was across every enterprise function where we've launched the new GXL product.","And if I look at the growth on a year-over-year basis across all those enterprise functions, the growth was very strong. As Gene mentioned, overall, GXL new business growth was up 51% year-over-year and in just about every enterprise function, we were close to that average. So very, very strong growth. So the market uptake continues to be strong.","And again, our sales teams continue to get more and more repetitions, if you will, of selling the product and they're just getting better and better and better at it. You couple that with the improvements we've seen in retention and that comment is both on the GXL retention and also on legacy product retention. And again, we've seen very strong -- things that have come up for renewal in the first half of the year, a very strong improvement in our retention rates.","And again, if you flow that through, which we believe should flow through for the balance of the year, and you continue to ramp up on the GXL, again, given we're not selling onesie, twosies of these things, we're selling millions and millions or tens of millions of dollars of these each and every quarter, that's really what we're seeing underneath the covers. And again, we're trying to make that as transparent as possible as well.","Joseph Foresi","Got it. And then, just as follow up. Maybe you could just remind us of the investment schedule in GXL. What are you currently investing in? Do you feel like you've made the proper investments at this point? Because I know that we, a couple of -- I think it goes back to after the closing, saw a spike in investments, in the pull forward and all the rest of that stuff.","So maybe you can just help us with the investment schedule? What are you investing in now? Do you feel like the investments are now complete, or are they continually ongoing? Is it mostly in sales? Just a little bit more color on the CapEx that you're putting back into the business. Thanks.","Gene Hall","Hey, Joe. It's Gene. The largest single investment is the sales force. And we've added to sales capacity, because that's key to getting long-term sustained growth and we've got that in place. Now that we're doing and seeing -- and again, as the business grows, that will continue to grow. We've also invested in getting the right products in place, the right service delivery teams, the retention gets up and all those things, as Craig mentioned, are working, meaning GXL is selling very well.","The retention of the first ones that come for renewal have been very strong. The retention programs are also affecting the legacy products as well, where, as Craig mentioned, our retention is up there as well. And so, the key investments really are in -- basically, the most is in sales, to a lesser degree, in service delivery and in product.","Joseph Foresi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Your GTS headcount growth in the quarter accelerated to 14.5%. I recall previously, you were looking to slow your GTS headcount growth and rely more on productivity gains to drive CV growth. So can you talk about your overall strategy in GTS between balancing headcount growth and productivity gains over the next, call it, two to four quarters?","Gene Hall","So, George, I'll answer the first half of the question, which is, the way we think about adding capacity to our sales force is that, we decide a certain number of territories that we want to add each year and the phasing of value in those territories through the year. And then we assume that there's a certain number of opens that we talked about.","And so, the story in GTS is the same as we talked about in GBS, which is, we gave you -- the guidance we gave you on the sales force headcount growth was based on a number of territories. As Craig and I mentioned, we actually reduced the number sales territories in GTS as well as in GBS and that's why the sales growth -- the sales force growth is a little higher, because we're not giving you the number of territories, giving you the number of actual people on board.","Craig Safian","Yes, and George, good morning. Just to continue the thought and to answer the second part of your question. So it's not a change in our territory growth assumptions is, we were just more efficient and more effective at filling open territories, and we had that many -- that 14% more heads on board compared to where we were last quarter. And yes, it's modestly a point or two above what we had guided for the full year.","For the next few quarters, we expect to run roughly in this range given the low level of open territories and the same level of territory growth. Again, we remain focused on driving increased sales productivity consistently. As we mentioned, we've done it seven quarters in a row of year-over-year productivity improvement, and we will continue to be focused on striking that right balance between headcount growth and productivity improvements. And again, as we accelerate on GBS, I think, we'll employ that same kind of thinking the way we want to get productivity. But we also want to make sure, we add, so that we can still capture that huge market opportunity and drive sustained long-term double-digit growth.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. And then with respect to open territories, can you confirm that most of the upside in filling those territories did in fact come from GBS? And perhaps quantify, maybe the number of open territories that you filled versus what you had initially expected and how you expect the better filling of these territories to impact sales over the next year.","Craig Safian","Yes. Sure, George. So the way to think about it is we've actually, if you look at our three major selling units, so GTS, GBS and then the sales teams that sell the conferences, we've reduced the level of open territories in each of those segments. And again, you could argue in GTS, we're seeing the benefits of that and that return is paying off.","In Conferences, we're seeing the benefit. And in GBS, we're starting to see contract value growth accelerate. And as Gene mentioned, we really expect to start seeing the returns from all those investments in 2020 and beyond. The way to think about it just quantitatively is we've planned -- we've historically had roughly 5% open territories in GTS and GBS. And so a two or three-point reduction in open territories can impact the headcount growth by that same 2% or 3%.","And so as we've moved through this year in particular, we've been really efficient and effective at filling open territories at a faster rate than we had previously. On the GTS side, it's probably a couple points better. On the GBS side, it's a little more notable in terms of more than a couple of points better. And again, each of those improvements is accreting the growth rate that you're seeing in headcount. And now that we filled those territories, we expect to kind of run at that level -- at least we've baked into our outlook running at that level for the balance of the year.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Gene Hall for closing remarks.","Gene Hall","So summarizing today's call. For the second quarter of 2019, we continue to deliver strong performances across our business. We again delivered double-digit growth in each of our business segments, Research, Conferences and Consulting. We are well positioned for sustained double-digit growth. We expect continued sustained double-digit growth in GTS, we're at an inflection point in GBS and Conferences and Consulting are on a strong path. Our future at Gartner remains bright. Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"9859":["Gartner Inc.

Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Shipman","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner's fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings conference call. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond. This call will begin with a discussion of Q4 and full year financial results disclosed in today's press release. We will also discuss our outlook for the company, including our newly issued guidance for 2012, followed by an opportunity for you to ask questions. I'd like to remind everyone that the press release is available on our website, that url is www.gartner.com.","Before we begin we need to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

If you haven't done so already, please make sure you contact my assistant Germaine Scott at 203-316-3411 to register for the event and she'll provide you with the logistics.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond. Chris?","Chris Lafond","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We ended 2011 with double-digit growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow. Our results again demonstrate the continued successful execution of our strategy, our ability to consistently deliver on the long-term financial objectives we communicated over the past several years and our overall importance for the strategic IT initiatives of our clients.","We saw a continuation of the strong trends in our key business metrics that we delivered during the first three quarters in the year. Year-over-year contract value growth remained strong and retention rates ended at or near all-time highs. Consulting backlog were 8% since the end of Q3 and both attendees and exhibitors at our events increased by double-digits year-over-year.","Demand for our services was robust across all of our business segments in the fourth quarter. Our strong topline performance and effective execution and capitalizing on the operating leverage in our business allowed us to once again expand, both our growth contribution and EBITDA margin. As a result, we delivered significant growth in earnings, both in Q4 and for full year.","In the fourth quarter normalized EBITDA increased 17% year-over-year and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was up 14%. For the full year, we delivered normalized EBITDA of $279, up 21% from 2010. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.39, up 45% from last year. With the strong finish to 2011, we are well-positioned for continued growth in 2012.","I'll now provide a review of our three business segments for the fourth quarter and full year and then conclude with a discussion of our outlook for 2012. Starting with research. Fourth quarter research revenue was up 14% to $263 million with negligible impact in foreign exchange in the quarter. For the full year, research revenue grew 17% to over $1 billion. On an FX neutral basis research revenue grew 14% for the full year in 2011.","The margin in this segment increased 220 basis points year-over-year to 66.9% in the fourth quarter, as our strong execution continues to capitalize on the operating leverage in this business. For the full year the contribution margin in our research business grew by 210 basis points to 67.4%. All of our key research business metrics remains fairly strong in the fourth quarter.","Contract value grew a record level of $1.116 billion, a growth of 14% year-over-year. As was the case throughout 2011, our growth in contract value in Q4 was extremely broad-based with all geographies, client-sizes and industry segments delivering strong growth year-over-year.","New business again increased year-over-year, continuing the trends that we've seen since late 2009. The new business mix was balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrade to existing clients. While our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting, approximately 85% of our contract value growth came from volume with the balance coming from price increases.","This volume growth reflects our success at continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients. As a result, we ended the quarter with 12,427 client organizations, up 7% year-over-year. As for pricing, we've consistently increased our price list by3% to 6% per year on an annual basis since 2005 and we expect to do so again in 2012.","Our client retention rate ended the quarter at 82%, and we've maintained client retention near record highs for six quarters in a row. In addition to retaining our research clients and an impressive rate, the clients we retained continue to increase their spending with Gartner. Wallet retention increased almost 200 basis points year-over-year to 99%. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our larger clients. As we've discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a four-quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality.","In summary, our research segment continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter. We grew our contract value by $140 million on an FX neutral basis year-over-year. We continue to see high levels of demand from clients and we expect continued acceleration in revenue and contract value growth over time. We remain confident in our ability to deliver 15% to 20% annual revenue growth in this business over the long term.","Turning now to events. Events revenue in the fourth quarter increased 22% year-over-year on a reported basis and 23% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. During the fourth quarter, we held 12 events with 22,500 attendees compared to 12 events with 18,484 attendees held in the fourth quarter of 2010. Total attendees at our events during Q4 and on a same event basis were up 12% year-over-year and exhibitors were up 25%. ","For the full year, revenue for our event business increased 21% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis, at the 60 event held in 2012 versus the 56 event held in 2010, attendees were up 15% and exhibitors were up 19% year-over-year. On a same event basis in 2011, attendees were up 12% and exhibitors were up 17%.","For the full year 2011, the events growth contribution margin was 45% versus 46% in 2010. With our strong revenue growth in 2011, we took the opportunity to make selected investments to further strengthen our events portfolio,","Moving on to consulting, revenues in our consulting business were essentially flat in the fourth quarter with the negligible impact from foreign exchange. For the full year, consulting revenue grew 2% to $308 million and were flat excluding foreign exchange. Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our consulting business, ended the quarter at $101 million, which represents over 8% growth sequentially and a healthy four months' of backlog. Additionally, our pipeline looks equally solid again as we begin with New Year.","Billable headcount of 481 was up 2% fourth quarter of 2010. This reflects our focus on managing resources to demand we saw earlier in 2011. Fourth quarter utilization was over 68%, up 730 basis points from the prior quarter and revenue per billable headcount remained above $400,000 per year, ending the quarter at $454,000.","Moving down to rest of the income statement. During the fourth quarter, our total gross contribution margin increased by one percentage point year-over-year to 58%. For the full year, our total gross contribution margins increased to 140 basis points to 59%. These increases were due primarily to the successful execution of our strategy to capitalize on the high incremental margins and operating leverage inherent in our research business. ","SG&A increased by $15 million year-over-year during the fourth quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to the growth in our sales force. As of December 31, we had 1215 quarter-bearing sales associates as compared to 1049 a year ago. For the full year we added 219 sales people which represent 21% growth and were slightly above our long term target referring our sales force by 15% to 20% per year.","Our strong recruiting pipeline and quality of the potential candidates allowed us to be at higher for 2012 during the end of Q4. Finally G&A was essentially flat year-over-year in absolute dollars and dropped 160 basis points as a percent of revenue in Q4. For the full year G&A was up about 4% year-over-year but again dropped to 150 basis points as a percent of revenue. We continue to tightly control G&A costs across the entire company in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Moving on to earnings, we delivered another strong quarter of solid earnings growth. Normalized EBITDA was $85 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% year-over-year and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.46, up 24% year-over-year. Our normalized EBITDA margin increased to 80 basis points to 19.8%. As expected our Q4 2011 GAAP diluted earnings per share includes minimal non-cash amortization costs associated with AMR and Burton. This trend continues to reflect our commitment to improving margins while also investing in the growth of our business.","For the full year Normalized EBITDA was $279 million, up 21% year-over-year and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.39, up 45% year-over-year. Diluted EPS for the full-year 2011 included acquisition-related charges of $0.04 per share compared to $0.14 per share in 2010. Our normalized EBITDA margin increased to 110 basis points to 19% consistent with our annual goal of 50 basis points to 150 basis points of normalized EBITDA margin expansion.","Turning now to cash. Our strong performance for the full year translated into an increase in cash flow mainly driven by cash from operations, which increased by 24% to $256 million. This number included certain landlord reimbursement for capital spending on our facilities. Excluding those, cash from operations increased by 18% year-over-year. Over the long-term, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow substantially greater than our net income, given our tight cash management and the negative working capital characteristics of our research business.","During the fourth quarter, we utilized our cash to return to capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We repurchased over 2 million shares at a total cost of almost $71 million, including our repurchase of ValueAct's remaining shares on December 13. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and cash position with net debt of $57 million.","Our current credit facility runs through December 2015, and at this time provides us with over $375 million of remaining borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value.","We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunity as a potential use of cash. In absence of appropriate acquisition opportunities, we believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital. We have $293 million remaining under our Board authorization.","Now, let me turn to our business outlook for 2012. Based on the strong business trends, we experienced in 2011 and the expectation of a reasonable economic environment in 2012, we believe our businesses are well-positioned for another year of strong growth. For the full year 2012, we expect total revenues will grow by 9% to 12% to approximately $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, we expect total revenue growth of 11% to 15%.","Projected revenues by segment can be found in our press release, but would note that we expect growth in each of our three segments during 2012, with research revenue expected to be up 12% to 14%, consulting revenue up 1% to 7% and events revenue up 8% to 14%. I would point out that this guidance includes a 2 point to 3 point negative impact from foreign exchange.","On an FX neutral basis, our projected growth rates for each segment are as follows. In research, we expect 14% to 16% revenue growth, as you know research revenue is primarily driven by the prior year's contract value growth. In consulting, we expect revenue growth to be between 3% and 10%, which would return this segment to our long-term expectations. And finally in events, we expect FX neutral revenue growth of 10% to 17%, this would be another strong year for events with revenue growth above our long-term targets for the third straight year.","In terms of foreign exchange impacts on revenues, our guidance is based on the spot rates in early January. We've made no attempts in our guidance to anticipate any strengthening or weakening of the dollar from the actual foreign exchange rates in early January.","Moving down to income statement, we expect normalized EBITDA for the full year 2012 to be between $315 million and $335 million, an increase of 13% to 20% over 2011. And we expect our normalized EBITDA margin to again increase between 50 basis points and 150 basis points in the coming year.","In 2012, we expect the cost associated with stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $35 million to $36 million. Total deprecation and amortization should be approximately $29 million to $30 million, inclusive of the amortization of acquisition intangible assets. The intangible amortization associated with the acquisition of AMR Burton will equate to approximately $0.02 per share for 2012.","We expect interest expense of approximately $10 million to $11 million and other expense of $2 million to $3 million, and we're projecting an annual effective tax rate between 32% and 33%. And our guidance is based on average fully diluted shares outstanding of between 97 million and 98 million shares for the year. Note that our tax rate may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of discrete items.","Our GAAP earnings guidance for 2012, as per EPS, will be between $1.63 and $1.79 per share. We also expect to grow our cash flow as we drive growth in our research business. In 2012, we expect cash from operations of $285 million to $305 million, capital expenditures of $46 million to $48 million and free cash flow of $239 million to $257 million. Thus, we expect to grow our free cash flow by 12% to 20% in 2012, and generate free cash flow per share of $2.41 to $2.62 substantially above our income per share.","I'd like to note that cash from operations include $16 million, to be received as a tenant improvement allowance in connection with the previously disclosed lease arrangements on our Stamford headquarter. And the $16 million in the related cost of these improvements are also reflected in our capital expenditures, despite being reimbursed by the landlord. These amounts are not expected to have any impact on free cash flow during the life of the renovation project, which should end in late 2012 and are not expected to recur.","While our policies provide annual, but not quarterly guidance, I'd like to provide some additional information to allow for an understanding of the seasonality and other factors that will impact our revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis. Full year research revenue will be fairly evenly distributed across each quarter of 2012, and approximately 24% of the full year revenue in Q1.","Consulting revenue will be lowest in Q1 with 23% of the full year revenue, and highest in Q4 with 28%. For events more than 50% of the full revenue will be recognized in Q4, because our Fall Symposium series will be held in that quarter. At this point, we're trying to hold 62 to 65 events in 2012 as compared 60 in 2011.","The phasing of our events calendar will be similar to 2011 in Q1 and Q3. Each representing approximately 10% of the full year revenue for this segment, given the seasonality of our events and consulting business, we expect earnings per share in each of Q1 and Q3 to be roughly 20% of the full year EPS respectively. We also expect to earn roughly 35% of the annual EPS in Q4, again primarily due to the timing of our events.","Finally, I'd like to spend a moment on the impact of foreign exchange, as it relates to our reported contract value. As we have communicated to you in the past, research contract value is reported on an FX neutral basis throughout each year. We do this, so you can understand the true organic growth in our research segment.","In January of each year, we restate the opening contract value and current foreign exchange rates. As a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2011, contract value at January 1, 2012, is approximately $8 million lower than the $1.116 billion reported on December 31. As a result, $1.108 billion is the baseline figure you should use for this comparison purpose, when judging contract value growth in 2012.","So to summarize, we delivered great results for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2011. Demand for our services is strong and as a result we generated double-digit revenue growth, and our key business metric remained strong throughout 2011. Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness coupled with positive operating leverage inherent by businesses delivered strong margin expansion and we generated substantial cash flow.","As always, we are actively exploring strategic alternatives for deploying our cash. We will continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we expect to repurchase shares throughout 2012. Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in 2011, we established a solid foundation for delivering another strong year for revenue and earnings growth in 2012. We are well-positioned for double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing return to our shareholders over the long-term.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene, who will share his thoughts on the outlook for the coming year. Gene?","Gene Hall","Good morning, everyone. As Chris has discussed, we achieved strong 2011 performance. Our 2011 results continue the positive trend of growth that we delivered since early 2009 with a successful and consistent execution of our strategy. We had strong growth across all geographies, all client-sizes and all industry segments.","IT is one of the most important drivers of growth and comparative advantage for virtually every institution in the world, but IT is also complex and continuously evolving. As a result, IT professionals need expert assistance and insight, to help to make the critical business decisions that they face virtually every day. This includes advice on managing IT for business success as well as how to best purchase the $3.8 trillion that they're expected to buy during 2012. The same is true for supply chain professionals.","Gartner is the best and most cost-effective resource that IT and supply chain professionals can turn to for that help. Our assistance often makes the difference between success and failure for our clients. At the same time, we benefit from having a vast untapped market opportunity for our services, which we estimate at $45 billion.","There are hundreds of thousands of IT and supply chain professionals, who could potentially be Gartner clients, but have never been educated on the values that we can provide. We have the right strategy to capture this opportunity. As some of you know, the fundamental to our strategy are to create extraordinary research insight, to build strong sales capability, to deliver high-value differentiated offerings, to provide world-class service and to continually improve our operational effectiveness. This consistent strategy is driving our growth and will allow us to maintain sustained double-digit growth overtime.","During the fourth quarter, more than 5,000 CIOs attended our symposium events and I had the opportunity to meet with many of our clients there. These technology leaders are looking for solutions for mobile, for social, for cloud, for bid data and of course for traditional areas such as cost optimization. These leaders are driving the performance of their organizations and they see Gartner is central to their success. As a result, attendance at our events has been growing as well as the value that client see in Gartner.","During January, I had the opportunity to meet with our sales leaders from around the world at our 2012 Kickoff Meeting. Our sales leaders, representing clients from all geographies, all industries and all sizes had an incredible level of enthusiasm. They're excited about Gartner, the value we provide our clients and our vast market opportunity.","I've never been more confident or excited about our prospects for accelerated and sustained growth that I am today. Gartner is a strongest company it's ever been. The Gartner brand is into classify itself. Our products, services and people are superior to the competition and we have a great business model. We delivered double-digit growth in 2011 and we're placed for even greater success in 2012 and beyond.","So to summarize, there are three points I'd like you to take away from today's call. First, our business performance was strong during Q4 and throughout 2011, providing great momentum as we enter 2012. The selling environment is great and we delivered double-digit contract value growth.","Our research business added more net new organizations than ever before. Our events attendance was up 13% and the quality of our attendees has never been better. In consulting, we generated strong backlog across all geographies and industries. With the continued focus on our proven strategy, we will continue our positive momentum for the coming year and beyond.","Second, our business model is attractive with high renewal rates, strong cash flow and great incremental margins. Third, we are well positioned to accelerate the growth of our research business and achieve 15% to 20% annual growth in that segment over the long-term, as well as growth in our events and consulting businesses consistent with our long-term targets.","We have the leading brand in IT and supply chain research, a strong value proposition for our clients, great operational capabilities and a vast untapped market opportunity. We're in a strong position to continue generating double-digit revenue growth and expanding margins during 2012 and over the long-term.","With that, we'll now take questions.","Operator","Question-and-Answer Session","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","So, Gene, can you talk a little bit more about the 15% to 20% long-term revenue growth target within research? I mean, obviously, you haven't been in that range or even been in the high-end of that range certainly for a while. And what gets you to the higher-end of that range?","Gene Hall","So I think what gets us to the higher end of that range is focusing on increasing sales force productivity and also making sure that we grow our sales force in the kind of the range we talked about is those two things. The market opportunity is clearly there and our operational performance is clearly there, so it's really focused on that sales productivity and the growth of our sales force.","And as you know, the sales productivity is one of the big focuses that we have. And as you saw, we actually in terms of sales force growth, grew a little bit of a top-end of our range last year, as we saw a lot of really good talent that we'll bring onboard a little bit early for 2012.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Would you then not expect to see an acceleration of research revenue growth in 2012?","Gene Hall","So, Peter, as you know, the way our revenue recognition works is that the sales people sell a contract and then we recognize that revenue ratably for that contract. So in a simple level, the way I think about it is the contract buy in 2011 turns into revenues in 2012, what we sell in 2012 in terms of contract value, turns into revenues in 2013. And so the kind of research revenues for 2012 are based on the contract value brought in 2011. So what we sell in contract value during 2012 will really affect the research revenues in 2013.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","Right. And so therefore, logically we might expect to see an acceleration in contract value growth in '12, would that be fair?","Gene Hall","We certainly would like to see that.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","In terms of hiring plans for 2012, same level, same percentage growth rate that we saw last year?","Gene Hall","Again, we're expecting during 2012 to have a sales force growth in 15% to 20% range. So it's exactly in target of late last year.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","But not committing to be at the higher-end of the range?","Gene Hall","No.","Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray","And then, Chris, this will be the last question. More to do on the G&A line, you've had a lot of success in terms of holding those across and getting the margin leverage from that. So I guess, how much more is there to do on that front? And then beyond that, where does the margin leverage going forward come from?","Chris Lafond","Yes, Peter, good question I think. As you've seen over the years we've done a good job of being able to maintain, in some cases the absolute dollars we spent, but certainly in every case as a percent of revenue continue to come down. Our expectation for the foreseeable future is that G&A cost will grow slower than overall revenue, so as a percent of revenue you'll continue to see G&A continue to fall. So we still think there's ample opportunity to do that over the next few years and you should continue to see similar trends you've seen over the past few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line our Dave Lewis with JPMorgan.","Dave Lewis - JPMorgan","First question is with the events business, can you guys provide a little more detail on what's driving the strong growth there. And is there an opportunity or is there any chance for that up sell there into research business, could pick up going forward. I know about 50% of those clients or attendees do not have a research subscription. But what are your thoughts there?","Gene Hall","So basically what's driving the growth our events business is two things, one is just the fundamental value proposition that we have at Gartner which is IT people and supply chain people, having similar issues. And I mentioned some of the things earlier today, things like: How do I deal with global computing? What I'll do with cloud computing? How does the social computing apply to my business? Can I use big data and business intelligence?","As well as again there is always a focus on cost production and things like that. And same thing is with supply chain. And so you have people that have these problems they want to debate, need to solve. They're being charged by the business to solve and they need help. And they see Gartner as a great source that helps. And they see events as a source that help just like the see research and consulting. And that's one piece that's driving our events business growth. It's just the kind of market needs.","The second one is that we're executing very well. We basically have done a great job in terms of marketing our events business to prospects. And so it's the combination of this need to be adoptive with our clients. And the fact they see that we have a strong value preposition with them and that we've been executing very well in terms of getting those clients to our events.","I'll add to that too. We've actually getting them to the events and when they're actually at the events, we ask people to score how we're dealing with them. And the value that clients place in our events, it's never been higher. It's been growing up year after year. And in 2011, it's the highest its ever been. So now we are getting there. But they're seeing great value.","And that ties into your last point which is this not an up sell in opportunity? Absolutely, as you mentioned there is a sizable fraction of our event clients who are not Gartner research clients. But they can do our event, they learn more about Gartner and it is a great opportunity when they learn more about Gartner to sell them research services as well.","Dave Lewis - JPMorgan","And last one from me, can you just comment on the Legacy Burton and now Gartner supply chain business. Would you be able to tell us that they are outperforming the Legacy business? And the second half of the question on supply chain is that business expanded market opportunities significantly? I believe when it was acquired you had about a third-year sales reps that had relationship in the adjacent CIO office. How should we think about penetration there in terms of the growth opportunity going forward?","Gene Hall","After we acquired AMR, we launched a new set of products that are more consistent with what we do in our IT space. Those products have been extremely well received. Basically the clients of the Legacy products that are happy with them are doing great and we're happy with that. But in terms of future growth, we really focus on these new products which are doing very, very well. Overall, that business is just doing great. It's going really nicely.","And in terms of penetration, it has a very, very small tiny penetration in terms of the total market opportunities. So we have a real huge opportunity there. And again, it's getting terrific growth and if anything we should see the growth accelerating.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Riggs with William Blair.","Robert Riggs - William Blair","Just a follow-up on the sales force. It sounds like you're able to hire a little more people than you had anticipated that there is a lot of good talent out there. Is attrition kind of trending as expected, and have you made any changes in programs that are onboard in retention to drive that sales force productivity higher?","Gene Hall","Basically as you said, what we're seeing is a lot of great talent out there and we've been very successful in tracking that talent to Gartner which is why we are ahead of our plan in sales hiring. And if people are going out to the door hiring more, you can't get ahead of the game. So we've actually had a very good retention. It's been very consistent over the years in terms of our sales people.","Now we're working on that. We continue to work on getting that down because again we want to retain sales people. And so even though we think we have very good retention today, we'd think we can that even better which would just help in terms of our hiring and the tenure sales force. So we're working at the issue and we have done things like you've said. So we do have good on board products, we have great recruiting products to identify people that are we think are highly likely to be successful in our environment and then strong on boarding and development programs for those folks who want to get to on board.","But I think our on boarding and professional development programs are as good as or better than any other company I have ever seen. And we get that feed routinely when our sales people come on board.","Robert Riggs - William Blair","And then as for the consulting business, you've been working through this managing partner strategy for a while a now. Could you give us an update for that piece of the business are you finding the people that you want there and is that kind of going in line with expectations?","Gene Hall","So as you pointed out in consulting, one of our major issue in consulting is to have a team of managing partners that sort of drive that business. We started basically with none of those peoples several years ago and we've been adding up and we're up to approximately 70 of those managing partners today. And that's been a tremendous successful program.","We've been able to identify great people. Those people come on board and there their productivity has been exactly what we'd expect. And in fact as we did, we actually want to full complement of those managing partners on board that will really help the overall performance of the consulting business. And so real challenge is we went from zero to now 17, we need to get to quite a few more before we're at the full capacity there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Bird with Lazard.","William Bird - Lazard","Gene, I was wondering, if you could just talk about what you're seeing in Europe right now?","Gene Hall","So as Chris and I both mentioned, we saw strong double-digit growth across all of our geographies, all of our industries and all client sizes. And so that's what we are seeing.","William Bird - Lazard","And have you seen any change in tone of business as you've rolled into 2012?","Gene Hall","Basically, as you can see from our guidance, we're very enthusiastic about the prospects for 2012. So that applies everywhere.","William Bird - Lazard","And what were your diluted shares at yearend and given the guidance it seems like $97 million, $98 million shares, are you just assuming that you built cash and it's not deployed?","Chris Lafond","Diluted shares for the fourth quarter were about $97 million. And what we have traditionally said over the time is that at a bear minimum we shares back to offset the impact of our equity programs. And we will continue to do that at a minimum. We, as you know, will continue to generate significant cash.","And we look to two things for that cash; one would be acquisitions where they make sense. And as you know we are pretty thoughtful about acquisitions and we'll continue to be that way. But if we find them we will use them there, and if not we will continue to buy shares back in the open market. And so the guidance we gave is to kind of remain roughly where we are. But should we get more aggressive that number could come down over the time.","William Bird - Lazard","So just to clarify that $97 million, I know that was your weighted average was that also the quarter end number?","Chris Lafond","Hold on for one second Bill and I will get that for you. Why don't we go and do another question.","William Bird - Lazard","And just a follow-on Gene, how do you think about the prospective growth in research client organizations and how you deploy the sales force in effect?","Gene Hall","So there is huge growth opportunity in client organizations. We think there is more than 100,000 actual client organizations out there, and we have a tiny fraction of those today. So we think there is growth in both number of organizations, like you saw in 2011. We also think that there is a huge opportunity to penetrate the existing organizations much deeper as well.","So we're trying to have growth opportunity everywhere we look, and we're still looking for shares.","Chris Lafond","We might have to get back to you on that share count for the end of the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sutherland with Northland Capital Markets.","Bill Sutherland - Northland Capital Markets","I'm curious about your outlook on consulting and your confidence of a real pickup and momentum there. I see the backlog, obviously strong. But there was somewhat of a strong at the end of '10. So I'm just wondering if there is anything in addition just to the backlog trend that gives you confidence for the consulting guidance.","Gene Hall","I guess there are two things. One is that the convert kind of looking at what's going on in operation of the business and we feel very comfortable with the guidance we gave in terms of operationally. The second thing is the point we mentioned earlier about managing partners. We added a number of managing partners through the last year.","Again, as we look at it, the productivity of those people has been very good. We've been able to attract people and get them up to speed. And we kind of extrapolate into '12, the performance that we'd expect from the few we brought on Board in 2011, we see we have performance right in the range to be what we had in our guidance.","Bill Sutherland - Northland Capital Markets","I know you don't want to say there is an endpoint as far as the number of managing partners as a percent of your total headcount there. But are you a quarter of the way there or 70 or half way?","Gene Hall","Just to give you a flavor for it, we are at about 70 today and we are looking something like 110 to 120 eventually. So we've still got ways to go, which is why you see there mid-to-low single-digit growth in consulting expectations.","Bill Sutherland - Northland Capital Markets","And then one last one on the events. On the new events, is that just a total add or are there anything dropped and then roughly size-wise what are the expectations?","Chris Lafond","There is a couple of them that will be dropped. So there is probably a net five in, a couple out to get your kind of the three delta. If you think about where we're positioned now with the portfolio, we have a pretty solid portfolio in many of the mature markets like the U.S. where we still have plenty of opportunities to launch more around the world. That's the strategy we will have over time to continue to launch existing events in other parts of the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Karimzad with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs","On the sales force ramp, can you, Gene, give us a sense for when a great salesperson starts on day one, how many quarters do you expect for them to ramp before they become accretive to the overall productivity?","Gene Hall","So the way you can think about our sales force is when we hire somebody in their first year, they have less than average productivity. In their second year, they have average productivity. So their selling is up to average by the time they are in their second full year. And again, that then will get reflected in contract value, which then in the next year actually turns into revenue.","So if we hire somebody today, their first year will be below average productivity. Their second year's average productivity that will be next year and then that turns to contract value in that year. And in the third year, it actually translates into revenue for the business.","So because of the pro-rated recognition of revenue that we use, it takes a while after you sell it, but we feel really good about the fact that we get our people, we hire new people, they do sell in the first year, but they are full average productivity by the time they're in their second full year.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs","So theoretically, if you start hitting that high-teens growth rate in the sales force third quarter, it wouldn't be until third or fourth quarter this year that you will see that start to flow through in contract value growth.","Gene Hall","That would be consistent with what I just described, yes. That's a good way to think about it.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs","Chris, on the free cash flow for '11, you finished the year with the operating metrics kind of towards the high end of your outlook. The free cash flow came in a bit closer to low end. Can you just walk through what the delta was?","Chris Lafond","Just on the free cash flow, when you look free cash flow, there are a couple of things. The cash taxes in the time of cash taxes affect that a bit. What we have over the past few years is, if you look back over four, five years, very little cash taxes and in some cases refunds and slowly that's creeping up in terms of become a cash tax payer. It's certainly nowhere near at the level that we have on the face of the P&L. So our effective tax rate is obviously much higher than our cash tax rate. But having said that, it creeped up a little bit and that's probably the vast majority of the real delta that we see.","The other thing that we've talked about over time that you will continue to see in our cash is that over the past four or five years we've done a really good job of continuing to improve the effectiveness of our cash collection efforts. And we've got a lot of benefit out of that over the past few years. We're starting to see that stabilized now, we're at a very nice high level in terms of how quickly to collect cash and so we're not seeing the continued one-time benefits of improving. We're starting to see it kind of get to a normal run rate.","So those are the few things that are starting to affect the cash flow a little bit in terms of how much additional year-over-year growth we get. But as I mentioned earlier, we're still expecting good strong cash flow growth, well in the double-digit and again significantly higher than net income over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leben with Robert W. Baird.","Dan Leben - Robert W. Baird","Gene, just could you talk in the fourth quarter within the consulting business. What you saw within the contract authorization portion versus the other parts of consulting?","Gene Hall","So basically, in the fourth quarter of '10 the contract optimization business was extremely strong in fourth quarter 2010. In fourth quarter 2011 we had a strong quarter, but relative to the extremely strong performance in 2010, it didn't look like as good.","Dan Leben - Robert W. Baird","So when you look out to the forecast for next year with the utilization coming up nice in the fourth quarter. Is that the high end of the guidance range on consulting, is that essentially normalized utilization of these types of levels, maybe a little higher with a little bit of headcount growth, I just want to understand the dynamics within the range. What the possible outcomes are?","Gene Hall","So utilization would be at the high end. What you said is exactly right which is if the revenues with the high end utilization lookout would be the high end as well in consulting.","Chris Lafond","The range in consulting as we talked about every year is also a factor of our contract optimization business. As you know that business tends to be a little more lumpy. And there is things that happened that don't recur et cetera. So at the various ranges of the guidance there's that business but, Dan, as Gene mentioned that range around the utilization as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","So on the sales force growth expectations 15% to 20%. I just wanted to try and tie that in with obviously all that is organic growth. I want to tie that in with what your pipeline looks like on the M&A front? And just trying to understand where the opportunities are in that pipeline that you see? And are there any good opportunities to acquire companies that already have the sales force with the productivity in place?","Gene Hall","So basically first, we believe we can sustainably grow our sales force organically in the 15% to 20% range. So any acquisitions we did would be above and beyond that. And so there are both great organic growth opportunities. In terms of the M&A front, we actively tracked many companies and we think there are lot of opportunities out there. That it has to be the right company at the right price with the right fit. And those have happened in the last few years, we've had three, in fact we had two in one month because it happened at the right time with AMR and Burton. And so basically, as we've said, one of the uses of our cash is for acquisitions but only if the price is right and it fits right.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","Obviously, you guys have already shown, you guys have managed to grow the sales force pretty nicely in the double-digit range within that long-term guidance. Can you just help us understand again sort of the profile of who these sales people are and where you're hiring them from? Just to trying to get a little more comfort on the ability to continue to hire 15% to 20% additional sales force year-over-year.","Gene Hall","Yes, basically, what we're looking for are basic sales skills. It doesn't take technology. It basically takes great sales skills. There is a essentially unlimited market of people that have great sales skills out there. And we found, if anything we're getting better actually at both identifying the right people and attracting them to Gartner. Our recruiting organization is really terrific and had done a great job with that.","And there is such a vast army of sales people around the world that have great sales skills. And Gartner such a great place to be if you are a sales person. And we have no doubt in our ability to continue to grow our sales force in the 15% to 20% a year for essentially forever.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","And I guess, what is the churn being like on the sales force. I mean what is the rate relative to historical that you've seen today?","Gene Hall","So basically our churn of the sales to the attrition of sales force has been virtually unchanged over the last few years. It's been very steady. Even with the change in the economy it's been very steady. Again, Gartner is a very attractive place for sales people to be. And people want to be here as your sales person.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","And just lastly housekeeping question, I apologize if you said it before, what's the tax rate implied in the guidance of '12?","Gene Hall","32% to 33% is what we have in the range of our guidance.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian Shipman for closing remarks.","Brian Shipman","Before I make remark, Chris, wanted to clarify on one question.","Chris Lafond","So just to follow-up on Bill's question on the share count, so let me just share a few data points. Our basic weighted average share count at the end of the Q4 was 94.7 million, our basic ending share count in absolute terms was 93.3 million and our diluted weighted average was 97 million. So those stats should give you a sense of the shares as we ended the quarter and how that will look in 2012. And just another point on shares, remember that we do issue shares for our equity programs during Q1. And as we talked about, we continue to repurchase shares in the open market.","Brian Shipman","Thanks, Chris. And one last plug here for our Investor Day on February 16, in New York City. Registration is required in advance. If you haven't done so already, either contact me directly or my assistant Germaine Scott, her number is 203-316-3411.

Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Shipman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Call. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Lafond. This call will include a discussion of Q4 and full year 2013 financial results as disclosed in today's press release. We will also go through our initial outlook for 2014.

With that, I would like to hand the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. Gene?","Eugene A. Hall","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I'll cover 3 things. I'll begin with an overview of our 2013 full year results. I'll then discuss some of the leading indicators we see for our business and for sales productivity. And I'll share why I'm incredibly optimistic about the year ahead. Then I'll turn the call over to Chris Lafond, who will provide you with additional details about our full year and Q4 financial results for 2013, as well as our guidance for 2014.","Our business performance was strong in 2013. We've had a consistent proven growth strategy for more than 8 years now. And the effective execution of that strategy has resulted in another year of double-digit growth in our key financial metrics. For the full year 2013, contract value was $1.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Revenues were $1.8 million, up 11% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Earnings per share were $1.93, up 12% year-over-year. And normalized EBITDA was $345.4 million, up 10% year-over-year. These results create a strong foundation for us as we move into 2014.","In Research, our largest and most profitable segment, we closed 2013 strong, showing [ph] double-digit contract value growth across every major region and, virtually, every industry and client size. Contract value was up 12% on an FX neutral basis. We ended the year with client and wallet retention rate at 82% and 98%, with wallet retention showing a 1-point improvement over Q3 2013. We are well positioned to accelerate contract value growth in 2014. We're beginning 2014 with a 16% growth in our sales force compared to this time last year, and we will continue to invest in this area.","We have the foundation for strengthening sales productivity this year because of improvements in our ability to recruit talented sales people and improvements in sales training. With these changes, we achieved higher productivity from our 2013 new hires and expect this to continue as they gain experience. Retention of our sales people has improved about 2 points, increasing the number of experienced sales people and, of course, we had a strong Q4. The combination of these factors is why we're optimistic that we can grow our Research business in the 13% to 14% range during 2014. And as contract value growth accelerates, we also expect operating leverage to drive margin expansion.","Let me now turn to our Consulting business. We saw a consistent demand throughout the year for our core Consulting and benchmark services. For the full year of 2013, Consulting revenues grew 4% on an FX neutral basis. The key indicator of future performance, backlog, ended the year at $106 million, representing 10% growth of the third quarter of 2013.","Our Events business delivered yet another record-breaking year with 15% growth in revenues, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Revenues from exhibitors were up 17% on a same-events basis and attendee revenue grew 12% on a same-events basis. As I mentioned, Chris will provide detailed results for our 3 business segments in a moment.","While the selling environment has not improved and nor do we expect it to any time soon, we've improved sales hiring and continued the effective execution of our proven strategy for growth. Our Q4 performance, along with a few leading indicators, makes me incredibly optimistic about the year ahead.","So in summary, I'd like to leave you 3 takeaways from today's call. First, our business performance was strong during Q4 and throughout 2013, providing a great foundation for 2014. Second, our sales headcount growth, along with our ability to attract and retain better or qualified people and bring them to productivity faster, is the best it's ever been. And finally, we expect to accelerate our contract value growth rate by 100 to 200 basis points in 2014 and are well positioned to achieve sustained, double-digit growth in all of our key financial metrics as we've done in the past several years. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher J. Lafond","Thanks, Gene. Good morning, everyone. We ended 2013 with double-digit growth in revenue, earnings and free cash flow, continuing the trend of consistent strong financial performance. We continue to successfully execute on our strategy and deliver on the financial objectives we've established and communicated to you over the past several years. Year-over-year contract value growth remained strong at 12% and retention rates ended at or near all-time highs.","Our Consulting business grew 4% on an FX neutral basis for the full year, and our Events business increased by 15% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis, once again exceeding our long-term expectations for the segment. Demand for our services was robust across all 3 of our business segments in the fourth quarter. Our strong top line performance and effective execution in capitalizing on the operating leverage in our business allowed us to once again expand our gross contribution margin. Even as companies around the world face the uncertainties of the current macroeconomic environment, our business continues to grow at double-digit rates quarter after quarter. This is because our products and services provide great value to the IT supply chain and marketing professionals we work with. We're engaged on our most important initiatives and projects, and this is why we will continue to deliver consistent revenue growth and strong financial performance over the long term.","I'll now provide a review of our 3 business segments for the fourth quarter and full year, and then I'll finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2014. Starting with Research. Research revenue was up 11% on an as-reported basis in the fourth quarter and grew 12% to $1.271 billion for the full year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Research revenues grew 12% for both fourth quarter and full year. Contribution margin in this segment increased 165 basis points to 69% in the fourth quarter and increased 109 basis points to 69.2% for the full year, as we once again capitalized on the operating leverage of this business.","All of our key Research business metrics remained strong in the fourth quarter. Contract value grew to a record level of $1.423 billion, a growth rate of 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and 12% on an FX neutral basis. As has been the case for the past several years, our growth in contract value in Q4 was extremely broad-based with almost every region, industry segment and client size growing at double-digit rates.","New business, again, increased year-over-year. The new business mix remains balanced between sales to new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. While our contract value growth continues to benefit from our discipline of annual price increases and no discounting, approximately 80% of our contract value growth came from volume with the balance from price increases. We've consistently increased our prices by 3% to 6% per year on an annual basis since 2005. We recently implemented a price increase during the fourth quarter of 2013 and we expect to do so again this year.","Our volume growth reflects our success in continuing to grow the business by penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing clients. And as a result, we ended the quarter with 14,099 client organizations, up 6% over last year's fourth quarter. Our client retention rate ended the quarter at 82% and we've maintained client retention rates between 82% and 83% for 14 straight quarters. In addition to retaining our Research clients at an impressive rate, the clients we retain continue to increase their spending with Gartner and wallet retention ended at 98% in the fourth quarter. Wallet retention is higher than client retention due to a combination of increased spending by retained clients and the fact that we retained a higher percentage of our larger clients.","As we've discussed in the past, our retention metrics are reported on a 4-quarter rolling basis in order to eliminate any seasonality. But it's important to note that our wallet retention increased 1 point from the third quarter. And on a stand-alone-quarter basis, wallet retention increased significantly in Q4 to over 100% when compared with Q3.","Despite these few challenging areas, our Research business remains strong with double-digit contract value growth in almost every region, client size and industry during Q4. In fact, excluding the U.S. Federal Government business, the rest of the Americas contract value grew by 15% year-over-year. Similarly, excluding the few same problem areas we outlined last quarter, global contract value grew by 14% in 2013. With our continued strong performance in almost every part of the Research business, we're confident that we will see acceleration in our overall growth rate of contract value as these pockets recover. Assuming these areas don't weaken further, we believe we can accelerate our contract value growth rate to between 13% and 14% in 2014.","In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in our Research business. We grew our contract value by $153 million on an FX neutral basis year-over-year. We continue to see strong demand from clients, and we continue to expect acceleration and contract value and revenue growth over the long term. We remain confident in our continued ability to deliver double-digit annual revenue growth in this business over the long term.","Turning now to Events. Our Events segment continued to trend with extremely strong year-over-year revenue growth we've delivered for the past 4 years. In the fourth quarter, Events revenue increased 10% year-over-year on a both reported and FX neutral basis. During the fourth quarter, we held 11 Events with 20,786 attendees, compared to 14 Events with 22,548 attendees in the fourth quarter of 2012.","On a same-events basis, Events revenue was up 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2013, Events revenue increased 14% on an as-reported basis and 15% on an FX neutral basis as we held 64 Events, 3 more than 2013 -- excuse me, 3 more than 2012.","Attendee revenue increased 11% and exhibitor revenue increased 17% for the full year. The gross contribution margin of 53% for Q4 increased roughly 2 percentage points from the fourth quarter a year ago and our full year contribution margin of 46% was unchanged from the prior year. Our Events business remains well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2014.","Moving on to Consulting. Revenues in Consulting increased 4% on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and increased 5% on an FX neutral basis. For the full year, Consulting results were in line with our long-term targets and our guidance for the year. Revenue growth for the full year in Consulting was 3% on an as-reported basis and 4% on an FX neutral basis. Our strategy continues to be to focus our Consulting services on a select group of our largest clients who request our differentiated benchmarking, Contract Optimization and other strategic services.","Billable headcount of 509 was up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Fourth quarter utilization was 65%, and revenue per billable headcount ended the quarter at $430,000.","Let me spend a moment on Contract Optimization. We've told you in the past this part of our Consulting segment can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And Contract Optimization represents about 10% of our Consulting segment. We expect Contract Optimization revenue to range from approximately $30 million to $40 million annually. It ended 2013 at the high end of that range after it made the low end in 2012. We're seeing steady demand for our Consulting services. Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for Consulting, ended the quarter at $106 million. This represents 10% growth over the prior quarter and a healthy 4 months of backlog, which is our target for this business. With the current backlog and visibility we have into the pipeline, the Consulting business is positioned to deliver solid results in the coming year.","Moving down the income statement, SG&A increased by $27 million year-over-year during the fourth quarter primarily driven by growth in our sales force. For the full year, SG&A increased 12%, again reflecting an acceleration of our sales investment from the prior year. As of December 31, we had 1,643 quota-bearing sales associates, an increase of 226 sales associates from a year ago. We continue to tightly control G&A costs across the entire company. We believe this expense item will provide us with a source of operating leverage in the future as G&A continues to decline as a percent of revenue.","Moving on to earnings. We delivered another quarter of solid earnings growth. Normalized EBITDA was $106 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65, up 7% year-over-year. As expected, our Q4 2013 GAAP diluted earnings per share included $0.01 in amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions, including Ideas International.","For the full year 2013, normalized EBITDA grew 10% to $354.4 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.93, up 12% year-over-year. Our full year 2013 GAAP diluted earnings per share included $0.04 in amortization and other costs associated with our acquisitions, including Ideas International. I would note that our EPS growth rates were impacted by unusually low tax rates in 2012. For the fourth quarter, our tax rate was 29% in 2013 versus 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2012. And in the full year, our tax rate was 31.4% in 2013 versus 29.6% in 2012.","Turning to cash. Full year operating cash flow increased by 13% to $316 million from the same period in 2012. Free cash flow for the year was $280 million, an increase of 18% and in line with our guidance for 2013. We continue to deliver free cash flow of approximately 1.5x net income. Over the long term, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow at this level despite our tight cash management and the negative working capital characteristics of our Research business.","During the fourth quarter, we utilized our cash to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. For the full year, we repurchased over 3.4 million shares at a total cost of approximately $197 million. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and cash position with net cash of $219 million. Our credit facility runs through March of 2018 and, at this time, provides us with about $550 million of remaining borrowing capacity. We have ample cash flow and liquidity to continue to grow our business and execute initiatives that drive increased shareholder value. We continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities as a potential use of cash. We also believe that repurchasing our shares remains a compelling use of our capital.","Today, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new $800 million share repurchase authorization, which replaces our previous $500 million program that had been largely exhausted. With this new larger authorization, our intention is to accelerate our share repurchase activity going forward. Absent other significant opportunities to deploy cash, we expect to utilize the bulk of this new authorization over the next 2 years, which would effectively double the pace of our 2013 repurchase activity.","We believe we'll accomplish this more accelerated share repurchase activity while also maintaining capital for attractive M&A opportunities, given our high cash flow profile. One of our financial priorities is to take advantage of our cash flow and liquidity to optimize our capital structure and this accelerated share repurchase strategy is a step towards achieving that goal.","Now let me turn to our business outlook for 2014. Based on the solid business trends we experienced in 2013, we believe our businesses are well positioned for another year of strong growth. Our guidance for 2014 is based on the following assumptions: the current macroeconomic environment continues through the year; our sales productivity remains flat or improves marginally from 2013 levels; our sales force grows approximately 15%; and with regard to foreign exchange, our guidance is based on the spot rates in early January. We've made no attempts in our guidance to anticipate any strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar from the actual foreign exchange rates in early January. For the full year 2014, we expect total revenues will grow by 9% to 11% to approximately $1.94 billion to $1.985 billion on an as-reported basis. We expect our results to have a marginal negative impact from foreign exchange during 2014, given where rates currently stand. And as a result, we expect revenues to grow marginally faster in each of our business units on an FX neutral basis in 2014, as compared to the as-reported number. The impact is expected to be approximately 50 basis points, given the rates today.","Projected revenues by segment on an as-reported basis can be found in our press release. On an FX neutral basis, Research revenue is expected to be up 12% to 13%; Consulting revenue up 1% to 5%; and Events revenue up 8% to 13%. At this point, we plan to hold 62 to 64 events in 2014 as compared to 64 in 2013.","Moving down the income statement, we expect normalized EBITDA for the full year 2014 to be between $375 million and $400 million, an increase of 10% to 17% over 2013 on an FX neutral basis. Given what we know today, we see the midpoint of that EBITDA range as the most likely outcome for the year. In 2014, we expect the costs associated with stock-based compensation plans to be approximately $37 million to $39 million. Total depreciation and amortization should be between $35 million and $37 million, inclusive of the amortization of acquisition intangible assets. We expect interest expense of approximately $9 million and other expense of $1 million to $2 million. We're projecting an annual effective tax rate of approximately 32.5% and our guidance is based on an average fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 93 million shares for the year.","Note that our tax rate may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to timing of certain items. Our GAAP earnings guidance for 2014 is for EPS to be between $2.12 and $2.30 per share. Similar to what I said with respect to EBITDA, given what we know today, we expect to be towards the middle of that EPS range. We also expect to grow our cash flow as we drive growth in our Research business. In 2014, we expect cash from operations of $336 million to $358 million, capital expenditures of $36 million to $38 million, and free cash flow of $300 million to $320 million. Thus, we expect to generate free cash flow per share of $3.23 to $3.45 in 2014. As in prior year, our cash -- our free cash flow should again approximate 150% of our net earnings levels in 2014.","Now I'd like to provide some additional information to allow for an understanding of the seasonality and other factors that will impact our revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis. In 2014, our EPS phasing by quarter will reflect an even more pronounced seasonality than our reported results from 2013. The first quarter will, again, be the seasonally lightest quarter of the year. In 2014, we're planning to shift 4 Events and roughly $10 million of revenue out of Q1 into Q2. As a result, we expect GAAP EPS to be between $0.35 and $0.37 in the first quarter. Also reflecting that shift, Q2 Events revenue and earnings will be a bit heavier than in previous years. I'd also like to remind you that our third quarter results are a seasonally light quarter, again, due to our Events calendar on our Consulting business.","As in years past, the fourth quarters are seasonally heaviest with more than 50% of the full year Events revenue in that quarter because our fall symposium series is held in Q4.","Finally, I'd like to spend a moment on the impact of foreign exchange changes as it relates to our reported contract value. As we've communicated to you in the past, Research contract value is reported on an FX neutral basis throughout each year. We do this so you can understand the true organic growth in our Research segment. In January of each year, we restate opening contract value at current foreign exchange rates. As a result of changes in FX rates since January 2013, contract value at January 1, 2014, is approximately $21 million lower than the $1.423 billion reported on December 31. As a result, $1.402 billion is the baseline figure you should use for comparison purposes when judging contract value growth in 2014 on an FX neutral basis.","So to summarize, we delivered solid results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2013. Demand for our services is strong and, as a result, we generated double-digit revenue growth and our key business metrics remained strong throughout 2013. Our initiatives to improve operational effectiveness, coupled with positive operating leverage inherent in our businesses, delivered solid earnings and cash flow growth for the full year. As always, we're actively exploring strategic alternatives for deploying our cash. We'll continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase program going forward.","Finally, with double-digit growth in contract value in 2013, we established a solid foundation for delivering another year of revenue and earnings growth in 2014. We're well positioned for double-digit revenue and earnings growth and increasing returns to our shareholders over the long term. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Timothy McHugh of William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, I guess, Gene, just your comment about -- I guess, looking at the numbers, you expect sales productivity to be relatively flat. But just at a high level, you're talking about 15% sales force growth, you were just at 16%. So when you say 13% to 14% sales -- or contract value growth, I guess, what's the difference there? And is that roughly flat in your view? Or it still seems like it would be down a little bit.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, a great question. So basically, just to kind of recap, our sales force headcount growth year-over-year, we ended with 16% more people at the end of 2013 than we did at the end of 2012. And so that's an acceleration from what we had experienced the previous year as well. So with that -- what drives our contract value growth is the number of sales people you have and in the productivity of those sales people. And so if we look at it, we have the number of sales people up, there's a richer mix of newer sales people because we accelerated the number of new people, who on average sell a little less than tenured, experienced sales people. And you put all the mix, we look at the growth [indiscernible] productivity we're expecting and we're expecting something like 13% to 14% contract value growth, driven by, again, the combination of a 16% headcount growth with the growth in -- with the relatively flat sales productivity.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So when you're saying flat sales productivity, you're looking at the mixture of the sales people and basically given a certain tenure of the sales person, it would be flat with what you would expect, kind of?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes. So basically, we're -- again, just to sort of summarize, we're expecting roughly flat sales productivity year-over-year. So we're not assuming any big improvement. And we're working on improvements and we're optimistic on that, as I talked about, but we've got to assume that when we talk about 13% to 14%. The 13% to 14% contract value growth is not predicated on a big improvement of sales productivity.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right. I guess, just -- and then an update in terms of -- I think it was about 1 year, 1.5 years ago, you kind of rejiggered the approach to adding the sales people. What's your view on how that's taking hold, I guess? And then maybe somewhat different question, a broader one, is, there's a number of questions, I think, I continue to get and others continue to get just on sales force productivity and it's kind of trended down a little bit over the last couple of years. And so can you talk a little bit about your view on whether or not it's becoming harder to get each dollar of sale or if this is truly just a timing thing and you feel confident long term that it's unchanged?","Eugene A. Hall","So, in general, it's not getting harder to get each dollar of sale. Last year, we had -- Chris talked about this in his remarks. If you look at last year, our -- if you take out a small set of problem areas, actually, our growth -- our CV growth rate accelerated. And when you [indiscernible] total average, you include those problem areas, it makes sense, but then under the covers what's going on is, we had some things that were relatively -- and we haven't experienced those every year. It kind of happened last year. And even with that, we had roughly flat sales productivity. So if you exclude those areas, our productivity actually improved since because of the things you're talking about, so improved recruiting, improved training, our focus on retaining sales people so that we have a richer mix of tenured sales people. And so that's kind of what's driving our overall sales productivity.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just, Chris, can I ask one question on the repurchases? You used the phrase \"accelerated pace.\" Is that an accelerated case, meaning, you're going to buy back more? Or are you talking about truly an accelerated share repurchase plan, a more formal set of plans?","Christopher J. Lafond","No, we're not looking at an accelerated buyback. What we're looking at is increasing, so how quickly or how much we're spending on share repurchase. So if you look last year, 2013, we spent approximately $200 million. Our new authorization is $800 million. As I said in my remarks, we expect to spend that $800 million. Barring any other significant uses of cash that come up, we would expect to spend that over the next 2 years. So that's almost double the pace of activity. Our approach will be to continue to buy in the open market on a quarterly basis and you should expect us to be in the market doing that quite regularly.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mazari, Hamzah of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up question on sales force productivity. Could you give us a sense of how far behind Europe is in sales force productivity versus the U.S.? Is it 1 year, is it a 1.5 years? And maybe just update us on some of the operational issues last quarter, whether those are -- what the update there is?","Eugene A. Hall","So if you -- it's Gene. So if you look at Europe, there's not kind of one answer, meaning that there are some countries that are among the best in the world of sales productivity in Europe, and there are some areas that are not as good as that. And you can't look at Europe and truly say, \"What's their total productivity?\" We look at it by each of the selling teams and they're often oriented [ph] along with the countries. So some are really good and some are not quite so good. In the areas that -- at any given point in time we're in Gartner, we have sales teams around the world that some are doing better, some are doing a little worse. The ones that are having issues, we know what to do to fix them so we go in and we work on it, and we get those teams to have better productivity. And that's what we see in terms of Europe as well.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Very helpful. And last question on -- when you look at net new business and existing business contributing 50% each to revenue growth, does that mix change long-term as your sales force becomes more tenured? Or does that sort of stay consistent? How should one think about going out and getting more new business?","Eugene A. Hall","So as we've talked about, we have loads of opportunity in every place we go. And so for -- I don't -- today, we get contributions from new clients. We get clients new to Gartner from clients that are -- but existing clients, we sell more to, and there's huge opportunities on both those dimensions and while the mix change is a little bit quarter-to-quarter or whatever, for many years to come, we'd see growth in both of those categories being sort of comparable. So no change.","Christopher J. Lafond","And what I would add to that -- it's Chris. Just the facts on the existing clients, just the average Research client today spends approximately $100,000 with Gartner. So that's only 3 or 4 seats. So in terms of being able to continue to penetrate existing clients, there's still plenty of opportunity. The vast majority of our clients are buying between 1 and 5 seats. So still plenty of opportunity to penetrate existing. As Gene said, still plenty of opportunity as we talk about all the time in terms of companies we're not working with today. For many years running, we've had a pretty consistent balance of around half of our new business coming from new clients and half from existing, and we see no reason that will change.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jerry Herman of Stifel.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Chris, I wanted to ask you about the SG&A commentary again, given the move in that line item. You mentioned sales force activity, but it still seems to be bloated and I'm wondering if you can add some additional color there. And if there were any other year-end adjustments that impacted that line item?","Christopher J. Lafond","Thanks, Jerry. No, it really is when you look at SG&A, SG&A is about 2\/3 sales and marketing, and 1\/3 G&A. The G&A piece continues to come down as a percent of revenue. So no change in that trend. We're continuing to manage expenses very tightly there. So the G&A line has continued to do exactly what we have been doing and expect it to do. On the sales side, as we talked about, we had accelerated our sales hiring at 16%. That was only growing 12% last year. We actually added them throughout the year at -- earlier in the year, so you're seeing more of the impact. So if you look back at 2012, more people came towards the back end. This year, they came in more evenly, so you had the combination of accelerating growth and the timing of hires impacting that, which is why the S part of SG&A has gone up at the level it has. We, as we just talked about, feel very comfortable with what we're seeing in many parts of the world around sales productivity and that's where we're making our sales investments. So we feel like we're putting people in the right places that are going to have the biggest impact. And -- but given where sales productivity is, and that it's been flat to slightly down, that is, it's put a little pressure on the S part of the SG&A line as a percent of revenue.","Jerry R. Herman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then -- and the second question really relates to sort of the general operating leverage in the business overall. And your previous commentary about margin progression, I think you guys have talked about 50 to 150 basis points. As I look at last year, it looks like you were actually below that. And then I looked at your guidance for this year at least on an EBITDA margin basis, it looks like relatively minor movement in the EBITDA margin. I think it can come up with about 30 basis points year-over-year. Is there anything else that's going on either timing or structurally that's dampening that leverage?","Eugene A. Hall","We still expect -- no, we still expect that range, 50 to 150 basis points. Just a couple of things that we commented on last quarter and continue to comment on is, if you look at where the leverage has come from in the past, we have done a great job on the gross margin line. So the Research business, as an example, has moved from below 60% to close to our target of 70%. So you're getting very close to where we think that's the max for that segment. So in terms of getting more leverage out of improving the margin there, you get less there. So we think that the way we get 50 to 150 is shifting from getting it more on the gross margin line to getting more of it from continued expansion of sales productivity on the sales line. So we absolutely believe that. And I think if you look at our guidance range next year from high end to low end, we're in the middle of that 50 to 150 range, roughly at the high end. And so we certainly expect as we see and expect sales productivity to improve over time with the things we're doing that we will continue to see expansion of our operating margins and EBITDA margins as a result of that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Capital Markets.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wonder if we could just review what the problem areas are and just get a sense of what their impact is to the numbers in '13.","Christopher J. Lafond","It's Chris. What we talked about last time was, obviously, one big area was U.S. Fed. And what we talked about is that in the Americas, if you take out the U.S. Fed business, that business is growing 15-ish-percent. And so that has a pretty significant impact because of the challenges there. Just in terms of do we expect that to change? That's been a great market for us. It will continue in the future to be a great market for us. We still have a great amount of business with the U.S. Federal Government. They happen to be in a period of change and turmoil right now. We don't expect that to change significantly in 2014. So our expectations are that will continue to be a tough selling environment, and we don't expect to get any improvement there. But other than that, in the Americas, we're having fantastic growth and acceleration in contract value growth from where we were, if you exclude that. We also talked about some governments around Europe. Similarly, if you take that out, Europe has actually accelerated as well and is approaching overall in Europe 14% growth, if you take that out. So similar kind of thing. We're not expecting those environments to change. Governments around the world, we expect still to be under pressure and be tough selling environments. And when those governments with the national levels around the world change, we feel like we have an opportunity for that to really help us drive even further acceleration in contract value growth. And we did talk about some other problem areas. As always, there's a problem here, there, around the world. Nothing's ever perfect. And those are more internal than external, and we feel like we're addressing those and feel very comfortable as we move into 2014 that any issues we have internally have been dealt with and addressed.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for the commentary around contract value acceleration. So based on that, based on what you just said, we're not expecting any change in U.S. Fed or some of the government business in Europe. So is the contract value acceleration based solely on sales force productivity or is there any change in the demand environment that's also being included in that?","Eugene A. Hall","It's Gene. It's really based on the fact that we come into the year with 16% headcount growth. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the productivity of those people we hired last year actually is higher in their first period of time. And so if you look at the trend, we expect that we have more people and those newer people are going to have higher productivity than our newer people have had in the past, on average. And so the combination of those 2 things.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it's productivity. Has there been any -- and the last question from me, I guess, just finishing up on the demand environment. Has there been any change, any uptick or change in the demand environment? Or do you -- is your expectation for next year for that to be flat with no real change in any of these problem areas?","Eugene A. Hall","So we're assuming the selling environment will remain the same in 2014 as it did in 2013. No improvement in the selling environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Meuler of Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, just first, a lot of the metrics you guys give us are trailing 12 metrics and I just want to make sure that I'm interpreting what you're saying correctly, Gene. If you look at on a quarterly basis, not a trailing 12 basis, have you already seen kind of the positive inflection, the acceleration, in terms of whether you look at new business sold, wallet retention, client retention, et cetera?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, that's a great question. So if you look at Q4 by itself, most of the metrics improved. So sales productivity actually improved in Q4, if you look at it by itself. If you look at the retention metrics, they actually improved, if you look at just Q4 by itself. So Q4, we actually saw an inflection point in Q4, and it's driven by the factors that I just talked -- that I talked about earlier, which is that we have more people. Those new people have higher productivity. We have lower sales [indiscernible]. All that stuff is driving this inflection point where all the kind of underlying leading indicators kind of had a nice uptick in Q4.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then I think you got a couple of questions on this. I'm still not quite clear on the answer, but in terms of the delta between the headcount growth being 16%, currently 15% you're expecting for the year and what you're guiding to for Research contract value growth '13 to '14, in '14, when you're saying that productivity is going to be flat to up, are you saying productivity for the year 1s is going to be flat to up? For the year 2s, they're going to be flat to up? For the year 3s, they're going to be flat to up? Or are you saying that across the whole base, it's going to be flat to up?","Eugene A. Hall","So let me just start by what we're talking when we say sales productivity. We're talking about the net contract value growth versus what we actually pay for people or versus the number of people. So if you look at the net contract value growth per person, we're expecting that to be flat to up for next year. And as we mentioned before, we actually saw they go up a little bit in Q4. So the contract value growth per person, as opposed to total contract value per person.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it, perfect. And then just finally, Chris, on the buyback, I just want to make sure that I'm -- if I heard you right, I think you said something, a share count that's pretty similar to where you probably exited the year in terms of what's baked into the guidance. So it sounds like maybe you built a little bit of the share count into the guidance, but way less than the 400 that you're expecting to spend, is that correct?","Christopher J. Lafond","No, I don't think so. I think we -- our expectation is that, as I said, for the $800 million program, we're going to be fairly aggressive and accelerate beyond what we've been doing, almost at twice the pace. And obviously, that comes in throughout the whole year so it doesn't all happen early. So you need to kind of feather that in. Based on that, we would expect to be in the market relatively evenly. And as a result, we would expect it to be in the range of shares that I gave you. It could have come in a little lower, maybe, depending on how quickly we buy shares back. But I would say that's a reasonable place to be based on all the modeling we've done.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","You did say 93 million shares for the full year and the Q4 average share count was 93.9 million and you were buying during Q4. So I'm assuming the exit share count is lower than the 93.9 million. Are all of those numbers correct?","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, you got them right.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray.","John D. Crowther - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, you've got John Crowther on for Peter. Just following up on that last question on productivity, and I apologize if you may have mentioned this earlier. But sort of wondering what your pace of sales earning is going to be in '14. As you talked about '13 was a little bit more front-end-loaded. And then kind of following up on that on the productivity sector comments, you said the productivity in Q4 was actually up year-over-year. So just wondering, again, is there going to be a little bit of seasonality to productivity driven by the pace of sales force hiring?","Eugene A. Hall","So the first question, our long-term goal is to hire 15% to 20% per year in terms of adding to the sales force and we expect to be in that range for 2014. In terms of the variability, so if you look at the net contract value growth per person in a stand-alone quarter, we saw more net contract value growth. It varies by quarter. So if you calculate that way, of course, it will change like where there's some seasonality, which is why we look at a rolling 12 -- rolling 4 quarters to kind of normalize it there.","John D. Crowther - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. I guess, I'm just trying to understand, maybe give a little bit of a reminder here of the sort of pacing of productivity of new hires, especially given a little bit of the commentary earlier about efforts to improve that productivity of those people.","Eugene A. Hall","So we have been shifting hiring to earlier in the year. As Chris mentioned earlier, in 2013, we hired throughout the year much earlier than we did in 2012. And then in 2014, we're also planning to be a little more front-loaded than to hire evenly throughout the year in terms of the sales force growth. The guys we hired last year -- once you hire somebody, then they go to training and then they get in territory and it takes a little while before they make -- before they could prep for a sale. And so as you can imagine, as you hire new salespeople, they get more productive over time. And so their first full year, they have one level of productivity. Second full year, it's substantially better. And third full year, it's still even better than that. And so the people that we hired in 2013, suppose that was more front-loaded in the year, we come into 2014 with both more people and also those new hires that we had have had a little more tenure than the ones that we came into 2013 with, all of which is why we're kind of optimistic on our results for 2014 -- contract value growth for 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I was just wondering with the accelerated buybacks if you could give some color on what that means for other capital allocation options, whether it's the M&A environment or a potential [indiscernible] in the future.","Eugene A. Hall","So a couple of things. First of all, we are in a great position from a cash perspective. We have over $400 million of cash. We have over $500 million of liquidity in our credit facility. So we have -- and we generate well in excess of $300 million a year in cash every year. So we have more than ample ability to accelerate our share repurchases from where we've been and give us the continued flexibility for acquisition. So we are not limiting our ability to do acquisitions. We still think there are plenty of opportunities and continue to look aggressively there. Because our balance sheet is strong, because our cash flow profile's improved, we're taking the opportunity to accelerate and still give us the same flexibility. As we've talked about many times, the 2 things that we think are the best use of cash are share repurchases and acquisitions. But over time, we will continue to look for other opportunities and we are open to other things as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and drive further cash flow. But at this point, those are the 2 things that we feel are the most attractive from a shareholder value perspective.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Events business, maybe a little bit on whether you're seeing anything from corporate restrictions on travel and how that may be affecting that business.","Eugene A. Hall","Is that -- you're talking Events?","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","Eugene A. Hall","From an Events perspective, as you've seen over the last couple of years, we've continued to see great attendance growth at all of our events globally. Despite the economic environments, all of our events everywhere in the world, our fourth quarter events, almost every event was up year-over-year in attendance. So we've not seen any impact significantly. The one place we did see some impact was in the Federal Government business where some of those travel restrictions did impact some attendance, but overall, I would say it's not a significant issue for what we've seen in our performance in 2013.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital.","Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary. Just in terms of the recent productivity improvement, especially amongst some of the more recent hires, I was wondering if there is a reason why you've been a little bit conservative on the pace of sales hiring, particularly at the lower end of your long-term range.","Eugene A. Hall","Yes, so as we mentioned, last year, we hired at 16%, which is well within the 15% to 20%, and we're planning this year to be in that same range. So we're kind of in the range of what we have aspired to be in.","Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I just didn't know that the more recent improvements of productivity among those kind of shifted any further pace of hiring. But I guess, just in terms of the recent challenges you guys had in France, any kind of update on that?","Eugene A. Hall","The -- we're in some -- more than 90 countries around the world. At any given point in time, we're going to have an operational issue in 1 or 2 of them. And the -- but it's operational things that we know what to do about. It's not something -- if I compare it to the national government issues, that was more an internal operations thing and we have that at any given point in time somewhere. We know what to do to fix it, and so we're not concerned about that.","Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just in terms of the use of cash and particularly with the acquisitions on the horizon there, has it been more of like a lack of attractive assets, lack of sellers or kind of a pricing issue for you guys?","Eugene A. Hall","As you know, a couple of things. Number one, we're pretty thoughtful on acquisitions. We can continue to do and deliver the kind of results we have with -- organically. So we do not need to acquire companies to deliver the results. So we're very thoughtful on acquisition. We're very thoughtful about spending shareholder money on acquisitions at the right price. So for us, there's no lack of attractive candidates. It all comes down to the appropriate valuation. And obviously, many things in our space are privately held and when they are available for sale by the owners and we're always looking and continue to do that and we see no change in the marketplace for opportunities.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm not going to ask about the sales force productivity. Actually, just you were talking about your global exposure. I know there's been a lot of concern about emerging markets' exposure. I don't know exactly how you guys define emerging markets, but maybe you can give us a little bit more color about what you're doing in some of those areas.","Eugene A. Hall","Sure. I think when you look overall at our business, emerging markets are a relatively small piece today. We -- as we've talked about in the past, a few places, India, China, Brazil, some of those places have done extremely well for us and are still growing at or above the average for our business. So we've -- and by the way, yes, there's been a deceleration. Brazil has decelerated from extremely high pace, but it's still running at a pace that's above our average contract value growth rate. So we feel very good about the places we are operating in from an emerging markets point of view. And we continue to see really nice, healthy growth out of those areas. And I don't view them today as a drag against our overall growth rates.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right, that's great to hear. And just a question about the guidance. In trying to get to your normalized EBITDA numbers, what kind of gross margin should we be modeling? And if we can get color by the different divisions, that would be great.","Eugene A. Hall","So if you look at the 3 segments, Research is approaching what we think is our long-term target of 70%. And our Consulting business, over time, should move to 40% and we're kind of sitting at 36-ish percent now. So there's a little bit more room for that to expand. It's not going to do that overnight, but we would expect that to move this year a little bit closer towards that 36 number. Events, we think, is about a 50% number overall, depending on the number of launches and where we launch those. But we would fully expect that to start to -- or continue to move in that direction. And you saw a little bit of that movement in Q4. So you should think 70%, 40%, 50% as the long term for those 3 segments, Research, Consulting and Events. We're approaching that in Research, a little more room in both of the other segments.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Brian Shipman for closing remarks.","Brian Shipman","Thank you, everyone, for being with us today on the Q4 2013 earnings call. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us. And we look forward to seeing you next week in New York at Investor Day. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you."],"10277":["Gartner, Inc.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to Gartner's GVP of Investor Relations, David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.","David Cohen - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Gartner's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer. This call will include a discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and our outlook for 2018 as disclosed in today's press release.","Following comments by Gene and Craig, we will open up the call for your questions. In addition to today's press release, we have provided an accompanying presentation as a reference for investors and analysts, which we will reference during our prepared remarks. Both the press release and the presentation are available on our website, investor.gartner.com.","On the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to revenue and contribution margin are for adjusted revenue and adjusted contribution margin, which exclude the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment. All references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website.","As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Welcome to our quarterly earnings call. Thanks for joining us. 2017 was a great year for Gartner. We had strong operating results. We closed and largely integrated CEB, we acquired L2, and we took steps to support future growth. I continue to be excited about our business, our prospects for growth, and our strategy to create value for our shareholders over the long-term.","I'll begin with an update on the CEB acquisition which has gone extraordinarily well. We announced our acquisition of CEB in January 2017. There's uncertainty as to the time required for due diligence, arranging financing and the required regulatory approvals. Based on typical timelines, we laid out a plan for closing the acquisition.","We satisfied all the requirements and closed the CEB acquisition in early April, much faster than typical for this size deal. There's also uncertainty as to how fast we could proceed with integrating CEB into Gartner. For due diligence, we determined that we would be able to pursue an extremely aggressive timeline for integrating CEB and preparing for accelerated growth. Once the acquisition closed, we pursued this aggressive integration.","As of today, we have fully integrated the two organizations. This is no simple task as it involved integrating about 5,000 heritage CEB associates with about 10,000 heritage Gartner associates. The two research organizations have been integrated. The product teams are integrated. The heritage CEB destination events and Evanta businesses have been integrated into the heritage Gartner Events business and the staff functions such as HR, finance and IT have been integrated.","We have met our expectations on capturing synergies. We determined the Talent Assessment did not fit strategically, set it up as a standalone business, and have reached an agreement to sell the business. We've also accelerated the investments needed to drive future growth in the heritage CEB research and advisory business. We developed a new set of products. We introduced improved commercial terms, restricting customer service, improving retention. For the first time in recent CEB history, we accelerated hiring. As of today, we've grown our heritage CEB sales territories by approximately 18% year-over-year. We expanded our sales support positions by more than 20%.","All these actions were in a much faster timeline than we anticipated when we announced the transaction. And they're already having an impact. Heritage CEB contract value grew 2% in 2017, significantly faster than in recent years. And wallet retention improved by 6 percentage points, a remarkable improvement in a single year.","We acquired CEB for the strategic value of being able to address all functions across the enterprise and best of both operational approaches. The rapid closing, aggressive integration timeline, and accelerated growth investments, together with our initial operating results, give us a high degree of confidence that we are well on the way to achieving our strategic objectives and delivering consistent double-digit growth over the long-term. In short, the CEB acquisition is proceeding ahead of our initial expectations.","While we're making great progress on CEB, the heritage Gartner Research business had its best year ever. Contract value growth accelerated to 16%. Once again, we had double-digit growth in every region across every size company and in virtually every industry. Wallet retention was 106%, up 1 percentage point year-over-year; and client retention was 84%, also up 1 percentage point year-over-year. These are near our all-time highs.","We ended the year with almost 12,000 enterprises as clients, up 7% year-over-year. Our sales force continues to be a critical investment. At the end of Q4, the heritage Gartner sales force grew 16% year-over-year. We identified and hired a large number of highly qualified sales people, allowing us to reduce our number of open sales territories to near record low levels. And this provides a great foundation for future growth.","Growing sales productivity remains a top priority for us. Over the past few years, we've implemented a number of programs to improve sales productivity. Those actions are working. We drove another consecutive quarter of sales productivity improvement. Sales productivity for Q4 2017 improved 15% organically over the same quarter last year. And looking forward, our sales pipeline is strong.","Gartner Events allows our clients to interact in person with our analyst and their peers. Revenues for the heritage Gartner Events business grew 10% during 2017. Our attendees grew 17% and we hosted more than 10,000 CIOs for the first time. Not everything went perfectly. We continue to have higher level of open territories in our exhibitor sales force which impacted our revenues from exhibitors. We believe these are now addressed and our forward bookings for 2018 are up at double-digit rates.","Gartner Consulting extends the value of our research, providing in-depth expertise on longer-term engagements. Our Consulting business grew 3% during 2017 which is below our expectations. We experienced a higher than usual turnover at Managing Partners in selected regions which impacted our bookings and revenues. Our Contract Optimization business had a solid year overall, but underperformed our expectations in Q4.","Looking forward, we ended the year with a backlog of 9%, position us well for 2018. As we discussed in the past, the Talent Assessment business does not fit strategically with the rest of Gartner. As a result, we announced today that we've reached an agreement to sell our Talent Assessment business. While not a strategic fit with Gartner, Talent Assessment is a leader in an attractive market and this change will ensure a bright future for this business.","During 2017, Talent Assessment underperformed our expectations. This was primarily due to an unusually large number of open sales territories from when the business was acquired. We largely filled those territories. With a full sales complement and exciting new products, we believe the business is well-positioned for the future. So summarizing, the heritage Gartner Research business had its best year ever with accelerated contract value growth, higher retention and improved sales productivity.","Heritage Gartner Events had strong attendance, exhibitor sales that were below our expectations and a strong forward exhibitor bookings. Consulting, 2017 revenues were below our expectations but ended with a strong backlog.","We acquired CEB for the strong strategic benefits of extending our market to all functions across the enterprise and to enable best of both operational approaches. The rapid closing, aggressive integration timeline and accelerated growth investments, together with our initial operating results, give us a high degree of confidence that we are well on the way to achieving our strategic objectives and delivering consistent double-digit growth over the long-term.","I'll now hand the call over to Craig Safian, our Chief Financial Officer.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was an exciting year for Gartner. The heritage Gartner business remains an amazing one, driving consistent, double-digit growth, while delivering tremendous value to our clients around the world.","We're addressing our vast market opportunity by building on the compelling client value proposition, focusing on strong operational execution and investing for future growth.","During the year, we acquired CEB and L2, creating a much broader addressable market and giving us the ability to provide even more value to our clients. While we're still early in the transformation of CEB, we have made meaningful progress, which we will discuss today and in more detail at our Investor Day next week.","On an FX neutral basis, our year-over-year financial performance for 2017 included; total company revenue growth of 35%, heritage Gartner Research revenue growth of 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 42%, and diluted adjusted EPS, excluding acquisition adjustments and a non-recurring tax benefit, of $3.31 per share, or 12% growth. On a combined rolling four quarter basis, free cash flow conversion was 112% of adjusted net income.","We continue to see robust demand for our services across the globe. During the fourth quarter, we saw an acceleration in our contract value growth, along with sequential and year-over-year improvements in our retention metrics and sales productivity. And as our 2018 outlook demonstrates, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth with strong cash flow generation.","Fourth quarter combined adjusted revenue was $1.1 billion, up 11%. This reflected 15% growth for the heritage Gartner business and a 1% decline for the acquired CEB business. The deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment in the quarter was $50 million. Also, in the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $221 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.17 per share.","Research had a very strong quarter, accelerating across the board with sequential and year-over-year improvements to contract value growth, retention and sales productivity. On a combined basis, Research adjusted revenue grew 14% in the fourth quarter. The adjusted gross contribution margin for Research was 69%, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016 on a comparable basis.","In the heritage Gartner Research business, adjusted revenues increased by 19% in the fourth quarter. Excluding CEB and L2, which we acquired in March 2017, heritage Gartner Research adjusted revenues grew 15% on an FX neutral basis in Q4.","For the full year 2017, combined Research revenues increased by 12% or 16% excluding the addition of CEB. On a full year basis, the 2017 adjusted gross contribution margin for Research was 69%, consistent when compared to the full year 2016.","Our other metrics for the heritage Gartner Research business all improved in Q4 and remained very strong. Total heritage Gartner contract value was $2.2 billion at the end of 2017, FX neutral growth of 16% versus the prior year, including a one-point benefit from the inclusion of L2. This is an improvement from the strong growth we delivered in the third quarter. For reference, our Q4 2016 total contract value for heritage Gartner at current year FX rates was $1.9 billion.","Total contract value growth for heritage Gartner Research accelerated 110 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. From a heritage Gartner Research perspective, client retention was 84%, up 70 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2016 and 70 basis points on a sequential basis as well. Wallet retention ended at 106% for the quarter, up by 125 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. Both retention figures are at two-year highs and close to our all-time highs.","New business growth for heritage Gartner Research was outstanding in the fourth quarter, up 23% year-on-year, our highest reported growth rate since 2011. The new business mix was consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between new clients, sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients. And, as always, we also benefited from our annual price increases.","Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast addressable market with both new and existing client enterprises. We ended the fourth quarter with 11,904 enterprise clients, up 7% compared to Q4 of 2016. The average spend per enterprise also continues to grow. It now stands at $186,000 per enterprise, up 8% versus the prior year on an FX neutral basis.","This continued and consistent increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth through both new and existing enterprises. Our investments to improve sales force productivity continue to pay off as organic sales force productivity was up again this quarter. For the heritage Gartner sales force, over the last rolling four quarters, we delivered $281 million of organic FX net contract value increase or NCVI. This excludes the impact of the L2 acquisition.","When divided by our beginning period head count, which was 2,423 quota-bearing heads, our rolling four quarter organic productivity per account executive was $116,000. Excluding the impact of the L2 acquisition, sales productivity was up 15% year-on-year and up 10% sequentially. As always, we are focused on continuous improvements in recruiting, training and tools to support higher sales productivity, a key driver of our short and long-term results.","CEB Research adjusted revenues were down 1% year-on-year in Q4, roughly consistent with the performance since the acquisition. We saw many positives with CEB's other research metrics in the quarter. We ended Q4 with $557 million of heritage CEB Research contract value, up 1.5% (sic) [2%] on a year-over-year basis. In addition, wallet retention ended the quarter at 96%, up 300 basis points compared to the third quarter. The non-technology areas at CEB accelerated to 3% year-over-year CV growth. This is a notable contrast to the historical trend in 2015 and 2016 at CEB prior to our acquisition of the business.","To summarize our Research performance for the quarter, heritage Gartner organic contract value growth accelerated to 15% in the fourth quarter, spurred by new business, sequential improvements to productivity and both client and wallet retention. And heritage CEB contract value growth also improved to 1.5%, fueled by improvements to wallet retention.","In Events, combined adjusted revenues increased by 5% year-on-year in Q4. Events fourth quarter gross contribution margin was 51%, down by approximately 300 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. Revenues and margins in the fourth quarter were impacted by softness in exhibitor revenues related to open territories, as Gene mentioned. We've entered 2018 with a significant improvement in our advanced bookings and a significant reduction in our open territories.","CEB Events revenue declined 5% year-over-year. Q4 heritage Gartner Events revenue grew 7% year-on-year, driven by an 8% increase in same event revenues, partially offset by softer performance in exhibitor revenue. We continue to see solid performance in attendees, reporting a 12% increase in same event attendees. FX had a roughly 2 point benefit to our heritage Gartner Events reported revenues in the fourth quarter. On a full year combined basis, Events adjusted revenue increased by 10% in 2017 and its adjusted gross margin contribution of 49% was down 330 basis points compared to 2016.","Fourth quarter Consulting revenues increased by 5% on a reported basis and increased 3% on an FX neutral basis. In the labor-based business, revenues increased 12% versus Q4 of last year, while the Contract Optimization business was down 21%. On the labor-based side, billable head count of 682 was up 8%; and we had 137 Managing Partners at the end of Q4, an 11% increase over the year-ago quarter. Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for our Consulting business, ended the quarter at $95 million, up 7% year-on-year and 9% in FX neutral terms.","Consulting gross contribution margin was 26% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Consulting revenue increased by 3% in 2017 and its gross contribution margin of 29% was up 50 basis points compared to 2016. Adjusted revenue in the Talent Assessment & Other segment increased by 2% compared to the year-ago quarter. As you saw in today's press release, we signed a definitive agreement to divest the biggest part of the Talent Assessment & Other segment following a strategic review.","The purchase price is $400 million and we expect to close in the first half of the year. For the full year 2017, the business we are divesting had revenues of about $200 million and EBITDA of about $38 million. Assuming we use the proceeds to pay down debt, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share dilution of about $0.17 for 2018 on a full year basis. The actual impact will depend on the timing of the deal closing.","On a combined basis, SG&A increased by 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. FX had a roughly 1 to 2 point negative impact. We continue to invest in growing sales capacity and sales support areas such as recruiting, technology, facilities and other areas to support our strategy of delivering sustained, double-digit growth over the long-term.","Our sales force continues to be our largest investment. And at the end of the fourth quarter, the heritage Gartner business had 2,807 quota-bearing sales associates. This is an increase of 384 or 16% from a year ago. As we discussed with you last quarter, we have been able to reduce the level of open territories, which should help us as we move into 2018.","The acquisition of CEB added more than 500 frontline quota-bearing research sales associates. We've been focused on filling open territories and our growing sales head count. Going forward, we will leverage our proven best practices around recruiting, training and tools to drive accelerated CV growth and improved productivity.","As you analyze SG&A results, please also remember that there is normally a large seasonal increase in our expenses in Q4 as we are supporting our largest global events as well as our busiest sales quarter. Additionally, in Q4 2017, we incurred about $13 million of non-recurring expenses which are adjusted out of EBITDA. Separately, we had incremental incentive expenses related to our strong selling finish to the year.","With cost synergies, we are on plan. As we discussed in the past quarters, and as Gene just detailed, we are also investing in areas that we believe will drive long-term growth for both the heritage CEB and heritage Gartner businesses. The benefits of some of these investments will yield returns over the next several quarters.","Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $221 million. On a combined year-over-year basis, adjusted EBITDA grew 2% with strong revenue growth partially offset by three primary factors: first, continued underperformance of the Talent Assessment business; second, we performed below our expectations with high-margin exhibitor and contract optimization revenues; and third, higher SG&A costs, as just discussed.","Depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter, predominantly reflecting the addition of CEB, while amortization and integration charges were up significantly, again related to the transaction. Interest expense in the quarter was $36 million, up from $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The full year interest expense was $125 million, up from $25 million in 2016. The higher interest expense relates to additional debt used to fund the CEB acquisition. Again, I'll note that we took on the debt early in the second quarter as the acquisition closed.","The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has significant impact on both our Q4 and full year effective tax rate. In Q4, we benefited from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower corporate tax rate and utilization of some foreign tax credits. This was partially offset by the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. The net benefit to our P&L in Q4 from tax reform was $60 million or $0.65 per share. We have normalized this benefit out of adjusted EPS.","Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter and full year, excluding the one-time net benefit, was 32.8% and 30.4%, respectively. I'll discuss the 2018 benefits of tax reform during the guidance section of today's call. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $1.17, excluding the tax law change benefit of $0.65 in the quarter. Our adjusted EPS result for Q4 is about $0.08 short of the low end of our previous guidance and $0.14 below the midpoint. The primary driver was the EBITDA performance I just detailed.","This was partially offset by a combination of lower equity compensation expense, a lower adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter, and a few other below-the-line benefits. In Q4, operating cash flow was $22 million compared to $83 million for stand-alone Gartner in the year-ago quarter. Our combined operating cash flow decreased 81% year-over-year. Q4 operating cash flow includes significant acquisition and integration payments, which we adjust out for our free cash flow calculation.","Q4 2017 CapEx was $35 million and Q4 cash acquisition and integration payments and other non-recurring items were approximately $27 million. This yields Q4 free cash flow of $14 million. The decrease versus the prior year is due to the higher interest and CapEx. Additionally, there was a one-time $40 million impact from the timing of billings. As part of the integration, we moved clients from the CEB billing platform to Gartner's. This resulted in temporary delays in sending out invoices. We expect this impact to reverse in the first half of 2018.","Relative to the approximately $3.6 billion of gross debt we had as a result of the acquisition, we have repaid more than $300 million by the end of Q4 with a quarter ending gross debt level of approximately $3.3 billion. From a net debt perspective, we had $2.8 billion at the end of Q4, which translates to approximately 4 times leverage on a combined last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA.","Given the favorable cash flow characteristics of the combined company, the repatriation benefits of U.S. tax reform and recent debt repayments, we're tracking ahead of schedule on delevering to reach our long-term leverage target of approximately 3 times gross leverage. In January of this year, we repatriated around $250 million which we used to pay down debt. This is factored into our interest expense guidance for 2018. As mentioned earlier, we intend to use the proceeds from the divestiture of the Talent Assessment business to pay down additional debt. Once that transaction closes, we will update you on the impact to our guidance.","Turning now to guidance. For 2018, we expect adjusted revenues of approximately $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. This reflects growth of 10% to 13% on a combined 2017 revenue. For Research, we expect combined adjusted revenues of between $3.10 billion and $3.15 billion. This reflects combined reported growth of 12% to 14%, supported by the very strong contract value growth we just delivered.","For Consulting, we expect revenues of between $340 million and $355 million. This reflects growth of 4% to 8%. For Events, we expect adjusted revenues of between $380 million and $400 million. This reflects growth of 10% to 16% on a combined basis. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $285 million and $305 million. The signed divestiture agreement is not reflected in this guidance. After the deal closes, we will update the guidance.","For 2018, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $750 million to $800 million. This reflects growth of 8% to 15% on a combined basis. For our adjusted tax rate, our best estimate based on our current understanding of the new tax law is an effective adjusted rate of around 26%. We estimate the benefit of our lower rate at around $0.25 per share on 2018 earnings. However, there is still a fair amount of uncertainty around the implications of the law.","Finally, our EPS guidance is based on a weighted average fully diluted share count of approximately 93 million shares for the full year of 2018. Putting that all together, we expect full year 2018 adjusted EPS of between $3.71 and $4.11 per share. On a reported basis, that's 12% to 24% growth. Had we owned CEB for all of 2017, the 2018 adjusted EPS growth would be over 300 basis points higher. For free cash flow in 2018, we expect free cash flow of $451 million to $491 million. At the midpoint, the conversion from adjusted net income is about 130%.","For the first quarter of 2018, we expect GAAP EPS between negative $0.44 and negative $0.40 per share. This includes approximately $1 per share of non-GAAP adjustments, predominantly related to acquisition charges. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, we expect EPS of between $0.56 and $0.60. All of the details of our guidance are available in the presentation available on the Gartner Investor website.","2017 was a pivotal year in the Gartner journey. We delivered outstanding performance in the heritage Gardner Research business, with strong top line growth and some of the best operational metrics we have posted in many years. We acquired CEB and L2 and have been executing ahead of plan on the integration, cost synergies, and investments to support future revenue growth. We subsequently signed an agreement to divest the non-core business and have positioned ourselves for a strong 2018, a year in which we expect to drive double-digit top and bottom line growth and further strengthen our balance sheet.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler, Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. So, I guess, an order of magnitude question on the margins and the margin headwinds. Fully get that you're investing to support growth and obviously see it in the key metrics. But I guess what I'm wondering is just given the 2018 implied margin guidance, is there anything else in terms of like wage inflation picking up or paying people more because of the tax savings or anything along those lines. Or is this like, I guess, a one-time step-up as you accelerate head count growth and then 2019 there should be better margin flowing through?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Jeff. So, on the opening part of your question, from a planning perspective related to wages and things of that nature, it looks very much like we've seen in previous years, so really no change to report there. In terms of the margins, you're spot on. We are investing to support and drive future revenue growth. And as you followed us for many years, that's been our strategy.","You can see it bearing out on the heritage Gartner Research side with our productivity accelerating, contract value growth accelerating, et cetera. And, again, our plan is on the CEB side to make sure that we are fortifying that business appropriately and also, as Gene mentioned, investing to drive future growth. So, the way we're thinking about it is this is a growth game and we are investing to make sure that we can drive sustainable, long-term, double-digit top line growth.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And I guess with the growth synergies on plan, you're investing more sooner. Is it a timing issue and you still expect to realize the net OpEx synergies from the deal at some point or is there a change in the targeted net OpEx synergy realization figure?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Jeff. It's Gene. I'll answer the first part of the question which is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, both the acquisition close and the acquisition integration has gone much faster than we had originally planned for. We had kind of a middle-of-the-road plan and we wanted to be aggressive and it turned out we could be aggressive both with the closing and also with the initial integration. And so, we're much further ahead than we had in our original plan.","Because of that, we pulled forward some growth investments that we might have made 6 or 12 months down the road, because we believe that that will allow growth to accelerate faster as well. So, fundamentally, what's going on is, we went faster than we had originally expected on both closing and integration. That allowed us to pull these growth investments forward, things like increase the number of salespeople, increasing sales support, increasing customer service, new products that we've developed, closing open roles like with Evanta, for example. All those things are things that are going to have great payoff in growth and that we believe that growth moving forward.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And then, Jeff \u2013 go ahead.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I just was going to finally ask, on cash flow, I understand the premium over adjusted net income as growth rate dependent and you're at the front end of hopefully accelerating the CEB growth. But if I ex out the $40 million timing hit to 2017, which I would think is a benefit to 2018, it looks like the free cash flow premium is quite a bit lower than historically Gartner generated. So, any reason why you can't get back to like 140%, 150% premium over adjusted net income over time?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","That's a great question, Jeff. And I think you're spot on in your upfront assertion. It really does have to do with reaccelerating the contract value growth at heritage CEB. And once we do that, there is no reason why the overall conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow can't be similar to what Gartner looked like prior to the acquisition. So, that is absolutely the goal. And, fundamentally, the business model supports that.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee, RBC. Please proceed.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. So, it's an interesting result because the revenue and all the operating metrics look terrific. And yet, the SG&A spend and the acceleration there in the margins being hurt by that all are a lot worse than anyone expected. I guess a two-part question from me. So, clearly, with the guidance, you're not going to achieve the double-digit accretion bogey that you set out when you announced the CEB acquisition. So, help us think through just how you think about in investing relative to delivery of profits.","And really the second part of that is, why be so aggressive with CEB? The 18% sales head count growth is like almost double the CV target that you've laid out for that business. It just seems like you've gone so aggressively that you're pushing out profits quite a while, and I'm trying to understand how you think about those two things. Thank you.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Let me start with the second one first, Gary. As you know historically with the Gartner sales force, we determined how fast to expand the sales force based on assessing each individual first-level manager and what their capability was to absorb growth. What we did is the same thing on the CEB side. And so, we went through and looked at what's the capability of having more salespeople with each of the individual area managers and with the total number of area managers we had. And that's how we got the number of sales territories that we had.","So, we think it's operationally feasible. And, for sure, as you know, the thing that has driven our growth over time is making sure the sales capacity to actually address this enormous market opportunity that we have. So, that's why we have \u2013 so we've set the growth rate based on what we believe is operationally feasible. Again, as we go forward, if we see that that's too fast or too slow, we'll adjust based on our actual results. And, again, in terms of the issue with our business, you hire the salespeople. They start selling. They sell things. They get contract value and then it turns into revenue. Now, for the other part of the question, go ahead.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yes. Thank you and good morning, Gary. So, I guess, some context around the double-digit accretion question, and how we'll actually measure success. So, just from a starting point, CEB, the acquired business, great research, great products, great content, great methodologies, and the combination of Gartner and CEB is unequivocally better than either company would have been alone.","One of the things we have learned though is that \u2013 and you knew this, too, from following them that they had underinvested significantly in particularly areas that actually we know drive future growth. Since making the acquisition and actually getting in there, we've learned really two critical things. One, the strategic rationale for the acquisition is actually even more compelling than we thought. And two, there are actually more operational areas that needed fixing and significant underinvestment in areas that we know drive retention and growth.","And when we entered into the deal \u2013 and, again, this was January of 2017 when we announced, we couldn't be certain around how long it would take us to close, how long it would take us to integrate. As Gene mentioned, we closed quicker than expected and are executing ahead of our plan on the integration. And so, those things were going really well, and that allowed us to do two things: one, actually start addressing the operational issues sooner or more quickly; and two, pull forward growth investments more aggressively with a higher degree of confidence.","And so, where we are today is we understand the operational issues. We know how to fix them. We're fixing them and making really good progress on that. We've also moved to significantly simplify the business. And, obviously, the announcement on the divestiture of the CEB Talent Assessment business is a big step towards simplification. And so, the transaction or the net result is \u2013 the transaction is still accretive in 2017 and 2018, although less than we originally thought of. But our view is we've made the right trade-off for investors because we get to have a much stronger, better positioned business sooner than we otherwise would have. And then, the other thing I'd say, just to kind of close, is we now have an even higher conviction in our ability to deliver that double-digit CV growth in 2020 than we did when we announced the deal.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. If I could ask just one much quicker follow-up. You mentioned some investments to fortify places they'd underinvested, but, obviously, the sales head count is really proactive investment for growth. Can you give us a sense how much is in each bucket and what's the timeline for that CV to accelerate? It seems to me it's got to be a lot faster than 2020, given how aggressively you've done the integration and hired the sales head. Thank you very much.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah, Gary, I guess two things. One is on the fortifying areas I can give you a couple of examples. Probably the most notable one that has an impact or had an impact on their results were open territories. And so, when we acquired the business, there were significant amount of open territories in the Talent Assessment business, significant amount of open territories in the heritage CEB Research business, frontline sellers and a significant amount of open territories in all the sales support functions, to name a few. And, obviously, we know this from fact. You sell less when you have open territories and when you actually have people in the territory. And so, those are some examples of fortification of the core.","In terms of the goals for the future, we're not adjusting that long-term expectation. That said, as I just mentioned and I think as Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks, all the things we're doing are to drive a stronger business that can grow faster and potentially sooner. We're still targeting that 2020 date for double-digit contract value growth, but we're putting in place all the things that should allow us to grow this business really, really fast, have a lot of strength, and set us up for future, sustained, double-digit growth.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh, William Blair. Please proceed.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just a follow-up on the margin question. I guess to ask in a little different way, I guess, you commented before that CEB essentially kind of was over-earning and had underinvested in a few areas. When we look at the 2018 margins, as you think about kind of given what you now know about CEB and the overall company, I guess, what I'd like to try and understand. Are we under-earning here in this year given the margins? And in other words, I guess, are your margins depressed more so than normal or as we look at this 2018 outlook, is this more consistent with kind of the long-term margin structure as you see what's necessary to grow the kind of combined business?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Tim. Good morning. I'd say it's a little bit of both if you think about it. And so, as you know, our business model around hiring new salespeople, there is a lag in terms of the performance they deliver. And we've gone through this over the years where it takes a few years for a new salesperson to get up to \"full productivity.\" And what that means is, in year one, we're paying full cost, but they're delivering half the productivity. In year two, we're paying full cost, but they're not delivering all the productivity. And then, by year three, they look like a normal tenured salesperson.","And so, what you're seeing on the CEB side a little bit in 2018 is we've got the full cost of the territory expansion, but very little benefit baked into the P&L because it's a subscription-based model. Even if they sell a lot of stuff, it will likely be weighted to the back end of the year, therefore, not really flowing through from a revenue perspective in 2018. And then, we start seeing the benefit in 2019, et cetera.","That said, what Gartner has done is we've got that virtuous cycle, if you will, of we're hiring new sales people, they graduate in tenure, but because we're about the long-term play here and driving sustained double-digit growth, we continue to invest in new people who then come in as new salespeople and then graduate into the tenure band and get more productive over time.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","And, Tim, it's Gene. In addition to that, for the heritage CEB salespeople, there were some differences in how they sold. So they use discount heavily and we don't use discounting. They sold enterprise agreements and we sell seat-based products. Their content of the products is different than it was before. And so, even the existing CEB salespeople, in the short-term, have got to learn different skills to be able to be as effective as they will be when they \u2013 or get up to speed on these.","We're hoping that's a few months, but it definitely takes time to do that. And so, it's a combination of both the transition the existing heritage CEB salespeople have to do to this new world which we're well along and the all good leading (00:46:07) indicators are good, but we're not there yet. Combined with when we hire new salespeople, it takes a little bit of time for them to get up to speed.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just on the exhibitors, can you \u2013 just to ask a different topic here. The open sales territories there, I guess that was something you had talked about a while ago. Is it just harder to find salespeople or what was the issue? I guess why were the territories opened than you expected?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Great question. So, what happened is we had very, very, very low turnover in our exhibitor sales force over a long period of time. We then had a surge. And it's a combination of things that just happened all at the same time, different careers, performance, whatever. It all happened at the same time. We didn't have enough recruiting capacity to match all the open territories we had. So, basically, it took a little while to get to speed. We now have the recruiting capacity to deal with that. We have the territories filled and there's two very good things looking forward to the business.","The first is that our advance bookings for 2018 \u2013 in other words, the exhibitor bookings in \u2013 that will be realized in \u2013 the revenues will be realized in 2018, the bookings for those were up at substantial double-digit rates in 2017. So, we'll see those revenues. So, we go into 2018 with a great, call it, backlog of exhibitor bookings. And then, secondly, our \u2013 and this is important as well. Our attendees last year, as I mentioned in my remarks, were up 17% year-over-year which is an acceleration of tax equated attendee performance, and exhibitor revenues follow attendee revenues.","When attendees are growing, exhibitors want to exhibit those events. When attendees aren't going to do, that's when they are declining, exhibitors don't like so much going to those events. And so, I think the combination of \u2013 we have the recruiting capacity. The territories are filled. Our advance bookings are up substantially. And the fact that the growth in attendees drive future exhibitor revenues gives us confidence that we're in a good track for 2018 and beyond with our events business.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Please proceed.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, guys. First question, just on free cash flow again. I think you said the conversion in 2018 would be 130% after backing out those charges, so just a two-part question. One, like once you sell TA, I guess, does that automatically help that conversion I would think? And then, the $126 million of charges that you have in 2018 like maybe just some color on how that breaks down. It sounds pretty similar to the 2017 number.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Good morning, Manav. So, just a clarifying point. So, the 130% was just taking the 2018 free cash flow guidance midpoint over our adjusted net income free cash flow guidance. If you back out the $40 million reversal, if you will, it's closer to 120% conversion, just to clarify. In terms of the charges, there is a run out of charges, as you'd expect with a large transaction. There is the timing of retention bonuses, when people actually exit the business and get paid severance. We've got charges in there related to the decoupling of the Talent Assessment business. And so, while it looks like roughly the same level of cash on a year-over-year basis, it makes sense and again is related to carryover from stuff from the CEB deal and then a lot of stuff related to the Talent Assessment divestiture as well.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Is it fair to assume though that the TA pulls down that conversion? So, like once you sell it, it should help improve that?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great point. Absolutely. And I think the interesting thing \u2013 and we'll re-run all these numbers once we close the deal \u2013 but, obviously, with that roughly $200 million of TA revenue no longer a part of Gartner, it makes the subscription-based portion of the business an even larger piece of the pie. And you're 100% right. That will help the free cash flow conversion rate on a go-forward basis.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, Gene, earlier, you talked about all the new products in commercial terms and the success you've seen there. I was hoping you could just elaborate a little bit more on maybe some anecdotal points and like how far you are along in that transition to the commercial terms and how many new products more you have in the pipeline and so forth?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Great question. So, in terms of the commercial terms, we introduced the new commercial terms last year. So, all of our salespeople, 100% of the Gartner and CEB salespeople have been selling on the new commercial terms since last year. So, we're well on the way there. And again, some people have switched immediately and are doing great. Others have to learn and it's a different talk track, answering questions like why you can't get a discount (00:51:32) and why you can't get an enterprise group, things like that. But everyone's been doing that and I feel like we're making great progress on that.","In terms of new products, all the new products have been developed. We introduced a few of them last year. A lot have been introduced in January and the last ones will be \u2013 we're going to continue \u2013 we'll have \u2013 continues to do product development, but of the combined Gartner plus CEB content with a seat-based product in the first half we will have most of those out. Now, we're going to continue innovating because, as you know, on the Gartner side, we have products for the C-level, a different product for \u2013 that reports to the C-level, et cetera. And over time, we'll be rolling those kinds of products out as well throughout each of the CEB or the heritage CEB roles like HR, finance, et cetera.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh, Gartner (sic) [Credit Suisse]. Please proceed.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Follow-up on the margins. Ask another way, have you guys fully captured the investments that may be required at CEB? It seems in the three quarters you've reported since acquiring the business you've had three negative EBITDA surprises. And I realize it's not all attributable to CEB, but fiscal 2018 is also well below EBITDA expectations. So, how confident are you that you've identified the speed bumps, et cetera, that you've spoken to in the past? Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","So, Anj, what I would say first is that we had CEB advantage where we understand what the economics are and what the business is going to be like. And, over time, there's no reason \u2013 in fact, it's our expectation that the economics would be very similar to what Gartner was before we acquired CEB. And so, there's some upfront investments which we've talked about in the call and other times. But, over time, there's no reason margin shouldn't be very comparable to what we've done with Gartner over time.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And, Anj, I would just add. In terms of the speed bumps, for lack of a better term, a lot of the downside we saw over the course of the year related to the Talent Assessment business and as we got in there and really analyzed it, there were a number of things that were causing that, most notably a significant amount of open territories. And so, we did invest to fortify that, fill open territories. If you look at bookings performance on that business, it was definitely better in the second half of 2017 than it was in the first half of 2017, and we got that out of the way. And, again, now, once we close that deal, that will no longer be a part of the overall Gartner business.","The other thing I'd mention is just in pulling out the TA business, when it does happen, essentially it's been a low growth to no growth, declining-type business. And, obviously, with it coming out, just the raw Gartner growth rates will improve by 50 or 60 basis points on a comparable basis, and that will obviously help us on a go-forward basis as well. The other areas where we've seen those speed bumps, again, we've seen lots of positive signs after we've identified, assessed, and fixed them, whether it'd be around retention rates which again we've seen improving over the course of the year, whether it's around the performance from a bookings perspective on the Evanta business, in terms of their advance bookings and things of that nature. So, I think we feel good that now with essentially nine or 10 months of CEB under our belt operationally, we've identified all the problem areas. We've actually addressed them as well and should be operating from firmer ground on a go-forward basis.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, maybe I missed it in your prepared remarks, but what sort of CEB growth is implied in your 2018 guidance? And if you could just help us with what you're seeing as being most instrumental in the acceleration of the CEB growth we saw at CEB this quarter, has it been the contract term is changing, the investments in sales force, or the new products? Thanks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Let me get to the second part first. So, the reason that we saw the acceleration, they were in the negative growth category for quite a period of time, and we see that uptick. The biggest issue has been the six-point improvement in retention I talked about which is an enormous amount in one year. And that's due to change in operational practices in terms of instituting some of the practices that you know so well from Gartner. So that's kind of what caused that improvement. And we're getting there. There's no reason that their retention, their wallet retention, client retention, can't be at the same exact levels as Gartner. And we see that happening over time, and then new business growth, again same levels.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And on the implications within the guidance, we're obviously not breaking that out. But it's safe to assume in line with or a little bit better than reported contract value growth for the heritage CEB contract value. So, we said 1.5% on the overall heritage CEB contract value growth in 2017. That obviously drives the bulk of the revenue as we head into 2018.","Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Based on the numbers that you gave, Craig, it sounds like there's part of the Talent Assessment business that is not being sold in this transaction. And so, I was hoping you could give us some color on either what part you're keeping or if you're planning on selling that remaining piece as well. And basically, if you are keeping it, just what's the growth rate of that piece and will that impact the overall business?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Toni. So, as we talked about, we're selling about two-thirds of the Talent Assessment & Other segment, which consists essentially of the business formerly known as SHL that CEB had acquired in 2012. And so, that's about, as I mentioned, $200 million of revenue and about $38 million of EBITDA. And so, that's a little bit different than the contribution margin, because it is inclusive of SG&A, but on a net basis, about $38 million of EBITDA. So, that will leave us around $100 million of other, if you will. And those are predominantly training businesses and a few other smaller acquisitions that CEB had done over time. And it's again now representing post-divestiture $100 million on a $4 billion business, so a really, really small part of the overall business with what I would say our kind of average CEB growth rates associated with it. So, that's what will be left. Again, a really small part of the overall total Gartner revenue portfolio.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And we've seen a couple of data points recently indicating that IT spend should be strong this year and accelerating from last year. It sounds like just based on the guidance you've had some strong growth rates for each of the segments there. How are you thinking about the overall environment? Would you be able to maybe raise prices faster this year or just see greater demand for services? It just sounds like the environment is really good, and so I just want to get some color on what you're seeing.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Hi, Toni. It's Gene. So, first, I'd like to kind of just address one point which is that our growth is not really linked to IT spending. I mean, clients use us and need us when their spending is higher or even when their spending is lower. They're still spending an awful lot of money on IT. And whether it's growing at 3% or 4% or 1% or shrinking 1%, they still need a lot of help, and so that's not been a big factor for us. Having said that, the selling environment I would characterize today as being a normal selling environment. Meaning there are clients that are booming, there are clients that are okay, and clients in trouble if you look around the world and the different markets that we're in. So, I'd characterize it kind of a normal selling environment.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari, Macquarie. Please proceed.","Kayvan Rahbar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. This is Kayvan Rahbar filling in for Hamzah. Post tax reform, could you give us an update on how you're thinking about capital allocation priorities in the M&A pipeline?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Sure, a great question. So, obviously, the one other benefit of tax reform that isn't really factored in is the ability to repatriate foreign accumulated earnings. And, obviously, as we talked about during the prepared remarks, we've been knocking down our debt levels and again we view the optimal cap structure to have something in the neighborhood of 3 times gross leverage. And we're moving in that direction pretty rapidly. And when we closed the Talent Assessment divestiture, it accelerates our ability to get there. And then, of course, we have the great free cash flow generation of the combined business globally on a go-forward basis.","So again, our view is about 3 times gross leverage is the right permanent fixture on our balance sheet. And then, once we get there, we return back to what our previous capital allocation strategy was, which was a combination of strategic value-enhancing M&A, which more likely in that means smaller to mid-size type acquisitions or in absence of that, return of capital to shareholders through our buyback programs. And so, once we get back down to those rough levels of around 3 times gross, we'll then revert back to our stated, tried and true capital allocation strategy around M&A and return of capital through buybacks.","Kayvan Rahbar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And just a quick follow-up, anything from your customers in terms of spend? Are you hearing anything?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Again, it's Gene. Well, I'd say as I characterized it as a kind of normal environment, which is that the spending is \u2013 again there are companies that are doing really well that are kind of spending money on all kind of things, companies that are doing okay and companies that are in trouble who needs help figuring out how to allocate their funds even better. And so, I'd characterize kind of a normal selling environment, not especially good and not especially bad.","Kayvan Rahbar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Reid, Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to hop over to Consulting, where there was a couple issues last quarter, but it looks like you kind of progressed and are moving past those with the update. Do you think this improvement will continue and did the strong pipeline that you talked about in the last period continue?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Great question, Michael. I mean, as I mentioned, Consulting, we had, again, some open territories there among our Managing Partners for different reasons, health, career change, et cetera, and not across the board, but it's of selected areas. Those have now been filled and we had a really good backlog. The backlog was up 9% year-over-year, which is great. And we feel very good about the strategy for Consulting, fit with the company. And at our (01:04:13) Investor Day next week, we'll talk more about how that strategy is evolving, to make it even more important and contributing to the company.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And, Michael, you're right. I'd point out a couple of facts. One is the labor-based portion of the business was up 12% in the fourth quarter, which is a really nice improvement from what we had seen, particularly in the first half of the year. That was offset a little bit by weakness or softness in the contract optimization business in the quarter.","What I'd say is the contract optimization business actually had a very strong year, really super strong in the first half and then below our expectations a little bit in the second half, but overall delivered nice growth for us for the year. So, I think your observation is right. Labor-based was very strong in the fourth quarter. And, again, the backlog position we're in is probably the best or one of the best backlog positions we've been in entering a year in a while.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then with the integration kind of, you said to be ahead of track and the synergies definitely being met, could you remind us again where some of these cost synergy savings are coming from and maybe where you expect them to come from moving forward?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yes, sure. On the cost synergy side, I guess, I'd start with when we assessed the deal upfront and looked for cost synergy opportunities, we did not look in research because that was really the most important asset and we wanted to maintain that. And we didn't look in sales because again, as we know, the more salespeople you have, the more you generally sell. And we didn't want to touch service either. So, the cost synergy opportunities really fall in the G&A lines. And I'd put them in a handful of buckets.","So, one is around redundant people, redundant functions, redundant processes. So, in finance, as an example, we only needed one CFO. And so, there was a savings opportunity there. We're consolidating everything into Gartner's accounting systems, Gartner's billing systems, Gartner's HR systems. Gartner's IT systems, et cetera. And so, as we do those consolidations and integrations, costs will go away. So, it's really around, first, the people and leveraging our centers of excellence and eliminating redundant roles.","Two would be around eliminating redundant external spends whether they'd be on consultants, on software applications, on data centers, on things like that. And the one caution there is we're moving really well and rapidly, but there are certain elements of those spends that due to contract terms or due to needing to run dual or parallel platforms for some point of time, those don't get turned off until maybe 2019.","And then the third major category is probably around facilities and consolidation of facilities. And so, we've started that in 2017 in some of our smaller city locations around the world. We're doing it much more aggressively in 2018 and there will remain opportunities to do that in 2019 and beyond. So, really focused on the G&A side and really focused around leveraging our scale whether it'd be on personnel, on external spend or on facilities.","Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. I hate to go back to the accelerated spending but I'm going to. I'm just curious when these decisions were made. I don't remember you talking about plans on doing this on the last quarter's call.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Hey, Jeff. Good morning. So we've tried to be \u2013 we've been, I think, transparent on this. We talked about, I believe, on the Q3 call about our accelerate \u2013 on the territories specifics. It's a related support, so recruiting capacity, service people, the incremental territories, et cetera. So, it's now becoming real because we're actually doing the spending and hiring the people, but we have talked about it on at least last call and I think the two prior calls.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Maybe I just missed the order of magnitude. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of George Tong, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Gene, I want to dig deeper into the pull-forward of investment spending. Can you discuss the planned timing of investments in 2018 and how your planned heritage Gartner sales force growth will compare with heritage CEB sales force growth?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yes. So, in 2018, the heritage Gartner sales force growth is going to be typical of past years, so in the same kind of range that we've had in past years. And, again, I can't give an exact number because as I've talked about, we do it based on what our operation capacity is. So, we look at each individual area manager and based on the capacity of those individual managers decide what it's going to be. But you can think about it as being kind of in the mid-teens like it has been historically for Gartner.","For CEB, we're following the same process. What we decided to do, again, was to pull forward and try to go into 2018 as fully staffed as we could on the CEB side. We're now going to see how those investments go. And based on the operational performance we'll decide how much hiring we're going to do through the year to prepare us for 2019. Right now, we're staffed and we're very happy with where we are in terms of the staffing in sales, in service, in product, and sales support.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And how would you think about the cadence of investments, just the timing of investments as you move through 2018?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Well, again, on the Gartner side, it's going to be what we've done traditionally, which is we tend to ramp up more salespeople at the beginning of the year. It tends to be front-loaded. Our biggest selling is in the second half for new business. And so we want to let people get up to speed. And so we tend to time more of our growth hiring in the first half, so we go into second half with a full complement. And, again, as I mentioned, the CEB is sort of a similar kind of a thing except \u2013 because it's new, we're going to be even more watching kind of the operational performance.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And just to follow up, you discussed the biggest driver of improvement in CEB performance has been really due to improving wallet retention rates. Can you elaborate on how much new business is performing, how much it's growing at CEB, and discuss trends around pipeline growth and close rates for CEB?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yes. So great point. So retention itself is up significantly which was driving wallet retention. New business hasn't performed as well and the reason is because of things we talked about, all of the changes that part of the CEB salespeople got to go through in terms of the change in commercial terms, new products, new enterprise agreements, all the things that we've talked about there. And so, last year, the new business was weaker than it had been historically.","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","And, George, good morning. It's Craig. This is what we've talked about for the last two or three quarters. We were focused on trying to get as much noise out of the way in 2017. When Gene discussed earlier about the speed of our integration, it was really around, number one, we saw the opportunity to go faster. Number two, we wanted to enter 2018 with as much behind us as possible. And that's why we pushed forward so much on changing the commercial terms and eliminating discounting and launching these new seat-based products. And so, there was a lot of change with particularly heritage CEB frontline sellers, which we've managed through and Gene talked a little bit earlier about adoption and speed of adoption. But, again, the goal was to get as much noise, if you will, behind us, so that we could enter 2018 in as clean a position as possible.","George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to David Cohen, Street name, Serious D (01:13:20). So, a question for you on the open territories. You've mentioned that a number of times as a problem that you've been addressing. And I remember, historically, a few years back, you spent a lot of time and effort to try to come up with processes to really reduce the sales force turnover post hire. And so, my question is what are you doing on the front-end on the CEB hiring, given the strong hiring there, to make sure you got the right people in those territories and that they're going to stay there long enough to get a positive return?","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. Bill, that's an important area of our focus. And so, over the last several years actually, we focused on building a recruiting capability that has a great ability to identify who are the people that are going to be most successful in selling at Gartner because we want to hire \u2013 when people are successful, they stay. They don't turn over. And we wind up with our average tenure going up and higher sales results. We've done that through both improvements in our selling process, as well as things like analytics where we use a series of analytics to help us determine who are the people that are most likely to be successful and necessarily a recruiting process that actually is very good identifying those people.","That's been very effective on the Gartner side. We're implementing that same recruiting \u2013 in fact, the same recruiting organization with the same processes, once they get fully rolled out, the same processes that we'll have at the CEB side. And right now, we're part way through that journey. We're probably the majority of way through the journey, but not completely there on the CEB side. Once we get there, we expect our ability to identify the right people to hire will be great. Already, capacity-wise, we don't have any problem as you can tell from the growth in sales force that we talked about and we feel very good about the quality of people that we're hiring and they are fit.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And then one quick one on the CEB Talent Assessment. You've mentioned the $400 million gross proceeds. How should we think about the net proceeds on that?","Craig W. Safian - Gartner, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, obviously there are some fees that go out related to bankers and lawyers and also other associated costs. I think we've modeled in probably $350 million of that being available to pay down, maybe a little bit more, but in that neighborhood.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back to Gene Hall for closing remarks.","Eugene A. Hall - Gartner, Inc.","Well, thank you today for your questions and for joining us. So, to summarize the key points for today's call, 2017 was a great year for Gartner. In the heritage Gartner Research business, we accelerated contract value growth, drove higher retention, and improved sales productivity, which resulted in its best year ever. Heritage Gartner Events had strong attendance. And while exhibitor sales were below our expectations, we have strong forward exhibitor bookings. Consulting 2017 revenues were below our expectations, but we ended with a strong backlog there.","We acquired CEB for the strong strategic benefits of extending our market to all functions across the enterprise and also to enable best of both operational approaches. The rapid closing, aggressive integration timeline, and accelerated growth investments, together with our initial operating results, give us a high degree of confidence that we are well on the way to achieving our strategic objectives and delivering consistent, double-digit growth over the long-term.","We continue to get better, stronger, faster, day after day, year after year. We've got great momentum as we enter 2018 and we expect to continue our trend of double-digit growth for years to come. As most of you know, we'll be hosting our Investor Day next Thursday, February 15. We'll review our businesses in more detail, and you'll come away with an even better understanding of our strategy and what we're so excited about our prospects for sustained, double-digit growth. We look forward to seeing you there and on our earnings call next quarter. Thanks for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."]}}
