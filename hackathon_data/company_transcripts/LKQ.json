I'll now turn the call over to Joe Boutross, LKQ's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joe Boutross","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Michael Clark, Vice President of Finance and Controller.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Nick Zarcone.","Nick Zarcone","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to share the results of our most recent quarter with you. But before I jump into the review, I would like to introduce Varun Laroyia, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As many of you read from our press release in September. Prior to joining to LKQ on October 1, Varun was the Chief Financial Officer of CBRE's Global Workplace Solutions Business. A multi-billion full service real estate outsourcing firm with approximately 40,000 employees in over 50 countries. So from a size, scale and level of complexity it was quite similar to LKQ.","Prior to joining CBRE in 2015, Varun spent close to 10 years at Johnson Controls in a variety of senior financial positions around the globe. And prior to that, he held diverse financial positions both overseas and in the US, at Gateway Computers, General Electric and KPMG. In short, Varun brings significant global financial and operational expertise to LKQ will be an outstanding addition to LKQ's unique people culture and I'm thrilled to have him on the team.","Now onto the quarter; all in all we believe this was a strong quarter for our company and we're very pleased with the results. As noted on Slide 4, consolidated revenue was $2,466 million and 11.7% increase over the $2.2 billion recorded in the third quarter of last year. Total revenue growth from parts and services was 11.4%. Importantly, organic growth in parts and services was 3.2% on a reported basis and after taken into account the impact of one pure selling day in 2017 compared to 2016. Global organic growth was a solid 4.7% on a per day basis. Very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth at this level.","Income from continuing operations was $122 million an increase of 11.4% as compared to $110 million for the same period of 2016. On an adjusted basis income from continuing operations was $140 million an increase of 11.1%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.39 in Q3, 2017 as compared to $0.35 for the comparable period of 2016. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.45 compared to $0.41 for the same period last year.","Let's turn to some of the operating highlights. All you'll note from Slide 6, total parts and services revenue growth for our North American segment grew 4.3% in third quarter of 2017 compared to the comparable quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for this segment was 2.5% on a reported basis and after taken into account one less day in North America, organic growth was 4.0% on a per day basis.","A particular note, this solid performance during the quarter was achieved notwithstanding the fact that our Houston and Florida markets were confronted with devastating hurricanes. The Houston area experienced upwards of 50-inches of rain in certain areas, resulting in unprecedented levels of flooding. And the winds in Florida created significant damage and knocked out power in many areas for several days. As a result, our eight Houston area locations and in majority of our 79 Florida locations were shut down for a few days resulting in some loss of business both prior to the storms and their subsequent aftermath.","Importantly to LKQ, our employees and their families in both markets are safe despite many sustaining damage to their homes and having to deal with the challenges of managing their daily affairs. Fortunately the company didn't experience any significant property or asset loss at any locations in either Texas or in Florida. When taken into account the impact of the storms, we believe organic growth for parts and services on a per day basis would have been even a bit higher if not for these unfortunate events.","On the bright side, the negative earnings per share impact from the storms in the quarter was far less than we initially anticipated. As witnessed for several quarters now, we continue to grow our parts and services revenue faster than the market as a whole. Accordingly, to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims on a national basis were actually down four tenths of 1% in the third quarter of 2017, so our per day growth of 4% reflect significant out performance. This growth gives us confidence that we're continuing on the right track by offering our customers products that represents a significant value proposition in the midst of ever increasing repair cost. Our solid revenue growth is also impressive because according to the US Department of Transportation miles driven in the United States during July were up only eight tenths of 1% on a nationwide. With miles driven in the Northeast in South Atlantic regions up only two tenths and four tenths of a 1% respectively.","So, when you consider the hurricane impact, negatively repairable claim data and soft growth in miles driven, our North American segment really came through in terms of the top line revenue while importantly reporting the best gross margins and EBITDA margins of any third quarter in the past five years. I could not be more proud of the effort of the team.","As I relate to the recent hurricanes, according to CCC there were over 300,000 total loss vehicles between both storms. Similarly, the Hurricane Sandy in 2012, we believe that surge and storm related total loss vehicles creates a dynamics for us that increase the volume of our bidding and procurement efforts at auction and in turn further enhance our inventory levels to continue to growth of our recycling business.","Turning to our ongoing intelligent part solution initiative with CCC, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders, process through the CCC platform during the third quarter grew 21% and 21% respectively year-over-year. While we're very encouraged by the progress it's important to recognize this program represents a small part of our North American revenue. Lastly, we integrated five PGW branches into existing LKQ facilities during the third quarter and we have an additional five branch consolidation scheduled for the remainder of the year. And that will bring the total consolidations for the year up to 14. These consolidations will help reduce the cost structure on a going forward basis.","Moving to the other side of the Atlantic. Our European segment achieved total revenue growth of 23.8%, importantly organic revenue for parts and services witness growth of 4.4% on a reported basis and 5.6% on a per day basis given we lost one selling day in the quarter. While all the geographies saw strong results the operations in Eastern Europe again led the way with double-digit organic growth. Operations opened for more than a year accounted for about two-thirds of the 5.6% per day organic growth with the impact of new branches accounting for the balance [ph].","Acquisitions added an additional 16.5% revenue growth in Europe during the quarter, while the strengthening Euro resulted in about 3% increase due to foreign exchange. During Q3, our collision parts revenue at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of over 16%, so a continuation of very robust activity. Also, our UK based industry relations team during the quarter secured four insurance repaired agreements that include a combination of collision parts and paint supplies tied to a specific level of repair volumes mandated through a large number of independently owned body shops throughout the UK, this bodes very well with a continued growth of this product line in the United Kingdom.","During the third quarter we opened up total of six branches in Europe, including two new locations in the UK and four in Easter Europe. Also during the quarter, we rebranded seven PR Reilly locations in the Republic of Ireland and they're now on the ECP trading platform. With respect to the Tamworth warehouse project, which we refer to as T2, our team continues to be on plan and within budget. I'm pleased to announce that as of today a 158 of our ECP branches are currently being delivered out of T2 and we expect the full branch network to be serviced out of T2 by the end of November.","Following the full branch migration, we will begin the process of rationalizing two of our smaller facilities with one being closed early in 2018 and the other by mid-2018. With respect to Andrew Page, on September 14, the CMA releases provisional findings which indicated that there may be a requirement for us to divest up to 10 of the 99 acquired branches. We're continuing to work with the CMA to address any potential issues with respect to those particular 10 locations.","The CMA will announce their final decision on or about November 6. Once issued and assuming the whole separate order is removed or at least relaxed which we think should be the case, our team in the UK will begin to work hard to integrate the operations, but it's important to recognize that integration process is complex, and it will take several quarters to be completed. And finally, our specialty segment continues to perform very well achieving organic revenue growth of about 2.7% during the third quarter and after taken into account the one last selling day, organic growth for specialty with a solid 4.4% on a per day basis.","During the quarter, we witnessed continued favorable sales trends for vehicles in our specialty sweet spot namely light trucks, SUVs and RVs. These positive trends were a bit offset by the impact to the hurricanes in Texas and in Florida. Our corporate development activities continued in earnest as evidenced by our acquisition of 11 businesses during the third quarter. These include four aftermarket parts distributors in Belgium, a wholesale distributor of light vehicle parts in Poland, a recycled parts and tire business in Sweden. And automotive workshop business in Sweden, a small specialty parts and accessories distributor in Germany and a full service salvage yard in Kentucky.","We also purchased two services orientated businesses including a garage management software business in the Netherlands and a developer of management system software for recreational vehicle dealers in the United States. Also, as announced on Monday we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the aftermarket business of Warn Industries from Dover Corporation. Warn offers a product line of aftermarket winches, hoist and bumpers and has an absolute iconic brand that will enhance the market position of our specialty segment. This transaction is expected to close sometime in the fourth quarter.","We continue to look for opportunities to grow the breadth and depth of our customer offerings through the addition of successful, well managed businesses to our family of companies around the globe and the pipeline of potential transactions is robust.","And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun and Michael, who will run you through the details of the consolidated and segment financial results.","Varun Laroyia","That's great. Thanks Nick and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I'm delighted to be part of the LKQ leadership team and I look forward to sharing our financial results with you for many quarters to come. Over the past few weeks, I had an opportunity to meet with several investors and key stakeholders such as our banking partners, equity analysts, insurance companies and others. In variably, the discussion moved to why I decided to join LKQ? Listen, while a major career change is never simple, it really came down to a few key items.","First, I believe the growth potential of LKQ is significant both organic and through acquisitions. It's not very often that one gets an opportunity to join a company that is a clear leader in its core categories and key markets around the globe and a very significant potential to growth further through acquisition, both the customer offering and geographic footprint. Second, the stage at which LKQ is currently fits well into my skill set of having built and operated multi-billion businesses in a variety of sectors and geographies. This affords me the unique opportunity to help build the company into a substantially larger and an even more progressive enterprise in the foreseeable future.","And finally, the cultural fit, this aspect was incredibly important for both the company and me. I truly appreciate the transparent culture, the core values and the unwavering integrity of LKQ. Personally, I thrive in such scenarios as it is core to who I am as a person. Each of these elements taken together created an opportunity that I simply couldn't pass out.","And now onto the results, Nick touched on a few of the key financial stats. I will take you through the more detailed review of the consolidated results and then I'll turn it over to Michael to address our segment margins for the quarter. Nick described the trends behind our reported revenue of $2.47 billion so I will start with our consolidated gross margin. As noted on Slide 13 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was flat quarter-over-quarter at 38.8%. We saw some relatively minor ups and downs across our segments that effectively method out to know year-over-year change.","Segment EBITDA total $267 million for the quarter reflecting a $21 million or 8.4% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. As Nick previously mentioned, there was one fewer selling day in the third quarter of 2017 compared to 2016, which negatively impacted our segment EBITDA dollars this period. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was 10.8% versus 11.2% recorded in the third quarter of 2016. We saw a 50 basis point increase in our operating expenses, this was largely due to our European segment as we continue to experience a negative impact from losses associated with the Andrew Page acquisition and higher operating expenses mostly related to distribution in our Sator business.","Until we receive final clearance from the CMA, we are unable to begin the process of integrating the Andrew Page and this has left us with certain cost inefficiencies. During the third quarter of 2017, we experienced a $2 million in restructuring cost compared to the prior year, but a $4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense largely due to the recent acquisition. With that operating income for the third quarter of 2017 was about $16 million or roughly up 9% when compared to the same period in 2016.","Interest expense was a little less than 2% up quarter-over-quarter as we had similar average borrowings and effective interest rates. Non-operating items were favorable by about $3 million versus prior year as Q3, 2017 included a $1 million gain on bargain purchase primarily related to adjustments to the Andrew Page net asset values. We pull this gain out of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS. Other non-operating income which increase by approximately $2 million versus Q3, 2016 includes foreign exchange gains and losses and various ancillary income such as late payment fees. Pre-tax income during the third quarter of 2017 was $178 million up $18 million or 11.4% compared to the prior year.","And then coming onto taxes, owing to our latest forecast of geographic mix of earnings. We've updated our projected full year 2017 base tax rate down 40 basis points to 34.75% before any discrete items. The update in the forecasted effective tax rate and the discrete benefit of the stock-based compensation resulted in a reported rate of 32.7% in Q3, 2017. The comparable Q3, 2016 reported rate of 31.2% applied the same 34.75% base rate, but benefited from higher discrete stock plan deductions.","Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were $0.39 which was up 11.4% compared to the $0.35 reported a year ago. Adjusted EPS which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and other one-time items was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2017 versus $0.41 last year, reflecting a 9.8% improvement. And finally, strongest scrap and other key metal prices headed about half a penny to EPS in the third quarter of 2017.","And as we anticipated, after annualizing the effect of the BREXIT role to the UK, the impact of currencies was minimal during the quarter. And with that, let me turn it over to Michael to give you further details of our three segments. North America, Europe and specialty.","Michael Clark","Thank you, Varun and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll take a few minutes to address our three segments. Particularly as it relates to some of the margin dynamics. Going to Slide 16, gross margins in North America during the third quarter were 43.6% up 20 basis points over the 43.4% reported last year. The strong results reflected the benefits of procurements initiatives in our salvage operations and increased margins in our self-service due to rising scraps deals and other metals pricing. Partially offset by reductions in our aftermarket business due to higher customer discounts and input cost.","With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment. We improved operating margin by approximately 10 basis points compared to last year. We saw a benefit of about 40 basis points from eliminating shared PGW corporate cost after the sale of the OEM business in March 2017. Outside of this benefit, overhead expenses were up 30 basis points which related to various individually insignificant items mostly in distribution cost. In total segment EBITDA for North America during the third quarter of 2017 was $153 million, a 9.2% increase over last year.","As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.9% in Q3, 2017 up 40 basis points from 12.5% reported last year. While the margin was down sequentially in Q3, we've typically experienced the seasonal dip in the third quarter and as Nick noted 12.9% is on the high end of the range of what we've seen in the third quarter in North America over the last five years. Looking in Slide 18, scrap prices were up 37% over last year and moved about 8% higher in Q3 relative to Q2. The benefit from scrap reflects a sequential movement in pricing as car cost will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower overtime, so we benefited from the sequential increase in scrap prices this quarter, but to a lesser extent than it experienced in the first quarter of this year.","Moving onto our European segment on Slide 19, gross margins were 36.4% in Q3, a 20 basis point improvement over the comparable period of 2016. Our Sator business had a net favorable 60 basis point quarter-over-quarter impact as a result of increased private label sales and to a lesser extent the conversion of the Belgium market to two step distributions. As noted on the last call, we've been working on procurement initiatives across our European organization including negotiating, consolidated rebate and discount programs with suppliers. And those efforts produced a 30 basis point improvement in margin in the quarter.","Our ECP operations had a 60 basis point negative effect primarily due to higher cost related to the T2 national distribution center. Gross margins at Rhiag were down versus the prior year which is attributable to lower margins and businesses acquired into the group in the last two quarters. With respect to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we experienced the 140 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis quarter-over-quarter and 40 basis point sequentially. The factors negatively impacting operating leverage remained similar to prior quarter, the inclusion of Andrew Page just still losing money while we operate under the whole separate order and higher distribution cost in our Sator business.","European segment EBITDA totaled $79 million, a 9.2% increase over last year. As shown on Slide 21, relative to the third quarter of 2016, the Pound Sterling was flat, and the Euro strengthened about 5% against the dollar. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA in Europe increased by 5.8%. As a percentage of revenue European segment EBITDA in the third quarter of 2017 was 8.3% versus 9.4% last year, a 110 basis point decline. Approximately 100 basis points to this decline relates to the impact of Andrew Page and the incremental cost in 2017 related to T2. And a one fewer selling day relative to the prior year quarter also negatively impacted our leverage on fixed cost compared to the prior year.","Turning to our specialty segment on Slide 22, gross margins for the third quarter increased 10 basis points compared to last year. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in specialty were also consistent with the prior year down about 10 basis points. We did see an offset in other expenses of 30 basis points due to foreign exchange losses and decreases in miscellaneous income items relative to the prior year. Segment EBITDA for specialty was $35 million up 2.9% from Q3, 2016 and as a percentage of revenue segment EBITDA was down 10 basis points to 10.6%.","Specialty is a highly seasonal business and the second quarter is typically our strongest. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, we saw a segment EBITDA margin decreased 280 basis points sequentially. Similar to prior years, you should assume a further sequential decline in segment EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. let's move on to capital allocation, as presented on Slide 24, you will note that our cash flow continuing operations during the first nine months of 2017 was approximately $453 million as we experienced strong earnings while investing in working capital to support our growth. Through September, we deployed $382 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses including $132 million to fund capital expenditures and a net $250 million to fund acquisitions in other investments.","The largest capital changes reflect the net pay down of almost $350 million of debt largely funded by the proceeds derived from the sale of PGW glass manufacturing business in March 2017. Going to Slide 25, as of September 30, we had about $3.2 billion of total debt outstanding and approximately $275 million of cash. Resulting in net debt of about $2.9 billion or 2.5 times last 12 months EBITDA. We've more than $1.3 billion of availability on our line of credit which together with our cash yields total liquidity of over $1.6 billion.","At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Nick to cover the guidance update.","Nick Zarcone","Thank you both for that financial overview. With respect to our guidance for 2017, we have made some minor tweaks based on where we're sitting nine months through the year. Organic growth of parts and services has narrowed a bit to 4.0% on the low end, to 4.5% on the high end reflective of the fact that we're at 3.8% for the first nine months. Likewise, we have narrowed the range for our adjusted diluted earnings per share to a $1.86 on the low end and $1.92 at the high end increasing the midpoint to a $1.89 per share. The corresponding adjusted income from continuing operations is $575 million on the low end to $595 million on the high end.","Cash flow from operations has been revised to a range of $600 million to $625 million and capital spending has been revised down to a range of $175 million to $200 million. The updated guidance reflects an effective tax rate of 34.75% exchange rates in the fourth quarter of $1.30 for the pound and a $1.18 for the Euro and scrap at approximately $160 per ton.","In summary, Q3 was a solid all round quarter. These terrific results reflect the collective efforts of our more than 40,000 employees around the globe who are working hard to serve our customers each and every day. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their dedication and for being LKQ proud.","Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","So, first question from me. Anything to call out for the slightly slower daily organic growth in Europe and specialty. And then sort of second to that, are you expecting that growth to stabilize in the fourth quarter or pick up a little bit.","Nick Zarcone","[Technical difficulty] really happy with the growth rate per day basis, [technical difficulty] on a going forward basis.","Ryan Merkel","Okay and then just secondly and the line was kind of coming in and out my phone, I didn't catch all of that answer, but second question ahead was North America gross margin it's sort of trended down since the first quarter. I know it's still up year-to-date but anything going on there and should we assume stable at 43.6% from here.","Michael Clark","[Technical difficulty] North America [technical difficulty] to the business look on the chart on [technical difficulty] pattern will likely continue but broadly speaking staying in this range is a good assumption.","Ryan Merkel","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Samik Chatterjee","Nick, I just wanted to check I know you stopped giving sort of the organic growth numbers for the European business by the three business groups like Rhiag, Sator and ECP, but is there anything you can sort of give in terms of directional ball park numbers about how they're tracking, how they track this quarter.","Nick Zarcone","If you - the Rhiag business again because that's where all the Eastern European operations are centered right, have the highest organic growth of the three companies, if you will. ECP, good numbers and kind of net bid single-digit level. Sator was a little bit lower than the exceptional performance they had in Q2, but all in all we're happy with the growth rate.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. And a couple of housekeeping questions, I saw the cash flow from operations came down slightly what led for the guidance for the full year that came down, what led to that? And when I look at the 2017 EPS guide, the only change from the 2Q seems to be the equity method investment sort of block of $0.02 so what's driving that?","Nick Zarcone","Yes, so on the operating cash flow, we plan to enhance investment in inventory as we continue to grow our businesses, so we brought OCF down by about $25 million, likewise the capital spending is running a little bit light, so we brought that in at $25 million, so if you want to think about free cash flow the estimate for free cash flow basically stayed the same. Your other question was?","Samik Chatterjee","On the change in the 2017 guidance, the change in the midpoint of the guidance seems to be driven by contribution from equity method investment.","Nick Zarcone","That relates to [indiscernible].","Samik Chatterjee","Okay and that wasn't expected back in 2Q?","Nick Zarcone","We did not explicitly call that out in Q2, you're correct.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay, so just a final question for you and how's the acquisition of the aftermarket business of Dover this week, which you mentioned on the call. If I understand correctly, do they have manufacturing operations, and do you intend to keep the manufacturing operations as well?","Nick Zarcone","So, you're talking about Warn Industries which we purchased or are going to purchase. We've not yet closed from Dover Corporation. Yes, they have manufacturing operations and yes, we're going to and to keep those manufacturing operations. The specialty leadership team has had kind of vertical integration as part of their strategy for quite some time, this is the first opportunity to bring something to fruition, we're only going to do it in very select circumstances cases where there is market leader with a strong brand that we can control a business that operates in a large market with good growth opportunities. What Warn represented was an undisputed market leader. They've got about $140 million of revenue which is about 10% market share of slightly more than a $1 billion market. They've got an incredible brand identity. Vehicle owners ask for the Warn product by name, very good margins to this business, Samik. Circa 20% so from a margin perspective it will be accretive to both the specialty margins and our consolidated margins. We believe that just going to be an opportunity for ancillary revenue flow because in many cases you cannot put their product on a factory issued bumper, so we think it's going to be an opportunity for ourselves few more bumpers and importantly it's going be a bit accretive to the 2018 EPS.","So, this case we're able to acquire only the aftermarket business. Dover actually retained their OE business, so this was a much simpler transaction then say the PGW situation. Again, at the end of the day, we think it's a great opportunity, it fits well into our product set, it's got our brand that we can control, and we like being in charge of the distribution. And from a size perspective it's about 1% of our consolidated revenue. So just keeping in perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison","So, you've seen maybe an increase in competition in Europe, we've seen a North American distributor enter the French market. I'm wondering if you see that as validation of your strategy or whether you might see that as a strategic threat to some of the other things you want to do in Europe.","Nick Zarcone","Good morning, Craig. Yes, as everyone probably knows, several weeks ago. GPC which had a NAPA brand here in the US announced their maiden voyage in the Europe, by buying Alliance. Which is a large enterprise headquartered in France, significant operations in France, a bit in Germany and then significant operations at UK as well. We believe Europe is an outstanding marketplace, we've been asked quarter after quarter for the last several years, why aren't all the other US companies in Europe and we could not answer that question. We're just happy that we' were the first mover and have the largest market share in [indiscernible]. So, we think yes, Craig it really goes to show that our strategy in Europe is indeed a good and effective strategy.","Look Alliance is a very good competitor in the markets in which they participate, we don't see any material changes. Due to ownership by GPC, they're a very good company, they're very good operator and they're very disciplined and at the end of the day we think that's just fine.","Craig Kennison","And then real quick, could you just comment on the revenue margin and strategic implications of your RV systems management business and your Netherlands management system.","Nick Zarcone","Yes, those just so you know those are two very, very small businesses. Okay, but let's take the Netherlands business, right. We sell parts to largely the independent mechanical repair shops. Those folks are very good at fixing cars. Their shops that maybe have six [indiscernible] and eight mechanics. What they're not good at is actually having a CRM system where they can stay in touch with their customers, blast out emails, promotions for oil changes or break jobs or whatever the case maybe. What this company does is to provide that kind of - of that capability for that independent garage owner, by us providing that software to our customers it will help them grow their business and our clearer goal is to use that incremental service in helping our customers to get a bigger piece of their wallet, when it comes to parch purchases and alike.","Again, in the RV side, again it's providing an incremental service to our RV dealers. What we intend to do is use that to help drive a higher level of revenue, get a bigger share of the dealers' wallet when it comes to type of parts that we sell.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordon from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Could you talk a little bit about the impact on cost of goods from what you're going to see on the salvage auction coming out of the hurricanes, something 300,000 cars, freshwater damage, a lot of truck and SUV mix? Maybe the magnitude of the benefit and the timing.","Nick Zarcone","Yes, so the best way to track that is, our experience coming out of Sandy back in 2012, the reality is, there's going to be a lot of good salvage coming to market. We can't buy it all, we can't dramatically up our purchase of cars because we need to have a place to put the cars. You can't put 40 acres of cars in a 30 acre salvage yard. And that's true with us, that's true with everybody. So, we think, these cars come to market we're going to be able to buy a high quality car and an average revenue per vehicle will be a bit higher because it's not like the front end is gone or the back end is gone, right. The reality is, more parts are going to be available for sale. And we think we can get some good pricing again it's supply and demand Bret, right. And with a flood of cars coming to the market at the end of the day that should help a bit. There's not going to be massive changes, massive gains from the cost of goods sold perspective, but on the margin over the next several quarters there should be a little bit of benefit flowing to all the recyclers if you will, ourselves included just from the incremental volumes coming to the market.","Bret Jordan","Okay and then a question on alternatives parts penetration, you talked about other claims rates being down four tenths, a 1% yet pretty strong organic growth. Do you have a feeling for what the AI penetration might be now?","Nick Zarcone","Our sense is, is it's probably nudging up slowly. The 4% per day in North America actually our salvage and what I would call our core aftermarket product and I think about the Keystone product in the box in glass where all nicely above the 4%. Obviously, we're still continuing to feel a little bit of softness and a little bit of negative comparisons and things like paint, cooling and wheels. And then our smaller businesses like our heavy duty truck business and reman business, we're kind of in the low single-digit. So again, we think that based on our experience we can't speak for the rest of the industry, but based on our experience APU is probably nudging up a little bit like here in 2017.","Bret Jordan","Okay and did you give an ECP comp number, the store is open 12 months or longer for just ECP?","Nick Zarcone","No, again. We're moving towards reporting European on a segment basis, given that we're now operating and in 15 different countries, we've significantly added to our presence and places like Belgium and Ireland and Poland and alike and but again the positive trends continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Your line is open.","Ben Bienvenu","I want to ask Nick you gave some sense of magnitude of the Warn acquisition, can you help us think about what other product categories you could bolt-on in either the specialty business or North American business that you're not currently in today.","Nick Zarcone","Well again on the specialty side, we're distributor at heart. There are other really strong brands in that specialty space if they came for sale and if they had those characteristics that I described, large markets, leading market shares, the ability to add and growing to adjacencies we could add. I can't give you a specific product type, Ben at the moment because it will be really any of the product types that we sell out of our specialty business and as you know, I think last year we sold 275,000 different SKUs including parts from 800 different vendors. But it would have to be a leading brand that really made a difference.","Ben Bienvenu","Fair enough. And then pivoting to Europe. Andrew Page continues to be an incremental drag on the results, can you talk about some of the key factors driving the OpEx headwinds. I recognized that you're not able to integrate the business today, but it looks like there is a light at the end of the tunnel potentially in the event of potentially gaining regulatory approval. Can you give us the sense of the critical path for synergy capture?","Nick Zarcone","If you think about Andrew Page, they're losing money, their revenue under prior ownership hit a decrease because they weren't investing in the business, they were not investing in inventory. But they still had a national distribution center that they had to cover the cost on, they still have the corporate office that they have to cover the cost on, and that's why they're losing money. I mean those overhead cost relative to their revenue rate are just too high. Ultimately with T2, we don't need their national distribution center. Okay and while we need some of the people in their corporate office, we don't need the total duplication and so those where the real opportunities are. Michael, you mentioned I think in your call the impact of Andrew Page on margins for Europe.","Michael Clark","Yes, it was 70 basis points on the operating expenses set on the European segment.","Nick Zarcone","Yes so 70 basis points on Europe overall just from Andrew Page, which means if we get it to be breakeven, we pick up 70 basis points in Europe. And we're going to get its profitability. But it's going to take some time as I mentioned in my comments. The integration is measured in weeks or months, it's measured in quarters.","Ben Bienvenu","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","James Albertine","So, wanted to just, as maybe a follow-on to that previous question, that was more focused on Andrew Page and I think we can sort of see the light at the end of the tunnel. Ben mentioned but the pressures that you noted I think it was 60 basis points of margin pressures in the Benelux. Little less clear to us at least what the path forward for correcting that. Can you maybe shed some more light or dig in a little bit deeper there as to what needs to happen and how long that will take?","Varun Laroyia","Yes, certainly so this is Varun Laroyia. Let me climb on to that one, to give you a more complete picture about the European OpEx headwinds. So apart from the T2 and the Andrew Page piece that Nick just mentioned, the other one was in the third quarter as we called out, we acquired some businesses in the Sator business again going from a three step to a two-step distribution, methodology. Now with those set of acquisition, there is a slightly different higher cost structure, but essentially that gets offset by a higher gross margin profile for these businesses. So that's one aspect you kind of take into account, just in terms of what took place in the third quarter with the Sator acquisition, the BCC entities and also call systems in the Netherlands, that's point number one.","The other one to think through is, as we kind of move forward and we begin to integrate those recently acquired businesses into the continental mainland platform. We do expect there to be further synergies, so as you think about a single ERP versus running a multitude of those, that certainly gives us the benefits also, so apart from the Andrew Page and the T2 piece that was mentioned previously this was the other aspect that I'm hoping you get a little bit more insight into it.","James Albertine","And similar with Andrew Page, we're talking about weeks and months, not quarters here in terms of the moving to a single ERP and transitioning kind of to the broader European platform.","Varun Laroyia","Yes, so listen as you would have noted, I spent quite sometime over in Europe and had done similar acquisition integration listen as much as I would love to say it's matter of weeks and months, swapping out ERPs and changing out whole scale systems takes a little bit longer than that. We certainly have started the work on that front, optimistically I'm looking at the back end of 2018 into 2019 to be able to kind of simplify some of those recently acquired businesses. So, it has a slightly on the tail, but again we have a great game plan, we've got a great leadership team out there and they've got their initiatives laid out pretty well in terms of how they're going to tackle this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open.","Brian Butler","This is Brian Butler for Michael. Just one question on the Warn acquisition, now that you've kind of stepped into that vertical integration and become somewhat of competitor to some of your distribution partners, have you had any push back or feedback from those product providers?","Nick Zarcone","We have not, although it was just announced on Monday, so of this week so it's only four days ago. The reality - this is a product that the vehicle owners demand by brand. And I think the other distributors who are selling the product are still going to want to sell the Warn product because of the brand identity it's a very good product for everybody in the distribution of specialty product.","Brian Butler","And how about the products that you guys sell through your own partners? I mean is there I guess any pressure then to possible of those partners either not selling through you anymore but going someplace else because you're now a direct competitor.","Nick Zarcone","No, we don't anticipate any significant change there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Stratton of Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.","David Stratton","When we look at the planned automatic transmission repair business scheduled to start in 4Q, how is that coming along? Are there any updates that you can give us in regard to that?","Nick Zarcone","Yes, you're talking about our announcement a couple quarters ago of greenfield being a reman transmission business in Oklahoma city and the update from our leadership team just on the last few days, is they anticipate the first transmissions will be coming off the reman line in the first or second week of November, so we're pretty much right on track. Now it's going to start slow, but build from there over the next several years.","David Stratton","Great and then, when we talk about the impact of the hurricanes, you mentioned pretty thoroughly the impact on salvage. Will there be any to scrap steel prices that you anticipate going forward, where there might be a lower scrap price in the future?","Nick Zarcone","We don't anticipate any significant moves. Obviously, all those total loss vehicles are sooner or later once we and the other recyclers are done with them, I'm going to head to the metals processors to get recycled and like. So, there will be some incremental volume, but when you think about the total amount of steel is recycled in this country and used around the globe, we don't see any material pressure. Our average scrap prices last week were right in the $160 a ton range, which is down a little bit from maybe a month ago, but not materially.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Nick Zarcone","So, we thank everyone for participating on this third quarter call. We do know that this is a very busy time for all you and we appreciate your time and attention. Again, we think, we had a great third quarter, we're looking forward to a good fourth quarter and we'll talk to you at the end of February with our year end results.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Joseph Boutross","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning, as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.","Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies.","Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.","Dominick Zarcone","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour.","This morning, I will provide some high level comments related to our performance in the second quarter, and then Varun will dive into the segments and related financial details, before I come back with a few closing remarks.","When taken as a whole the second quarter of 2019 played out largely as we anticipated when we announced our first quarter results 90 days ago. There were both some clear positive movements and some disappointments, but we are encouraged by the overall result.","On the plus side our North American segment experienced a significant uptick in both gross margin and EBITDA margin, which gives us confidence that our disciplined approach to the market and keen focus on controlling our cost are creating positive outcomes.","Also our global focus on trade working capital management lead to significant cash generation, which was well ahead of our 2019 expectations. While there were some positive items related to the timing and we will give a bit back as we move through the remainder of the year, we are ahead of our initial plan from a free cash flow perspective for the first six months and we believe we will remain so for the balance of year.","On the plus side, we knew we had very difficult year-over-year revenue growth comparisons with respect to both our North American and European segments, but the organic revenue growth came in below our tempered expectations.","Additionally, there was one less working day in Europe in the second quarter of this year compared to last. So it's important to focus on the same day result, there is no doubt that the soft macroeconomic conditions across Europe are weighing on our industry and our revenue comparisons.","We are performing better than many of our peers, but organic revenue in Europe was down and that softness lead through the operating margins. And finally, by quarter end scrap prices fell further 20% from the March 30th levels, which impacted Q2 results and will continue to weigh on our result for the balance of the year.","Now onto the quarter. As noted on Slide 5, revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $3.25 billion, a 7% increase over 3.0 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2018. Parts and services organic revenue growth for the second quarter of 2019 declined 2.1% on a reported basis, but when adjusting for the one less selling day in Europe the decline in organic revenue or parts and services, was 1.3%.","Net income was $150 million compared to the $157 million for the same period of 2018, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2019 was $0.48 as compared to $0.50 for the same period last year. However, the second quarter of 2019 results included a non-cash impairment charge of $25 million net of tax.","Regarding this impairment charge as we reported last quarter, we intend divest a few of our non-core business units over the next year and thus have recorded related assets and liabilities held for sale. Each period we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets.","In the second quarter, we concluded that the expected recovery would be less than carrying value, and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of about $0.08 a share, which is excluded from our calculation of adjusted diluted EPS.","On an adjusted basis net income was $204 million an increase of 6% compared to the $192 million reported for the same period of 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2019 were $0.65, compared to $0.61 for the same period last year, a 7% increase.","With respect to capital allocation, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock returning approximately $120 million of capital to our stockholders. Since initiating our plan in late October 2018, the Company has repurchased 9.3 million shares for a total of $251 million.","Let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7, organic revenue for parts and services for our North American segment declined [four tenth] (Ph) to 1% in the second quarter of 2019.","As anticipated the PCW glass business and the airplane recycling operations exhibited a decline in same day growth, while the largest part of our North American segment that being in the automotives salvage and the aftermarket parts operations exhibited positive same day growth of approximately [seven tenth] (Ph) to 1%, while our focus on driving profitable revenue growth has the result of shaving off some low margin revenue it has the material positive benefit our margins.","We continue to form well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC collision and liability related auto claims were again down 2.6% year-over-year in the second quarter. This softness was nationwide with 40 of the 50 states recording a decline in repairable claims.","Additionally miles driven has slowed with the lower growth coming from increased vehicles and operation versus miles driven per vehicle and increase in the number of people working from home and the shift towards online shopping.","Despite some macro industry challenges on the top-line and facing another tough comparison against the second quarter of 2018, our North America's team's focus on profitable growth drove excellent year-over-year margin improvements. Segment gross margins were 44.1% and EBITDA margins were 14.4%, reflecting improvements of 100 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of last year and representing some of the highest level in the history of the Company.","Furthermore, when we move into self-service business, the business unit that experienced the greatest downward impact on margins from the decline in scrap prices. Gross margins and EBITDA margins for the rest of our North American segment were up 160 basis points and 190 basis points, respectively. Bruin will address this some more detail, but I wanted to highlight the positive results from our margin enhancement efforts.","We also continue to grow our parts operations with aftermarket collision SKU offerings and the total number of certified parts available growing 5.4% and 11.5%, respectively year-over-year in Q2, related to certified parts as some of you may be aware, in late June LKQ receive notification from NSF International that it will discontinue its automotive parts certification business and affiliated automotive certification and registration programs effective September 30th of this year.","Many parts which are certified by NSF are also covered by CAPA a largest certification body and we are confident going forward that discontinuation will not have a material impact on our certified parts availability.","Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 18%, primarily driven by the acquisition of Stahlgruber. Organic revenue growth for parts and services in the quarter of 2019 declined 4.3% on a reported basis and was down 2.8% on a same day basis, which was below our expectations.","As noted by other public companies with European exposure, the softness is an overall industry headwind not an LKQ specific issue. Indeed our performance on a relative basis appears to be fairly strong, which gives us confidence that we are not losing share.","Additionally, the diversification of our geographic footprint in Europe generally reduces the volatility in our segment performance because we are not overly exposed to reliance on any one specific country, while we don't disclose country-by-country detail, I will note that Italy was the softest in terms of organic revenue growth and the Eastern block was the strongest, albeit still below its historically high levels.","Europe has seen many of its economy slowing as evidenced by negative or flat GDP growth and lower new vehicle sales. Discussions with our suppliers and other industry participants have confirmed the downward pressure that poor economic growth across the continent is having on the European parts marketplace.","The consensus view is the soft economic conditions have led to an initial deferral of repairs and maintenance. While a near-term headwinds, we believe that core automotive maintenance can only be deferred for so long and the demand will eventually rebound that said we anticipate the soft industry conditions will continue through the balance of 2019.","We believe our team has done a reasonably good job of reacting to the new revenue paradigm, but the revenue decline have resulted in a deleveraging of our operating expenses, and lower margins when compared to the prior year.","Lastly on Europe, during our investor day back in May 2018, we outlined some of the key categories of focus designed to drive the future performance of our European enterprise. There were both some near-term and longer activities identified and we are making good progress on each of these initiatives.","Since them we have also spent considerable time strategizing about how to best optimize the strength of our various businesses in Europe and to that end, we have engaged with a third-party consulting firm to assist in this ongoing review. Once complete, we will likely settle on an even broader and deeper array of initiatives than those highlighted a year ago.","To be clear, the primary focus of this optimization project is to create an even stronger enterprise and to enhance our already leading competitive position in the markets in which we operate, by providing a best-in-class customer experience.","To do that across our European platform, we intend to transform and more fully integrate the European businesses to operate more as a single entity. The transformation will be designed to allow LKQ Europe to take advantage of its scale and be more efficient entity.","We anticipate most of this analysis will be completed in the next two months and we are currently targeting a call with the investment community in the second week of September, so we can share some of the key highlights of the project including the anticipated long-term benefits of the optimization initiatives, as well as the related costs required to complete the transition.","Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the second quarter, specialty reported flat total revenue growth with organic revenue growth for parts and services of 1\/10 of 1%, being offset by negative impact from currency.","Specialty witnessed particular softness in Canada, which accounts for about 10% of the segments, revenue, largely related to Canada\u2019s weak economy. Additionally RV part sales were off slightly due to lower dealer retail sales across all regions.","Our Specialty team is laser focused on spending controls, which will continue to help offset the impact of lower revenue. Despite the softness, light truck and SUV star rates still running at healthy levels and the number of RVs on the road are at an all time high, favorable dynamics for our RV business and the RV replacement part offerings.","Moving on to corporate development. It was a relatively quiet quarter from a corporate development perspective, closing on just three smaller transactions, including two companies in the United States and one regional distributor in Belgium. For a total net consideration of $38 million.","Our pipeline of opportunities remains quite healthy, and we will continue to acquire businesses that can add value from a customer offering or geographic perspective. Additionally, our development team continues to make solid progress with our assets held for sale efforts and during the quarter we entered into a definitive agreement to divest a small operation in Europe, which we expect to close in the third quarter. ","Finally, during Q2 we opened up three branches in Western Europe, and one in Eastern Europe, while closing five underperforming locations, including one in Western Europe, and four in Eastern Europe.","And with that, I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our updated 2019 guidance.","Varun Laroyia","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. Overall, we feel that the second quarter was a qualified success, providing some positive developments in our North America segment and also free cash flow generation, while also offering a few areas for improvement.","Before diving into the results. Let's start with the key financial highlights. Operating cash flows in the second quarter were $461 million, the highest quarterly amount in the Company's history by a factor of more than two times.","Free cash flow from the quarter totaled $413 million dollars, or $282 million higher than the same period in 2018. We have talked about the past few calls about our emphasis on cash flow generation. And I want to thank our teams across all three segments for their efforts to deliver substantial year-over-year growth. We are raising a full-year guidance for free cash flow, more details a little later.","The strong cash flows enabled us to buy 4.4 million units of LKQ stock for approximately $120 million in the quarter. Additionally, we also paid down debt by $220 million in the quarter and in the six months through June 30th, have paid down $281 million.","Returning cash to our shareholders, while reducing our net leverage ratio speaks to the strength of our business to generate strong consistent cash flows. Our North America segment was able to withstand some revenue softness to process highest segment EBITDA margin percentage since the second quarter of 2017.","I want to commend the North American management team for taking a proactive approach to protecting margins to offset inflationary pressures, and proactively working to optimize its cost structure. Our European specialty segments also face soft revenue and we are taking actions in both segments to advance our stated strategic objectives and address current market conditions.","Last quarter, we disclosed our plans to divest certain low margin business that fall outside of our core operations in geographies. This quarter, we are announcing a restructuring program that we expect to enhance our competitiveness in the current macroeconomic environment.","The restructuring program covers all three of our reportable segments and advances our efforts to eliminate underperforming assets and cost inefficiencies. With underperforming assets we intend to close branches and warehouse locations that are not supporting a sufficient return on investment.","Our current plan includes approximately 40 locations across the business, both in North America and Europe. We intend to migrate as much of the revenue as possible from these locations to other facilities in the LKQ network, but there will likely be some low margin revenue loss as a result of the closures.","The restructuring charges will include facility closure costs, such as lease termination fees and moving expenses to relocate inventory and equipment. Additionally, through this process we have identified selective personal reduction that will benefits future periods, but will require upfront severance that will be charged to restructuring.","We estimate that the restructuring program will cost approximately $25 million to $30 million over the next year to implement and will generate savings of a similar amount on a run rate basis. While this program represents a significant move forward in our plans to improve our competitiveness we will continue to evaluate our businesses and cost structure to identify further opportunities for simplification and cost efficiency.","Regarding Europe the restructuring program was aid our efforts to deliver sustainable double-digit segment EBITDA margin. These efforts are part of, but do not reflect the entirety of the optimization project that Nick referenced earlier.","In conjunction with European margins I want to highlight that we expect various integration costs such as ERP implementation to have a negative impact on that segment EBITDA margin over the implementation timeline. We have incurred some of these cost in the past, including in the second quarter, but expect some acceleration as the integration projects ramp-up.","We think it will be important for investors to understand the nature and amount of these enablement costs and therefore we will provide disclosure of the expenses incurred as part of our quarterly reporting cadence.","Now I will cover our consolidated and segment results, to save myself on words when I refer to net income and diluted EPS. Please note that I will be referring to the amounts from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders. In addition Nick covered the details on net income and earnings per share. So I will not repeat.","Please turn to Slide 12 and 13 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated second quarter results. The consolidated gross margin percentage increased 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.4%, driven by 100 basis points improvement in North America.","While Europe was flat compared to 2018 as we discussed previously, there is a negative mix impact at the consolidated level as the lower gross margin European segment makes up a larger percentage of the overall results and hence has a dilutive effect on the consolidated margin. The mix impact will be less impactful going forward now that we have annualized the Stahlgruber acquisition.","Our operating expenses increased by 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter with a rise in our European segment. Restructuring and acquisition related costs were $8 million as a result of ongoing expenses related to acquisition integration activities previously disclosed, as well as some initial charges of approximately $5 million from the restructuring initiatives.","Interest expense was favorable by $2 million or 6%, compared to the second quarter of 2018. going to both lower interest rates and lower average debt balances. Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.1%, which is roughly in-line with our full-year estimate.","Please turn to Slide 16 for highlights on segment performance, starting with North America. Gross margin was 44.1% or 100% basis points higher than last year as I previously mentioned. For the most part, the margin expansion reflects the continued benefits of pricing initiatives in both our aftermarket and salvage operations, as well as effort in our glass business to get recognized for the quality of service and the breadth and depth of inventory that we provide and renegotiate underperforming contracts.","We had an additional non-recurring benefit of 25 basis points related to an insurance settlement that was realized in the quarter. The self-service operation was a drag segment gross margins, with a quarter-over-quarter decrease due to scrap pricing.","Sequential changes in scrap prices had an unfavorable impact of $2 million for the quarter, compared to a positive impact of $4 million in the second quarter of 2018, creating a $6 million year-over-year negative swing.","Operating expenses were unchanged at 30.1% relative to the prior year, given the pressure on both parts and services and other revenues, and the resulting net leverage effect, holding the percentage flat and actually reducing the absolute dollars by $4 million is a very respectable outcome.","This quarter is the first quarter without a quarter-over-quarter increase in expense as a percentage of revenue since the third quarter of 2017. Wage inflation and higher medical costs continue to negatively impact our operating leverage. Though the North America team had effectively managed expenses to counteract a portion of the impact.","We generated further savings through improved safety performance have seen through a reduction in workers compensation themes and a favorable variance in bad debt expense from ongoing collection efforts. In total segment EBITDA for North America was $190 million up $15 million compared to last year. And as a percentage of revenue was up 130 basis points from the prior quarter.","We have been talking about North America's margin enhancements over the last year, and the numbers show the progress that is being made. A year ago we disclose a 130 points decrease in segment EBITDA margin in a period with 7.4% organic parts and services revenue growth.","This year, North America recovered the full 130 basis points in margin, despite the 40 basis points organic parts and services revenue decline. We are also encouraged by the fact that the North America team still feels that there are additional cost efficiency opportunities available and is working on plans to achieve these savings.","Moving on to the European segment on Slide 19. Gross margin in Europe was 36% flat to the comparable period of 2018, centralized procurement yielded a 50 basis points improvement from supplier rebate programs as we continue to benefit from the Stahlgruber synergies.","With respect to operating expenses we experienced a 100 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter sales decline, partially attributable to one fewer selling day in the quarter had a negative impact of operating leverage. Given the segments relatively high cost base primarily with personnel costs.","Additionally, there was a 30 basis points headwind associated with the ongoing transformation efforts, primarily the ERP and the broader project that Nick referenced. Partially offsetting we had a 30 basis point decrease going to reduce bad debt expenses as the team's focus on collection efforts.","European segment EBITDA totaled $116 million a 5% over last year. As shown on Slide 21 relative to the second quarter of 218 both the Sterling and the Euro each week by approximately 6% against the U.S. dollar causing a negative effect from consolation.","This was offset by favorability in transaction gains and losses netting to an immaterial impact on adjusted EPS for the quarter. Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% for the quarter down 90 basis points compared to the same period a year ago.","As noted earlier, have taken action through restructuring programs throughout our European operations and we continue to believe that we have the best assets in Europe and are poisoned to achieve significant integration synergies. As Nick mentioned earlier, we will provide an update to the investment community in September on the European transformation project.","Turning to the specialty segment on Slide 22, gross margin declined 130 basis points in the second quarter, relative to the comparable period a year ago. Office amount 60 basis points related to higher net product cost as of supplier discounts were lower than those realized in the prior year. The balance related primarily to unfavorable product mix.","Operating expenses improved 40 basis points with reductions in personnel and freight costs more than offsetting higher facility expenses related to warehouse expansion projects that went live after the second quarter of 2018.","Segment because for specialty was $52 million, approximately four million down from the second quarter of 2018, and as a percentage of revenue down 90 basis points to 12.7%. The specialty team is taking cost actions to protect its margins, aimed at producing benefits in the second half of 2019.","Let's move on to liquidity and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 24 and as previously mentioned, you will note that our operating cash for the second quarter was $461 million or 152% higher than the second quarter of 2018.","On previous calls we have talked about driving working capital improvements and the team did a phenomenal job this quarter. It was a total team effort as all three of our segment's contributed with North America and Europe posting significant gains.","Our key working capital accounts that is trade receivable, inventory and payables generated a cash inflow of $189 million this quarter compared to an outflow of $49 million in the second quarter of 2018. I wanted to especially mention to the North America team for working with our vendor partners to ensure LKQ receive market conventions payment terms, no different than other large customers and to the European team for its disciplined purchasing approach in light of soft creating conditions.","As you would expect, I do want to offer a few words of caution on the strong year-to-date cash flows. There will be ups and downs in working capital and cash flows as we move throughout the year, based on seasonality and the timing of certain transactions.","We will also actively use our liquidity to pursue opportunities that support our business objectives, for example, in funding the restructuring costs and those of our key vendor partners by making selective inventory purchases.","CapEx for the quarter was $48 million, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter for $413 million and $537 million on a year-to-date basis. And finally moving to Slide 25, as of the June 30th, we had $376 million of cash resulting in net debt of about $3.7 billion or 2.8 times last 12 months EBITDA.","Now, I would like to spend a few minutes and provide an update on our annual guidance. Please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels. Additionally, the guidance continues to assume no material disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union, currently scheduled to occur on the 31st of October.","As Nick noted earlier, the second quarter came in-line with our expectations. North America performed well and we expect Specialty to bounce back in the second half of the year. We see challenges with European economic conditions holding for the remainder of the year.","And despite the underlying businesses being resilient, the management team will adapt to the software market conditions by accelerating the integration and cost efficiency programs. In addition to simplifying by carefully evaluating various programs that may not deliver benefits in the near-term.","As mentioned earlier, scrap metal prices have continued to trend down and British pound is trending lower, based on the ambiguity that continues to reign in the United Kingdom with a new prime minister and his very definitive views on Brexit.","Given these scenarios, we are trimming our 2019 full-year guidance by 2.5%, or $0.06 at the midpoint for adjusted EPS, while increasing expected free cash flow for the year by $50 million.","Let me run through the updated guidance figures. Organic parts and services revenue growth revised to 50 basis points to 2% for the full-year. Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis is updated to a range of $1.73 to $1.81 accounting for the first half activity primarily related to the non-cash impairment charge I referenced earlier.","Adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $2.30 to $2.38. You will note that at the midpoint of the range, we are down $0.06 per share from a prior guidance. Of this, $0.035 relates to low scrap prices and FX rates relative to our prior guidance and the remaining $0.2.5 largely reflects the net anticipated ongoing softness in Europe in the second half.","Cash flows from operations has been increased to a range of 800 million to 875 million and capital spending is reduced to a range of 225 million to 275 million resulting in a net increase at the midpoint to free cash flow for the full-year by $50 million, despite the trim in earnings.","In summary, the second quarter have separate highlights shrink where our actions of bearing fruits such as North America margins and generating strong free cash flow that is funded the ongoing share repurchase program and debt pay down.","However, the softer macro conditions in Europe and the volatility in scrap and FX give us full support and hence we have trigged a cost reduction and efficiency programs to adjust to the market conditions. Overall, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future.","Now I will turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks.","Dominick Zarcone","Thank you, Varun for that excellent financial overview. In closing I would like to review a few of the key initiatives discussed on previous calls that will continue to be points of focus during the balance of 2019.","First, we will integrate and simplify our operating model. Second we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth to create sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will drive better levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy and fourth, we will continue to invest in our future.","As you can see from the second quarter results these programs and targets are gaining momentum throughout the organization and the teams are actively working towards achieving the respective goal. I am proud of the momentum we have created with our second quarter performance and how our team of over 51,000 employees performed a various market challenges in both North America and Europe.","Importantly, I want to recognize our leaders across each of our segments have embraced our productivity initiatives and the performance and compensation metrics, we have implemented as we progress through 2019 and beyond. I am confident these factors will create long-term value for our stockholders.","I look forward to having you joining our European discussion in September and we will announce final details as we get closer to that call. And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator instructions] Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.","Daniel Imbro","Yes, thanks. Good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning Daniel.","Varun Laroyia","Good morning.","Daniel Imbro","Wanted to think about the European margin actually Varun starting with the gross margin-line. I think you said gross margin were flat year-over-year despite a 50 bip tailwind from procurement and we left some of the issues from Q2 last year, but if you could just kind walk through some of the puts and takes of what is going on in that line and then as comparison get more difficult in the back half, how you guys are expecting that gross margin on the trend in Europe. Thanks.","Varun Laroyia","Yes. Absolutely Daniel and good morning and thank you for calling at the hour. Yes. If you think about our European gross margin it was flat and deep, so you actually read that correct. You really think about it in terms of while we did get the centralized procurement benefits with the organic decline coming through there is pressure on margins, right.","And so, as you think about other competitors also out there, the one area where they go through to be able to kind of sustain the revenue side is on the margin peace of it. So margin did come under some pressure as a result of that.","Nothing more, nothing less, we have always had those competitors are there. But clearly with a falling market as such, that is really where folks end up in trying to give value to their customers. So there were some pressure from that perspective.","I think if you step back and think about it, while the headline number would suggest that the European segment EBITDA margins declined by call it 90 basis points a year-over-year. Put this entire piece into context, as you think about the fact that a year ago, Europe delivered at 8.3%, organic growth number.","This year, the reported number is negative 4.3. That is 12.5 percentage points swing. And as you think about the fixed cost structure, largely you know a more so in the European Space. That is the kind of deleverage that ends up coming through.","And even if we were to be able to hold flat, for example, rather than negative 4.3, if it were flat, and you were to run the math, the SG&A or the OpEx expenses would actually declined by 100 basis points with all other things being similar.","So think about the deleverage that takes place in a market that is shrinking. And it doesn't just show up in the gross margin-line, it actually shows up in multiple lines, in terms of not being able to get the operating leverage.","Operator","Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Hey , I'm sure there will be more questions on Europe. But I wanted to shift to North America and the collision business. How do you explain that soft collision trend? And to what extent is the total loss rate which appears to be climbing, resulting in fewer repairs and really just fewer opportunities for LKQ?","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Craig. This is Nick. Thanks for your question. We have a very deep and ongoing relationship with CCC. We get a lot of data from them on a on a quarterly basis. And when we sat with them a couple weeks ago, we asked them point blank, their perspective as to the decline in repairable cranes in particular, because that is really what drives our business.","In general, they indicated that the winter of 2019 was a bit milder than 2018 and that has an impact of reducing collision volume, if you will. And there is no doubt that on April 1 beginning of the second quarter, right, the collision repair shops have less backlog, if you will, in 2019 than they did on April 1st of 2018.","You are absolutely right. Total loss rates have continued to nudge their way upward just a bit. And on the margin that takes a few cars out of the repair shops and put some into the salvage auctions, which is not a bad thing for us, because we have more cars to purchase.","Total loss rates for the June 2018 to May 2019 time period was 19.3% that compares to 18.7% for the June 2017 to May 2018 time period so up just about a half a percentage point or so. Miles driven, has really started to flatten out from May 2018 April 2019 up only [six tenths] (Ph) of 1% compared to the May 17 to April 18 time period and most of those miles there increase is in fleets as opposed to personal miles.","What I would call the accident-prone portion of the population think about our teenagers out there and then maybe some of the very elderly, they are not in the fleet segment and so that they believe and we believe it\u2019s having perhaps a slight impact as well.","So the good news on a longer-term basis is that the number of cars in the sweet spot is up and APU continues to shift upward very slowly, but it does shift up a bit and we believe quite frankly that account for the positive spread between our organic growth and actually the negative repairable claims growth. And lastly obviously we were measuring against a 7% comp of Q2 last year and those comps will get a little bit easier in Q3 in a much easier in Q4.","Operator","Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Michael Hoffman","Hi, I\u2019m going to change gear completely and talk about cash. Looking at the revised guidance, my thinking about the second half correctly, if I take the midpoint of the net income in the free cash flow. It would suggest you do about 300 million in net income helps about 180 million of DNA and then setting that some of the other things in the cash flow statements unchanged other than working capital. That is the comment you made Varun, is there is about 140 million or 150 million walked back of working capital in the second half and that puts you at the midpoint of the cash flow from ops.","Varun Laroyia","Yes Michael. So yes, good morning this is Varun actually. And yes I think the mechanic to fuel utilizing in your model from free cash flow or an OCF prospective are appropriate and I think if you also kind of look back into it, you just take 2017 and 2018 two prior years. We typically do have an outflow on create working capital in the second half verses the first half.","So in terms of different ways to look at it, clearly with the slide frame of 20 million, 25 million at the midpoint for adjusted net income, don\u2019t also forget that with the restructuring program that we called that also takes us back.","So I would not say the usage on a working perspectives is about 140, 150 I think just take into account the lower earning plus also the restructuring that we called out that will be utilizing cash and then just in terms of the first half, second quarter use of free working capital.","Overall the mechanics that you are thinking of are appropriate and hence both Nick and I referenced that there will be certain timing associated with payments. But we do expect there to be certain opportunities for us to be able to invest more on the inventory side, just given the state of the market on a broader basis. If not us, that is seen some on a softer revenues, it\u2019s happening to competitors and we are certainly seeing it from some of the suppliers specifically over in Europe in terms of what they have been calling out.","But thank you for the question, we are very pleased with the way cash is been coming through the business and really happy with the momentum that we picked up from the second half of last year and that is carried into 2019. We believe there is more to come.","Operator","Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Stephanie Benjamin","Hi, good morning.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning.","Stephanie Benjamin","I was hoping if you could talk a little bit about just the headwinds we are seeing from the aviation, and glass businesses. And when you would - start wrapping those. I understand it's just kind of a comp because they are small businesses where small base, but you can see some nice swings quarter-to-quarter. So just first, just when we should expect to comp some of that going forward.","And then additionally, if you could just walk through in a little bit more detail, just what is driving the kind of significant margin improvement in North America, whether it's pricing, just cost control, just as any - a little bit more color on how we can think about that going forward would be helpful. Thank you so much.","Dominick Zarcone","Okay, great. Well I will start. Clearly, we indicated in past calls, as it relates to our glass business, that when we bought the business, we inherited some less than profitable contracts. And so we have moved away from some of that revenue intentionally. That is all part of the idea of focusing on really profitable revenue growth.","That comes with a decline in revenue on an organic basis, if you will. And sometimes you need to be willing to walk away from business. And that is what we have done there, if you will. That project and some of those contracts really started at the beginning of this year. So by the time we get into the late Q4, and first quarter, next year we will have fully anniversary that project.","The aviation business, again, you need to keep in mind, which is also by the way, a negative drag on organic growth in both the first and second quarter. That is a business that is very, very lumpy. The average ticket sale there is not necessarily a few hundred dollars for our part, but we are talking tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousand dollars for parts. So timing on a quarter-to-quarter basis can have big impacts. Again, our expectation would be - it's going to be tough sliding there for the rest of the year.","Varun Laroyia","Stephanie this is kind of at the result. I think on your second part, the question about North America margin improvement, it\u2019s actually is very, very tightly linked with what Nick started off by saying our focus on profitable revenue.","Listen, we have talked about this in the past. Also, there are a number of businesses, there is a lot of revenue that is potentially available. And in the past, the company has taken advantage of it. But has been kind of looked into the market pressures, and really in terms of what is the contribution margin for that additional dollar of revenue, whether it be certain customers, whether it be certain product lines. We have consciously walked away from some of that.","How should we say, lower margin or EBITDA free revenue. And yes, we did anticipate the organic growth numbers coming in as a result. And I think the way we would suggest is, Nick mentioned this in his overall comments.","If we look at our core automotive parts and services business, which essentially is full service - and also aftermarket business, that business still grew about 70 basis points year-over-year, despite some tough comps from a year ago. So from that perspective, we are very happy in terms of where the focus by the team has been.","So think about that specific piece, is this being conscious about the revenue that we go chase because there is cost associated with picking up the parts in the warehouse, delivering them in certain cases having to pay for the returns and so just being very conscious in terms of the revenue that we chose.","Operator","Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning guys.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning Bret.","Varun Laroyia","Good Morning.","Bret Jordan","I will go back to Europe. Your peer in the space was commenting about some sequential - improvement around whether driven demand, I guess could if you talk about what you are seeing their sort of - if you are handicapping how much is economic and how much is weather and on the prior question just to add in, are we talking about the Fiat Chrysler battery distribution business as profit with sales.","Dominick Zarcone","So as it relates to Europe as a whole, your question I think really relates to what are we seeing here early in the third quarter and you know we have got basically three weeks worth of data which is not enough to former trend.","Some of our operations are seeing a slight uptick on the revenue side, but again it's three weeks and we are headed into the big holiday season that being the vacation season over in Europe and so we are not going to - we are not working under the assumption if there is going to be significant uptakes in revenue growth in the back half of the year.","We think its though slating, the reality is we talk to our competitors, we talk to our customers, the garages and obviously our suppliers and everyone is I think working under the assumption that these industry conditions are going to with us for a while. If they turn we think we will be a huge beneficiary of that, but we think it prudent to work on the - assumption that it\u2019s going to be - these business conditions are going to be with us for the balance of year.","On the your question as to the battery business. Again, we started that in 2018 as a new programs, so we fully anniversaried that we are continuing to distribute batteries on behalf of the FCA organization that being in the Mopar batteries to their dealers across the United States that is a good relationship and a good contract for us.","Operator","Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks for taking the question.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning.","Chris Bottiglieri","Hey, good morning. Really so we call in September, but I am a patient as our most investors, so want to cut it by layer what you have already told us and trying to think through what we do know already today. So as I understand it, there will be non-GAAP restructuring costs that you have laid out and then there is currently already a 30 basis point headwind from integration systems and that will not be non GAAP.","You would expect 30 basis points to accelerate moving forward as you get further on those projects. And top of that as you go to the planning process there will be more potential cost to recognize these savings. So I guess the question is will those additional cost be non GAAP or those be just the headwind or earnings and how should we begin to think about 2020? I would think this would cause a decrease to European margins and free cash flow, but wanted to kind get anything you do know today would be helpful?","Varun Laroyia","Chris, It's Varun out here. So yes, you are right and just for the broader attendees on the call also Nick did mention that in the second week of September we will provide an update on the various European initiatives that we talked about at the Investor Day last May. So there will be a full, deep dive associated with the various initiatives and really as to how we see the overall three plus year program that we talked about a little over a year.","Your specific question with regards to restructuring, yes. But again, I do want to clarify the $25 million to $30 million of restructuring that we have triggered already. And you would have seen that in the second quarter numbers also. We have actually started that activity so it\u2019s not as if you are starting it now. It actually impacts each of our three reportable segments, not only Europe.","The other piece that I would like to call out is, with regards to the broader European optimization and integration program, the restructuring that we have currently talked about is not the entirety of that piece. So yes, if you play the tape forward, there will be a costs associated with integration.","And really, the point is to kind of give the market some foreshadowing language with regards to transformation costs, right. There will be a cost associated with being able to integrate those businesses. And we will provide an update of that also in the September timeframe.","And again, I think it just is helpful for the investment community to understand, business as usual versus costs associated with taking the business to the next level, and essentially digging the mood that much deeper around what we expect to be best-in-class businesses in any case.","So there will be some costs associated with being able to make those investments, but also to get some of the cost structure that is currently embedded out there. But again, more on that when we get to the September review.","Operator","Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, thanks for filling in.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning.","Varun Laroyia","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Merkel","Good morning. So I have two questions on Europe. So first what percent Europe segment sales, which you defined is more discretionary in nature. And the reason I asked them is trying to get a better understanding of the cyclicality that we might see if the Europe macro stay soft. And then secondly, on the Europe optimization plan, what is the main scope of work for the consultants that you hired? And the reason I ask that is because you are already restructuring and I presume you have already looked at divesting assets. Maybe just a little more clarity there would be helpful.","Dominick Zarcone","Yes, so I will start with the second half of that question, Ryan. It's important to keep in mind that the restructuring activities and what I call the optimization project, they are linked, but they are separate. Restructuring initiatives are all about kind of right sizing our business for the current market conditions. And that involves a consolidation of facilities and the elimination of lower margin activities at a local level as Varun described.","The optimization project in Europe is really a longer term focus. And really, the intent is to gain efficiencies by morphing the European Organization and operating structure from what today is a fairly independent country based model to a slightly more integrated model that leverages a higher level of centralized resources.","To be clear, in Europe we sell into local markets and our focus on customer service needs to remain to be a very activity, so nothing is going to change their, but there are many activities where we can create a better customer experience across the European platform and become more efficient by utilizing a more centralized structure, particularly when you think about things like procurement, category management, logistics IT and alike.","Getting from here to there is no easy task and it\u2019s not going to happen overnight, it\u2019s going to happen over several years, but we believe and some of the initial work with our outside consultants have clearly documented that there could be significant benefits of doing this and that is why we are headed down the path.","There are costs to get there, things like a new ERP program which is going to get kicked off - which was kicked off back in October is going to roll out over the next four to five years. We need to create a central European office as opposed to the virtual structure that we have today.","We need to establish some off shore or near shore back office infrastructure activities and alike, we are in the middle of the process, we are midflight, if you will in identifying and quantifying about the opportunities and expenses to get us there. And that is really we are going to chat about coming September.","So the focus of the program largely is harder shift - kind of the org structure, both from is truly a structure perspective and operating perspective from being a last integrated independent country model to a more integrated central model and that is going to require a lot of heavy lifting to do that, but the benefits we believe are quite significant and at the end of the day it will create a better customer experience, which will help drive revenues and alike.","As it relates to discretionary versus nondiscretionary the reality is most of the parts that we sell in Europe are parts for day-to-day service on your car and in some cases take if your battery is out and you can\u2019t crank your car over right, that is a nondiscretionary item you need to go get a new battery, so your car will work.","but what we find on the margin is when economy gets soft European consumers are no different than American consumers. The first thing you do when things start to get high is you take a hard focus on your household cash flow and you tend to buy down.","And so we are still selling a battery to the shop or maybe instead of the harder battery with the seven year warranty that goes out at a pretty high price point the consumer gets the more value line battery that is cheaper for them. We still sell a battery, but it\u2019s a lower revenue battery and it\u2019s a lower margin dollars batteries.","And so it\u2019s hard to a put number Brian as to what is absolutely discretionary versus nondiscretionary. You know when your oil light comes on to say it\u2019s time to change oil, you don't have to go do that tomorrow and if you are trying to save some money. You may differ that for few months.","You know earlier in the spring I was at a [CAPA] (Ph) conference, CAPA is a big trade organization for the parts manufacturers in Europe, and had an opportunity to meet with the heads of almost all of our major suppliers, a lot of our other peers in the distribution side of the industry and alike.","And our suppliers indicated that they saw their aftermarket activity start to trend down late in 2018. And so we are not even a year into it. So I think we have got - and that is why we are a little bit cautious in the expectations for the back half of the year. I think it's going to be another six months before we begin to kind of lap the impact of the of the soft environment.","Operator","This ends the time allotted for the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dominick Zarcone for final remarks.","Dominick Zarcone","Well we certainly appreciate your time and attention this morning. As I indicated earlier, we are encouraged about the progress that we have made in many regards, particularly the margin structure in North America, the cash flow numbers, which were terrific.","We have a lot of work to do in Europe to understand that and we look forward to sharing with you in mid-September, kind of the update on those activities. So again, I appreciate your time and attention and we will talk to you in September. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference. You may now disconnect.

I will then turn the call over to Michael Clark, who will provide some segment-level financial detail, and then I will come back to comment on our updated guidance and make a few final remarks before taking your questions.","All-in-all, we believe Q2 was a strong quarter for our company and we are pleased with the results. As noted on slide 3, consolidated revenue was $2.458 billion, a 6.7% increase over the $2.3 billion recorded in the second quarter of last year. Total revenue growth from parts and services was 6.4%. Importantly, organic growth in parts and services was 3.8% on a reported basis. After taking into account the fewer selling days in Europe related to the timing of the Easter holiday, organic growth was a solid 4.9% on a same-day basis. It's nice to see the organic growth begin to pick up from the levels we experienced in the first quarter.","Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2017 was $151 million, an increase of 9.5% over the comparable quarter of last year, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.49 as compared to $0.45 for the comparable period of 2016. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.53 compared to $0.52 for the same period last year.","Let's turn to the operating highlights. As you'll note from slide 6, parts and services revenue for our North American segment grew 5.5% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth for parts and services in North America was 2.8%. This reflect a nice uptick from the 1.8% recorded in the first quarter and a touch above our expectations coming into the quarter. There is no doubt that the mild winter weather patterns, which hit us particularly hard in the winter months, carried over into the spring as our body shop customers have limited backlog of work coming into the second quarter.","As witnessed for several quarters now, we continue to grow our parts and services revenue faster than the market as a whole. According to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims on a national basis were up only 1.7% in the second quarter of 2017, following a 1.1% increase in the first quarter. So, our growth of 2.8% in Q2 reflects a 110 basis point outperformance, and gives us confidence that we continue to do the right things to serve our customers.","Importantly, the growth in our core collision product continues to be stronger than the North American average as whole. We also had an excellent quarter in terms of the sale of salvage mechanical parts, and the PGW aftermarket glass business, which we owed for a full year as of April 21, 2017, was a solid contributor to the overall North American organic growth rate during the remainder of the quarter.","The total loss rates continue to increase, reaching 19% at the end of the second quarter. CCC believes this increase is the result of the mix effect and hangover of an older vehicle fleet and a slight uptick in the vehicles one- to three-years old being deemed a total loss. It's important to note that cars in both these age groups are not representative of our collision sweet spot of 3 to 10 years. So despite this slight uptick in the total loss rate, we don't believe that it had a material impact to our current business.","Additionally, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven in the United States were up 1.2% on a nationwide basis in April. But miles driven in the Northeast and South Gulf regions were only up 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. So clearly, we are, again, witnessing significant regional differences in some of our key markets where miles driven are trending below the national average.","During the second quarter, the impact of acquisitions added 2.9% to parts and services growth in North America, with most of that reflecting a few weeks of revenues related to the acquisition of the PGW aftermarket glass business. We lost about 20 basis points of growth due to currencies, primarily related to the Canadian dollar.","We purchased 77,000 vehicles for dismantling at our full-service wholesale operations, a 6.9% increase over the comparable quarter of the prior year. The auctions continue to be healthy and we have access to the vehicles, we believe, we need to continue the growth of our recycling operations. For our North American aftermarket business, we have been expanding both our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.1% and 17.6%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter.","In our self-service business, we acquired $141,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only vehicles, reflecting a 2.2% increase over the second quarter of last year. Our self-serve team has proactively managed the fluctuations in the scrap market by quickly adjusting the cost of goods sold relative to the current market conditions and having an operating culture focused on cost management. Overall, I'm happy with our operating performance of the North American business.","During the quarter, gross margins improved 40 basis points compared to the prior year, in part due to enhanced productivity of our salvage operations, wherein the revenue per car increased at a faster rate than the car cost, reflecting refinements to buying algorithms and an emphasis on inventorying more parts per car and also holding the cars a bit longer.","I'm particularly happy with the ongoing benefits we are experiencing with our productivity initiatives. Although you won't see the same year-over-year improvement in margins because the major benefits from the procurement initiative were first realized about a year ago, we continue to benefit from the ongoing savings which are estimated to be about $9 million on a quarterly basis compared to the base 2015 levels.","With respect to Roadnet, for the month ended June 2017, we were operating at a 97% usage level across our fleet with year-over-year increases of 60% in terms of miles dispatched, 28% for stops dispatched, and 34% for routes dispatched. I'm particularly pleased that we have reduced our missed service windows by 53%, which today stands at less than 1%, another validation of our continued commitment of stellar delivery service to our customers.","Lastly, we integrated three PGW branches into an existing LKQ facility during the first quarter, added another in Q2, and have completed two more early in Q3. We have an additional seven-branch consolidation scheduled for the remainder of the year, which will bring the total consolidations to 13 for 2017, and this will help the cost structure on a going forward basis.","Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total revenue growth of 7.9%. Importantly, organic revenue for parts and services witnessed growth of 4.1% on a reported basis and 7.1% on a same-day basis. Remember, we lost up to two selling days in many European countries due to the Easter holiday falling in Q2 this year compared to the first quarter of last year.","Now that Rhiag has reached its anniversary date and it was included in the results of operations for the full quarter, both this year and last year, we are going to report the growth on a segment basis only, just like North America, as opposed to on a business-by-business basis. What I can tell you is that on a same-day basis, the organic growth of ECP and Sator were above 5%, while Rhiag was in double digits, which we believe are terrific results for all of the entities.","Acquisitions added an additional 10% revenue growth in Europe during the second quarter of 2017, but the weaker currencies, when compared to the 2016 rates, resulted in a 6.2% decline, largely due to the significant year-over-year decline in the pound sterling. The UK team performed extremely well in light of a challenging macroeconomic environment. The stagnant wage growth in the UK, when combined with currency-induced inflation resulting from the Brexit referendum has created a challenging operating environment for our UK business. Despite those challenges, our team remains focused on driving market share and continuously creating a great service experience for our customers.","In particular, our collision offering in the UK provides insurance carriers an attractive value proposition as they face the same dynamics as domestic carriers with increased repair cost and pressure on cycle time. Our Netherlands operation recorded some of the highest same-day growth since we bought the business and is reflective of the ongoing integration of the tuck-in acquisitions we've completed over the past few years. And the double-digit same-day revenue growth at Rhiag is a result of better-than-expected performance in Italy, and a growing, yet very old car park in Eastern Europe, which creates excellent demand for the types of parts we distribute.","During Q2, we opened up a total of 13 new branches in Europe, including one new location in the UK and 12 new locations in Eastern Europe. Over the past 12 months, we have opened 47 new branches in Europe, including seven in the UK and 40 in Eastern Europe.","With respect to Tamworth the warehouse, our T2 project, I am pleased to report that ECP is still on plan with the implementation process and is almost finished with system testing. Product stocking at T2 started the last week of June. And this past Tuesday, we had the very first shipments out of the facility to just a couple of our branch locations. We continue to believe we'll be fully operational at T2 by the end of the year and the project remains on time and on budget.","With respect to Andrew Page, as anticipated during our call last quarter, the UK Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA, has initiated a Phase 2 investigation of our acquisition of this company. We anticipate this review will be completed by year-end. We remain optimistic and believe that the evidence supports that our acquisition of Andrew Page will not lead to any material lessening of competition. But the end decision rests with the CMA and we could be required to divest some or all of the business.","While the CMA investigation is ongoing, we have been required to operate under what is called a hold separate order, which means we are not able to integrate the companies, and ECP and Andrew Page must continue to operate as competitors in the marketplace. As a result, we are very limited as to what we can do to improve the business as we cannot eliminate any of the duplicative expense. We know there are solid synergies and customer benefits available if we can put the companies together, but until we get the requisite clearance, our hands are tied and Andrew Page will continue to be unprofitable.","The overall outlook for our European segment and its strategy remain favorable in terms of our ability to grow both organically and through acquisition. According to statistics included in the European Automobile Manufacturers' report, we currently operate in countries representing about 50% of the European car park, including operations in four of the five fastest-growing car parks. So, we have plenty of runway to grow.","And finally, our Specialty segment continued to perform very well, achieving organic revenue growth of about 5.9% during the second quarter of 2017. Truck and SUV sales, which benefit our Specialty segment, remains very healthy. Additionally, the performance of our Specialty segment was aided by the strength in the RV market, which is benefiting from increased consumer confidence, the retiring of America's workforce, attractive financing options and lower fuel prices.","According to RV industry statistics, in 2016, total RV unit sales reached an all-time high, and related accessories represent key product categories for our Specialty segment. To help support the growth of this segment, we are in the process of adding a new 450,000 square foot Specialty Parts Distribution Center in California that is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2018.","Our corporate development activities have continued in earnest as evidenced by our acquisition of seven businesses during the second quarter. Most of these were smaller companies with a combined annualized revenue of about $68 million. These include a salvage operation in Pennsylvania, a transmission rebuilder in Atlanta to augment the greenfield capacity we are bringing on in Oklahoma City; three small aftermarket distributors acquired by ECP, including another distributor in the Republic of Ireland; one small aftermarket distributor in Italy, and another small automotive paint business in Sweden.","In addition, on July 3, the first business day of the third quarter, Sator closed on the acquisition of four aftermarket distribution businesses in Belgium that will help to solidify our competitive position in that market. And on July 10, Sator acquired a small garage management software company. So, the pace of activity continues to be brisk. We will continue to look for opportunities to grow the breadth and depth of our customer offerings through the addition of successful, well-managed businesses to our family of companies around the globe, and the pipeline of potential transactions is robust.","And now, I will turn the discussion over to Michael Clark, who will run through the details of the segment results.","Michael S. Clark - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone on the call today. While I've been working behind the scenes on our quarterly calls for quite a while, this is my first time speaking to the group, and I'm excited for the opportunity.","Nick touched on a few of the key financial statistics, and I will take you through the more detailed review of the consolidated and segment margins for the quarter. Nick described the trends behind our reported revenue of $2.46 billion, so I'll start with our consolidated gross margin.","As noted on slide 13 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was flat quarter-over-quarter at 39.3%. The result reflects improved margins in North America, mostly on the salvage side, offset by roughly equal decreases in our Europe and Specialty segments. We saw about a 40 basis point increase in our operating expenses, largely due to our Europe segment. We continue to experience negative impact from costs associated with the Andrew Page acquisition. Until we receive clearance from the CMA, we are unable to implement a full integration, which has left us with some cost inefficiencies.","Segment EBITDA totaled $306 million for the second quarter, reflecting a $6 million or 2.1% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. As mentioned, there were fewer selling days in Europe in the second quarter of 2017 compared to last year, which would negatively impact our segment EBITDA dollars this period. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.4%, a 60 basis point decrease over the 13% recorded last year.","During the second quarter of 2017, we experienced a $7 million decrease in restructuring costs compared to the prior year, but a $1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, largely due to recent acquisitions. With that, operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was up about $12 million or roughly 5% when compared to the same period last year.","Interest expense was flat quarter-over-quarter, as we had similar average borrowings and effective interest rates. Non-operating items were favorable by about $5 million compared to last year, as Q2 2017 includes a $3 million gain on bargain purchase, primarily related to adjustments to the Andrew Page net asset values. We pulled this gain out of adjusted income from continuing operations and diluted EPS.","Other non-operating income includes foreign exchange gains and losses and various ancillary income, such as late payment fees. Non-operating income and expenses are difficult to forecast from quarter-to-quarter, so I caution on projecting future periods based on the Q2 results. Pre-tax income during the second quarter of 2017 was $226 million, up $18 million or 8.4% compared to the prior year.","Our net tax rate during the second quarter was 33.6%, down from 33.7% in 2016. The 2017 rate reflected an effective rate of 35.15% and some discrete items that reduced the reported rate, the most significant of which is the excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. The effective rate, excluding discrete items, of 35.15% is 40 basis points higher than Q2 2016 due to an increase in the effective rate for our Europe segment, resulting from tax law changes and a shift in the geographic mix of our European earnings.","Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.49, which was up 8.9% compared to the $0.45 reported last year. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, and other one-time unusual items, was $0.53 in the second quarter of 2017 versus $0.52 last year, reflecting a 2% improvement. Stronger scrap and other metals prices added about $0.01 to EPS in the second quarter of 2017. And as anticipated, the translation impact of currencies had a negative impact of about $0.01 during the quarter.","With the U.S. dollar weakening and having passed the anniversary of the Brexit vote, the translation impact of currency should have a lesser impact on the remainder of the year than what we experienced in the first half of 2017.","And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the second quarter of 2017 increased to $1.207 billion, up 6.1% over 2016. Gross margins in North America during the second quarter were 43.9%, up 40 basis points over the 43.5% reported last year. The strong results reflected the benefits of procurement initiatives in both our salvage and aftermarket operations, partially offset by reductions due to higher customer discounts in our aftermarket business and a decrease in our self-service margin. While scrap steel remained a favorable factor for this business, it was less impactful on the second quarter of 2017 than it was in 2016.","With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost approximately 50 basis points of margin compared to last year. We saw benefit of about 30 basis points from eliminating shared PGW corporate costs after the sale of the OEM business in March. Outside of this benefit, overhead expenses were up 80 basis points, of which about a little less than half came from personnel-related costs. The remainder of increase relates to various individually insignificant items, mostly in selling, general and administrative costs.","In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the second quarter of 2017 was $174 million, a 4.6% increase over last year. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was 14.4% in Q2 of 2017, down 20 basis points from the 14.6% reported in the comparable period of the prior year. While the margin was down slightly in Q2, 14.4% is on the high end of the range of what we've seen in North America over the last five years.","Looking at slide 18, scrap prices were up 9% over the last year and moved about 4% higher in Q2 relative to Q1. As noted previously, the impact of scrap prices was a benefit to Q2 EPS, but was seen mostly in April and had minimal minimum impact in the subsequent months. So assuming prices stay at current levels, we will not get the same level of positive impact during the remainder of the year.","Moving on to our European segment, total revenue in the second quarter accelerated to $890 million from $824 million, an 8% increase. Q2 is the first quarter in which we had a fully comparable period for Rhiag. Thus, the mix impact in gross margin and overhead expenses related to Rhiag that we discussed on prior calls is no longer a factor in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. However, we won't annualize Andrew Page until Q4, so this acquisition continues to have an impact on the comparisons to prior period.","Gross margins in Europe decreased to 37.2% in Q2, a 20 basis point decline over the comparable period of 2016. Gross margins at Rhiag had a 40 basis point negative impact, which is attributable to higher customer rebates, contributing to lower net prices. Our ECP operations had a 20 basis point negative impact due to higher costs related to the new national distribution center, or T2.","Our other European operations, primarily the Sator business, had a net favorable 40 basis point quarter-over-quarter impact. We're emphasizing procurement initiatives across our European organization, including negotiating consolidated rebate and discount programs with suppliers, and we expect the yield benefits late in the year and into 2018.","With respect to operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, we experienced a 140 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis quarter-over-quarter, and 30 basis points sequentially. The factors negatively impacting operating leverage remain similar to the prior quarter: the inclusion of Andrew Page, which is still losing money while we operate under the hold separate order; increased facility costs related to additional branches in the UK; and higher personnel costs in our Sator business.","European segment EBITDA totaled $84 million, a 7% decrease over last year. As shown on slide 21, relative to the second quarter of 2016, the pound declined 11% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA in Europe declined by just 1%.","As a percentage of revenue, European segment EBITDA in the second quarter of 2017 was 9.4% versus 10.9% last year, 150 basis point decline. Approximately 90 basis points of the decline relates to the impact of the Andrew Page and the incremental costs in 2017 related to T2. Having fewer selling days, both relative to the prior-year quarter and sequentially, negatively impacted our leverage on fixed costs compared to both periods.","Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the second quarter totaled $363 million, a 5.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the second quarter decreased 90 basis points compared to last year, largely due to unfavorable product mix with a smaller negative effect from higher warehouse costs capitalized in inventory due to the two new distribution centers added in 2016.","Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were down about 170 basis points as we continue to see the leverage from integrating recent acquisitions into our existing network. We're very pleased with the cost savings we've achieved in this segment over the last year. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $49 million, up 12% from Q2 of 2016, and as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 80 basis points to 13.4%.","Specialty is a highly seasonal business and the second quarter is typically our strongest. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year.","Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 24, you will note that our cash flow from continuing operations during the first half of 2017 was approximately $366 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. Through June 2017, we deployed $184 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $88 million to fund capital expenditures and a net $96 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. The largest capital changes reflect a pay down of $423 million debt, largely funded by the net proceeds derived from the sale of the PGW glass manufacturing business in March.","Going to slide 25, as of June 30, we had about $3 billion of total debt outstanding and approximately $300 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $2.7 billion or 2.5 times last 12-month EBITDA. We have more than $1.4 billion of availability on our line of credit, which together with our cash yields total liquidity of over $1.7 billion.","At this point, I will turn the call back over to Nick to cover the guidance update.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Michael. With respect to our guidance for 2017, we've made some updates based on where we are sitting at the halfway mark of the year. Organic growth for parts and services has been narrowed to 4% at the low end and 5.25% on the high end, reflective of the fact that we're sitting at 4.1% for the first six months. Likewise, we have narrowed the range for our adjusted diluted earnings per share from $1.84 at the low end to $1.92 on the high end, increasing the midpoint to $1.88 per share.","The corresponding adjusted income from continuing operations is $570 million to $595 million, while cash flow from operations has been revised up to $620 million to $650 million. Capital spending has remained constant at the $200 million to $225 million range. The updated guidance reflects an effective tax rate of 35.15% and exchange rates in the back half of the year of $1.30 for the pound sterling, $1.15 for the euro and scrap at $150 per ton.","As it relates to our effort to bring on a new Chief Financial Officer, the response to our search process was terrific and we have had the opportunity to meet with some incredibly talented professionals over the past few months. Whittling down the talent has been hard, but we are in the final phase of the process, and I expect we will have a final decision in the near future.","In summary, Q2 was a solid all-around quarter accentuated by an uptick in organic growth across all of our segments. The overall results reflect the collective efforts of our more than 40,000 employees around the globe, who are working hard to serve our customers each and every day. I would like to thank each of them for their dedication.","Finally, I would like to thank Rob Wagman for his efforts during his 19 years at LKQ. As you know, Rob stepped down on June 1, and is now serving as Executive Advisor with a focus on corporate development activities. Rob's contributions during his tenure were countless, and I look forward to his continued insights as we move forward.","And operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thank you, and good morning, gentlemen.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Jamie.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","And I want to add as well, thanks to Rob, if he's listening, and really have enjoyed working him over the past many years, and wish him the best. If I may, organic growth, North America, first. It seems, when we look at the broader units in operation sort of in this cycle that we're finally getting to a point where you're getting a bigger supply of that sort of three- to four-year-old segment that off-lease vehicle, if you will, as a proxy. I would imagine that that should continue for the remainder of this year and into next year. But wanted to hear from you guys, as you are seeing parts orders coming in and you're serving customers, are you getting a sense that there is growing number of orders for those sort of younger vehicles? And so, even though, compares are easier in the back half that maybe there is an additional tailwind from that units in operation sort of flurry?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Sure. So, a couple of questions you got built in there, Jamie. But all-in-all, we are expecting that the car park and the age of the car park will be a gentle tailwind as we move forward. In our standard information that we provide the investment community, our standard investor relations deck, we include a slide, as you know, that is what we call our collision sweet spot of 3 to 10 years. And for the first time in many years, the number of cars that fall into that age bracket in 2017 is actually ticking up a little bit. Now, it's not significant, so we don't anticipate any major movements here in 2017, but at least it's movement in the right direction, I believe, from about 101 million units to 103 million units.","Then we get another more substantial uptick in 2018 and 2019. So, there is no doubt that we've sold the better part of 52 million vehicles in this country over the \u2013 new vehicles over the last three years, as those vehicles begin to come in to our 3- to 10-year sweet spot, there will be more cars that will need the types of parts that we sell. We do the best we can to track the vintage of parts that we're selling. We haven't seen a material shift, if you will, thus far. But again, we do believe that as the number of cars in a sweet spot grow that that will be a gentle tailwind to our business.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then my last one, if I may ask, on Europe sort of a similar question. I know the business over there is a little different. But can you help us frame kind of where the car park in Europe is within the cycle and how we should think about that? And then a point of clarification, I think I heard you say Rhiag was growing at a double-digit rate. Want to clarify if you were talking organically. And so, as we think about that coming into the organic base for the third quarter, if that's going to be a double-digit contributor and we should take that into account in our models? Thanks.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, with respect to the European organic, again, the business there is differently because we are adding branches, they get closer to the customer base. You have to remember that in the European business, we need to be within 30 to 60 minutes of delivery time between our branches and the customers in order to fulfill their expectations. Part of the way we do that is to add new branch operations to get close to the customer base. That's how we grow actually our market share, if you will. So, some of the growth in Europe comes from, what I'll call, the organic growth of the more mature branches. Some of the growth comes from having just more dots on the map, right. And so Rhiag \u2013 and this is all same day, to make it simple and take the calendar out of the mix, right?","Rhiag was just north of 10%, on a same-day organic basis. About 55% to 60% of that was the contributions for what we would call the more mature stores. And then the balance of it was the impact of those 40 new branches that we've added in Eastern Europe over the last 12 months. If you move back to the ECP, where organic growth was just shy of 6% on a same-day basis, about 85% of that came from the stores that we've had for more than a year and about 0.9% of growth came from those seven new stores that we added over the last 12 months.","The car park in Europe, it's aging a little bit as well, but it's \u2013 you've got a couple different car parks in Europe right. You have Eastern Europe where the average age of a car is still 9.5, maybe 9.6 years old and then you've got Eastern Europe where the average age of car is over 14.5 years old. So there's some very different dynamics based on the geography. But the car park is continuing to grow. It's growing faster in Eastern Europe than it is in Western Europe. That's said, in 2016, the number of auto registrations in the UK hit an all-time high. So, there is a good backdrop for our businesses as we continue to move forward.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Well, thank you so much for that detail. I appreciate. The 55% to 60% of the mature stores in Rhiag, though, can you give us a number in terms of what they're growing at? I know the bend is above 10%...","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, yeah...","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","...in the mature stores?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","So, it's 5.6% to 6%.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Understood. Thank you again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Nick, for taking my questions. Can we dig a little bit into the collision business, and the parts and service numbers in the U.S. versus your relative position? So, if we think of the business as sort of 65%-35% collision versus mechanical, can you give us some flavor on what was happening in that mix given that there is two different sweet spots and collision is getting better, but mechanical probably gets a little worse?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Actually, no real shift, Michael, in our, kind of, if you want to think, product line revenue or growth. I mean, the reality is the core collision product, think about Keystone (41:43) in a box, if you will, the core aftermarket product grew higher than the 2.8% total. Our salvage mechanical parts, engines, transmissions and some of the other big mechanical pieces, right, they were above the 2.8% as well. Again, as has been the case now for several quarters, we do have some product lines that are soft. We talked about this in the past. Aluminum wheels, paint, cooling continue to be soft. But again, there has been no major shift in kind of the relative contribution of salvage versus aftermarket or mechanical versus collision.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, we dug into the sort of a hot items like bumpers, mirrors, doors, they're showing really good trends and that's clearly a sign of, you're still gaining share relative to the market?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. And again, the fact that our organic was at 2.8% and total repairable claims are only up 1.7%, that gives us confidence that we are continuing to, at a minimum, hold our own and likely gaining share...","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Absolutely.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then if I switch gears to Europe, if Andrew Page got closed December 31 and T2 comes on as planned, how do you think about what that margin \u2013 the favorable margin implication of that is in 2018?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Well, so last year, in 2016, Andrew Page hit us for about $0.02 a share. As we've indicated this year, we think it's going to hit us for $0.03 a share. It's going to take some time. Once we get our \u2013 the ability to truly mange Andrew Page, it's not going to be an overnight flip, but ultimately we will be able to rationalize the way we believe all those losses and ultimately get it into a profitable situation. And so, yeah, I'd call, $0.02 to $0.03 of incremental value potentially next year.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, that's just getting to zero, right, I mean, as opposed to \u2013 take it from a loss of zero is $0.03?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Correct. Now, we anticipate we're going to be able to get it into profitability. But again, that doesn't happen overnight, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Got it. The leverage is greater than $0.03, because you'd start working towards your overall margins, which are prior to this sort of $0.10, $0.11. So that's, if I go from whatever the negative is, equated to $0.03 multi \u2013 three, five years plan, I head towards $0.11. That's what I'm playing with.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, the key is going to be, we're \u2013 we continue to be optimistic, we continue to feel strongly in our perspectives. At the end of the day, it's how many of the branches that we've acquired are we going to be able to keep.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Does your case get made stronger, because of Uni-Select's Parts Alliance acquisition, now that there is a well-capitalized bigger player, owns the 160 branches?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Probably not, because the competitors on the street corner are still the same competitors on the street corner. They're just owned by somebody else.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then I presume that the Benelux transactions are key component from going from three to two-step and how quickly can that happen?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, just as we did in the Netherlands, where we brought some of the larger distributors that we were selling to, we brought some of our larger customers, the flip from three-step to two-step, that's really what the acquisition of the four businesses in Belgium were all about. They have a good market share and that will allow us basically to get to the last mile for the garage which is what \u2013 we were missing that.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And that integration to make that switch now that they're owned is relatively immediate, I mean, like within 90 days?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, again, nothing happens quite that fast, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, yeah.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","But over the next year, just like over the last year, as we've integrated the Netherlands tuck-in acquisitions, over a year, you begin to move it a little bit and, ultimately, it'll look like the one big seamless enterprise in Belgium.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. And then last question for me on opportunities to further consolidate market. So, you're not in Germany, France, Spain. There's big family businesses in Germany. There's two big businesses owned by private equity in France and lots of little companies in Spain. It appears that the bigger companies in France and Germany are being acquisitive too. So, couple of questions on this front. Are they being rational when they're being acquisitive and valuations are staying within reasonable ranges? And two, what's your opportunity, if they're showing a \u2013 they're being acquisitive, what's what your opportunity to penetrate those markets?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, again, we haven't bumped up against the big French companies in acquisitions kind of head-to-head, so I can't comment directly as to whether they're being rational or not. They're good companies, they're solid companies, they've got good capital structures, right. Whether they decide to sell is going to be up to their private equity owners. With respect to some of the other countries, Germany, Spain, if you will, we believe that given our presence in the marketplace, we will have an opportunity to at least look at those businesses if and when they come to market. And we think that with our base of operations, we have as much, if not more, ability to create synergies than anyone else in Europe. But we have to wait. Again, we can't force somebody to come to market.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about the UK collision business gaining some traction as a cost saving initiative. Could you tell us what we are doing in collision revenues and maybe the growth rate over there?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, the collision business, relative to the ECP is still relatively small, right? It's running somewhere on the order of \u00a350 million, \u00a360 million. But it's growing nicely. Collision in the UK, I think, was up about 10% in Q2 over Q2 of last year. So, still outperformance from a growth perspective. The key there is, ultimately, the insurance companies in Europe are no different than the insurance companies in the U.S. And they've got the same pressure to try and get claims costs down. And part of the way they do that is through parts, and part of the way they do that is through cycle time. I mean, we have, as you know, ongoing pilots and programs with 18 of the larger insurance companies over in the UK, and a couple of them have told us that, as a result of our ability to get them parts and get them parts quickly, they're seeing their cycle times begin to move down.","So, we think that, ultimately, that bodes well for our ability to create an ever meaningful business in collision parts over \u2013 not just in the UK where we are today, but ultimately to bring that on to Continent as well.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then in the U.S., obviously, Specialty was a pretty solid and it looks like Stag and Coast deal have worked well on the RV side. Would you give us the mix of RV versus vehicle performance parts within Specialty?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","We don't disclose that, Bret. But if you backed into kind of what Coast was almost exclusively RV, and Stag was exclusively RV. So, you're \u2013 probably a little bit north of a third.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, in a collision publication, not too long ago, there was mentioned that maybe you're getting into some distribution of OE parts, with Fiat Chrysler as a partner. Could you comment on that initiative at all?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","We don't comment on any particular customer and the like, because of agreements that we have with some of our customers, at all. But the reality is, is we're always looking to expand our distribution of parts. I think there is a lot of folks in the marketplace who recognize the power that we have as being the largest distributor of collision-related parts in North America and that there is opportunities for them to leverage our distribution background.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So you are doing some OE parts, I guess, is the answer?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","We are.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And I guess one last question, I shouldn't even bother to ask the State Farm question, but anything going on with State Farm?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","No new news.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, thank you, Bret.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good afternoon. Good morning. Michael, nice to hear you on the call as well. I wanted to follow up on a prior question, regarding T2 and sort of the redundant costs you're facing in 2017 and how that might look in 2018 when those redundant costs roll off?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Craig, this is Nick. Good morning. As we've stated now going back to the mid 2015, right, we are incurring costs at T2 even though \u2013 well, at least up until last Tuesday hadn't shipped a single product out of the facility because we've been paying rent and we're paying utilities, we're staffing up with labor and the like. And in the meantime, we're keeping the other two facilities that will ultimately get shut down, they're running full bore. So we're still paying the rents and the utilities and the labor and everything else there.","Ultimately, once we know that T2 is operating exactly as it needs to be and there is little to no risk of any fulfillment issues as it relates to keeping our 200 plus branches stock full on a daily basis, we will shut down two of other facilities. And so, we will save the rent and the labor and the like. We quantified that the impact of T2 was $0.03 last year, another $0.02 this year, so $0.05 in total. We won't begin to rationalize the other two facilities until 2018. So, we won't get the entire nickel back next year, but we will get, we believe, some good portion of that back. And then by 2019, there should be the rest of the positive benefits.","Michael S. Clark - LKQ Corp.","Craig, this is Michael. Just of note, the impact of T2 is transitioning from below gross margin to above gross margin as we move it into operation. So, you start to see the impact more on the gross margin than just on EBITDA.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. And then with respect to Europe, I'm guessing that some of your competitors there think of LKQ as their potential exit strategy given your M&A strategy. But I wonder to what extent you've got the scale necessary to attack some of those markets organically, at least where you have nearby operations?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Probably, we can go both ways. I mean if you think about what we've done with Rhiag, okay, we bought a really big business, and yet we've added more than 40 additional branches, which is a program that we brought to the table more than what they were doing on their own. I always believe that it's not just what you buy that's important, but what you do with what you buy, that's really important, and the ability to add branches is critical. We can go into some of those other locations and try and greenfield, if you will, and just add branches. Part of it is, though \u2013 creating a presence is hard and that would be a long road. So, it'd probably be a combination, Craig, of both acquired entities to get a base and then to continue to build the branch network, which we can do on our own once we have a base.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. And then last question from me, just in terms of North American organic growth, what is embedded in your forecast for 2018?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, if you take a look at \u2013 we narrowed the range based on where we are. The reality is, at the low end of the range, at 4%, if North American organic isn't around where it was in Q2, that will cover us for the low-end. At the high end, North American organic would probably need to move close to 4% in the back half of the year. So, longer looking, we would anticipate that North American organic, obviously, would continue to move up, particularly if we get any sort of normal winter weather pattern in 2018.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, that helps. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","If I could follow up on the North American organic growth side, recognizing that you have one less selling day in 3Q, you saw a nice sequential acceleration from 1Q to 2Q. Is it your expectation that growth should be similar to 2Q on a headline basis, or is there the potential for sequential further acceleration on headline front (57:06)?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Let's talk on a same-day basis, because that takes the calendar out of the mix.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","On a same-day basis, we think that Q2 kind of serves as a baseline. We're cognizant of the fact that as we move though the back half of the year, we get slightly easier comps, because as you recall, the organic growth comps in the back half last year were still coming in. So, I would say, a baseline that's slightly moving north in the back half of the year from a North American organic perspective.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, similarly, in 2Q, is there any color you could provide around cadence within the quarter as well as geographic disparities in performance? I know you touched on that in prior quarters that there was quite a bit of geographic disparity.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, the Northeast and the kind of the Midwest, which are kind of key winter states, continue to be a little bit behind the curve on a relative basis to the overall LKQ footprint as a central region, and the West continue to be a bit stronger. Again, people got to remember, this is a big country. And what happens in the Northeast could be completely different than what's going on in the Southwest, right. And from a cadence perspective, we don't disclose results, Ben, as you know, but we're comfortable with where we're headed into Q3.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","That's great. And then just one last one for me, as it relates to your M&A strategy. You've steadily reduced leverage on the balance sheet as we've moved into the year. How much more do you think you need to delever the balance sheet before you feel comfortable making a major acquisition if the opportunity arises?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","If the opportunity arises, we're ready to go today.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Great.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","The reality is, is we're going to pay off or continue to pay down our debt, because we generate a lot of cash. And it's not a question of waiting to do an acquisition to get our \u2013 because we want to get our leverage down, it's really waiting for those acquisitions to come to market. We don't control the timing there.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Understood. Thanks, and good luck.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Hi, Nick. Just on...","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Samik.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. Just on the North America segment, just wanted to get your thoughts. I know the aftermarket here has been a bit more challenging than years past, but do you see an opportunity to maybe accelerate some of the cost optimization plans you had for maybe like \u2013 initially scheduled for next year and excluding those to sort of pull ahead the earnings growth, is there some plans regarding that?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, the reality is we're trying to continue to grow and optimize all of our businesses, whether it's on the salvage side or on the aftermarket side. Again, the core products on the collision space are actually performing quite well. As Michael indicated in his comments, the margins \u2013 gross margins in aftermarket were down just a tad. And part of that, quite frankly, has to do with \u2013 bigger customers get bigger discounts, and as the MSOs continue to get larger and larger and create a bigger piece of the pie, that's actually good for us, because they use a lot of the parts that we sell.","On the operating side, again, we're trying to do the best we can to optimize our overall cost and whether it's things like the procurement initiatives, which were largely through Roadnet, which is \u2013 as I indicated in my comments, we think will continue to add benefits. Again Roadnet, it's not salvage versus aftermarket, it's our total parts, North America, but we will be able to get leverage there.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Got it.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Is that helpful?","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah. Defiantly. And just thinking about Europe and how much of headroom you have there still in terms of store expansions. I know on slide 19, you sort of specify what your store count is for ECP and Rhiag, and that's grown considerably since last year. How should we think about sort of what the long-term target would be for store count for like ECP and Rhiag, just to get a sense of how much growth is left just in terms of store expansion?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, the ECP question, Samik, is really going to depend on where we end up with Andrew Page and how many of those 106 branches that we've acquired we'll be able to keep, because assuming if we are able to keep most, all those, the need then to add incremental branches to be able to get closer to the customers goes down a bit. In Eastern Europe, where we've added those (1:02:55) branches over the last 12 months, we are in the early days there. That's a market where the car park is growing, the age of the cars is really old and so we sell \u2013 the demand for the types of parts we sell is really high. The organic growth there, we think, is going to be good for years to come and there's the ability to add, call it, 10 to 12 branches a quarter for a long time.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And just finally, clarification, I know in the Specialty segment, you mentioned a negative mix this quarter. Can you just provide some more details on what was that?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Could you ask that again?","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The negative mix in the Specialty segment which impacted gross margin this quarter, I believe that was part of the prepared remarks.","Michael S. Clark - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, there's a negative mix related to the sales channels we use, a little bit more on the drop ship side which has lower margins.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Great. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We do appreciate the time that you spent with us.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Joseph Boutross","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.","Dominick Zarcone","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour. This morning, I will provide some high level comments related to our operations in the first quarter, and then Varun will dig into the segments and related financial details, before I come back with a few closing remarks.","Taken as a whole, Q1 represented a solid quarter and played out pretty much as we anticipated. We made good progress with the various operational and productivity initiatives we began implementing in 2018 and the business performed in line with our expectations knowing that we faced exceptionally tough growth comparisons for North America, a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, and significant negative headwinds from the year-over-year impact of scrap and FX.","Now on to the quarter. As noted on Slide 4, revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $3.1 billion, a 14% increase over the $2.7 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2018. Parts and services organic growth for the first quarter of 2019 was essentially flat year-over-year on a reported basis, but when adjusting for one less selling day in the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was 1.3%.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ's stockholders for the first quarter of 2019 was $0.31 as compared to $0.49 for the same period of 2018. However, the first quarter of 2019 results include $52 million of noncash impairment charges net of tax composed of $40 million related to the company's equity investment in Mekonomen and a $12 million charge for net assets held-for-sale. These impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2019 by $0.17 a share.","So on an adjusted basis, net income attributable to LKQ stockholders was $176 million, an increase of 4% as compared to the $170 million for the same period of 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter of 2019 was $0.56 as compared to $0.55 for the same period last year.","Let me briefly touch on the impairment of net assets held-for-sale, which Varun will cover in more detail during his remarks. As you are all aware, we\u2019ve on several occasions discussed our four key strategic pillars, which include: growing our customer offering, expanding our geographic footprint, adapting to changing technologies and rationalizing the asset base.","With respect to the latter, I view the efforts to rationalize the business as an ongoing evaluation of our assets to ensure that we have the right combination of operations for our long-term success. As you might expect, undertaking this evaluation will from time-to-time identified businesses that no longer represent a strong fit with either our long-term strategy or financial return objectives.","After careful consideration, we reached a conclusion to sell a few of our operations in the upcoming year. While each of the subject businesses has its strengths, we don't view them as being critical to our core operations. These businesses neither individually nor collectively reflect a significant amount of revenue or EBITDA. The sale of these non-core assets will, however, help improve our overall margins and simplify our operating model.","With respect to capital allocation during the first quarter of 2019, the company repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average price per share of $26.66. Since initiating our buyback plan in late October of last year, we have repurchased 4.9 million shares reflecting a $130 million return of capital to our shareholders.","Let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7, organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment declined 1.4% in the first quarter of 2019, but was up slightly when adjusting for the one less selling day. As anticipated, the PGW glass business and the airplane recycling operation exhibited negative same day organic growth. While the largest part of our North American segment, the Automotive Salvage and Aftermarket Parts operations exhibited same day revenue growth of approximately 1.8%.","Importantly, organic growth in North America ended on a strong note with the March organic revenue growth showing significant improvement from the levels posted in January and February. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims were down 2.6% year-over-year in the first quarter.","We continue to believe this outperformance in our growth relative to the CCC data is due to the increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spots, that being model years 3 to 10 years old and auto insurance carriers ongoing efforts to reduce the cost pressures associated with increased cycle time and labor due to shortage of technicians.","Despite some challenges on the top line, including facing a tough comparison from Q1 of 2018, our focus on profitable growth help drive year-over-year margin improvements in North America with segment gross margins and EBITDA margins improving 90 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively, when compared to the first quarter of 2018.","Removing the self service business which was impacted the most by the decline in scrap prices, gross margins and EBITDA margins for the rest of our North American segment were up 170 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. Varun will address this in more detail, but I wanted to highlight that our margin enhancement efforts are indeed working.","We also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision SKU offerings and the total number of certified parts available growing 5.8% and 11.6% respectively year-over-year in the first quarter. Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 39%, primarily driven by the acquisition of STAHLGRUBER.","Organic revenue growth for parts and services in the first quarter of 2019 in Europe was 1.3% on a reported basis and 2.1% on a same day basis, which was above our expectations given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds facing Europe. Importantly, each of our European platforms witnessed positive organic revenue growth for parts and services on both a reported and same day basis in the first quarter.","Europe has seen many of its economy slowing as evidenced by lower new vehicle sales and lower or negative GDP growth. Discussions with our suppliers and other industry participants have confirmed the negative impact, the poor economic growth is having on the European marketplace. Our sense is that the economic conditions have led to an initial deferral of repairs and maintenance. While a near-term headwind, we believe that core automotive maintenance can only be deferred so long and the demand will eventually rebound.","Our U.K operation continues to make good progress despite the fact that the market continues to struggle with the uncertainty around Brexit, which continues to undergo negotiations with a new deadline of October 31. That has been widely reported in the media Brexit is having a negative impact on overall consumer demand in the United Kingdom. With respect to the automotive parts space, most market participants are again reporting low single-digit to negative organic revenue growth rates.","Despite the softness in the market ECP performed well by delivering meaningful improvements in both organic revenue growth for parts and services and EBITDA margins on a year-over-year basis. The team at ECP continues to make progress with the ongoing optimization of our T2 distribution facility. Yet there's still more room for an improvement and I am confident we are now have the right team in place to position and optimize the long-term performance of our U.K business.","Additionally, ECP's collision business performed above expectations and above the European segment as a whole. We continue to believe ECP's aftermarket collision parts and paints offerings offer an attractive value proposition to U.K auto insurance carriers as they confront profitability challenges. According to the Association of British Insurers, U.K carriers have witnessed pressures similar to the domestic carriers with increased parts cost, vehicle complexity, and increased cycle times.","In 2017 and 2018, claims cost reached record highs in the U.K. Unfortunately the positive improvements experienced at ECP were largely offset by the mix impact related to the inclusion of STAHLGRUBER and the Q1 2019 results and soft margins relative to the prior year elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Italy and Belgium. At STAHLGRUBER we are on track with our projected synergies.","We've also begun some testing with respect to utilizing Sulzbach-Rosenberg, our state-of-the-art national distribution center in southern Germany to support the Rhiag operations in Central and Eastern Europe. We have also begun to expand the utilization of private-label products into STAHLGRUBER's product offering. Finally, during Q1, we opened two branches in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe we opened five new branches, while closing three underperforming locations.","Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the first quarter, Specialty reported total revenue growth of 0.5% with organic revenue growth for parts and services of 1% being offset by a negative impact from currencies. Adjusting for one less selling day in the quarter, Specialty had organic revenue growth of 2.6%. During the first quarter, our Specialty team hosted their industry leading tradeshows, including the RV Expo in Nashville and the Automotive Focus Big Show in Dallas with both events witnessing solid year-over-year increases in supplier and customer attendance as well as show orders. The Expos training and education programs continue to be a strong draw as witnessed by the largest attendance ever at the Expos RV University.","Moving on to corporate development. On April 1, after the close of the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of Elite Electronics. This transaction is directly aligned with our strategic pillars of growing our customer offering and adapting to new technologies. We have been signaling for some time now that select service offerings could be an excellent complement to our North American parts business.","Elite's mobile and on-site technical solutions are provided to automotive collision and mechanical repair facilities that are facing the rapidly expanding requirements related to vehicle diagnostics and calibration. Elite services include reflashing, programming. pre and post collision repair diagnostics, ADAS related calibrations, airbag replacements, theft and vandalism repair and frame replacements.","The robust service offering assist LKQ and Elite's customers in completing time-consuming and challenging repairs. Allowing a lead to handle any number of these operations, improved cycle times and reduces associated repair expenses thereby resulting in better customer experiences. We are delighted to have the Elite team join LKQ and we look forward to adding additional service focused businesses to our suite of customer offerings. We will continue to complete tuck-in acquisitions and during the first quarter we closed on two small transactions in Europe.","And with that, I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2019 guidance.","A - Varun Laroyia","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter, cover our current liquidity position and discuss our 2019 guidance before turning it back to Nick for closing remarks.","As we have discussed on the past few calls, we are focused on delivering profitable growth, expanding on margins, generating free cash flow and optimizing our capital allocation strategy. The first quarter provided evidence of continued progress on these initiatives as we grew our consolidated gross margin by 30 basis points over the prior year, produced $124 million in free cash flow, paid down $60 million of debt, and as Nick mentioned, repurchase $70 million in LKQ stock while maintaining our net leverage ratio.","While we're pleased with the progress on our initiatives, we still have work to do on our segment margins. And I will comment on these drivers behind the quarter-over-quarter variances in a few minutes.","Diluted EPS attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter was $0.31, down $0.18 relative to the comparable quarter last year, primarily related to a few impairment charges on which I will provide further details. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, acquisition and divestiture related gains and losses, impairment charges and the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation was $0.56, reflecting a 2% improvement over the comparable quarter last year.","I want to highlight a few items that affected quarter-over-quarter comparability. First, scrap prices trended down in the first quarter of 2019 with a sequential decrease of 9%. Whereas the opposite was true in the first quarter of 2018 when scrap prices rose 21%, sequentially. We benefited by roughly $0.03 in the first quarter a year-ago due to the price rise of scrap compared to a negative impact of about a penny in Q1 2019, resulting in a $0.04 negative swing year-over-year.","Second, the U.S dollar was stronger in Q1 2019 relative to the prior year, which created a negative impact from translation and transaction gains and losses of almost a penny and a half. Taken together, scrap prices and currency impacts represented about a $0.05 headwind relative to Q1 of 2018.","As we disclosed during the fourth quarter call, the Mekonomen stock price declined significantly between the 1st -- 31st of December and February 28. We indicated that without a recovery in the stock price by quarter end that we would need to record a further impairment. Unfortunately, there was no rebound and we have booked a $40 million impairment charge for the quarter in the equity earnings line of our income statement. The Mekonomen share price appears to have stabilized in recent weeks, so we are hopeful that the significant impairment charges are behind us.","As we continue to refine our capital allocation strategy and to simplify the operating model, we have undertaken a review of our businesses to identify underperforming assets. We identified several businesses that we intent to sell over the course of the next year. These units which represent approximately $170 million in annualized revenue and a nominal amount of EBITDA outside of our core business and all geographies.","Under the accounting rules, we are required to classify these assets as held-for-sale on the balance sheet because of our intention to sell the businesses in the near-term. Additionally, we have to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets as of quarter end. We concluded that the expected recovery would be less than the carrying value and as a result we recorded a $15 million impairment charge, which is excluded from our calculation of adjusted diluted EPS.","Other than the impairment charge, there is no impact on the income statement presentation for these businesses. That is the revenue and expenses flow through the same lines as before the held-for-sale classification and will continue to be presented as such until the sale is completed. Given the ongoing negotiations related to the potential transactions, we know you will appreciate the need for confidentiality and why we are unable to provide further details currently. We will of course provide updates on subsequent calls. On a combined basis, the Mekonomen and the assets held-for-sale impairment charges reduced our GAAP diluted EPS by $0.17.","Now I will turn to Slides 11 and 12 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated results. The consolidated gross margin percentage increased 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 39% with meaningful gains in both our North America and European segments. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, there is a negative mix impact as the lower gross margin European segment makes up a larger percentage of the consolidated results, and hence have a dilutive effect on the consolidated margin.","Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily attributable to the North America and European segments, which I will discuss a bit later. Interest expense was up $8 million or 27% compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to higher average debt balances, primarily related to the STAHLGRUBER financing in April 2018.","Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.1% for the quarter, which is roughly in line with our full-year estimate. I've already mentioned the Mekonomen impairment in the equity earnings line, but I also want to point out that the reported fourth quarter 2018 Mekonomen earnings declined relative to the prior year. Therefore, our share of their earnings, which we pick up in our first quarter reporting was down relative to the prior year by about $2 million after-tax.","Moving to the segments. While North America -- on Slide 14, gross margin during the first quarter was 44.2% or 90 basis points higher than last year. Our aftermarket team continues to do really strong work on pricing initiatives to offset the general wage inflation and higher logistics costs prevalent in the U.S market. While aftermarket is the primary driver of the segment improvement, we are also encouraged by progress on margin in our glass product line as a result of pricing initiatives and renegotiating underperforming contracts. There was a partial offset of our self-service operations gross margin, which decreased relative to the first quarter of 2018 due to the scrap price impact that I referenced and Nick called out the impact in his comments earlier.","Shifting to operating expenses, we saw an increase of 100 basis points compared to a year-ago. The negative leverage effect resulting from quarter-over-quarter decline in revenue of $28 million drove a significant portion of the decrease. Having one fewer selling day in Q1 of 2019 increased the expense as a percentage of revenue of fixed costs, such as facility rental expenses and administrative personnel salaries. Additionally, the decline in other revenue primarily related to lower scrap prices created a negative leverage effect as highest scrap revenue doesn't require additional overhead costs such as commissions and delivery costs.","That said, this segment did incur higher expenses in rent related to expansions and renewals, employee benefit costs due to enhancements implemented across the U.S business last April and vehicle insurance costs. In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the first quarter of 2019 was $177 million, down $1 million compared to a year-ago and as a percentage of revenue was up 20 basis points from the prior year quarter.","Sequential changes in scrap prices had an unfavorable impact of $4 million for the quarter compared to a positive impact of $13 million in Q1 2018 creating a $17 million year-over-year negative swing. On the surface, a 20 basis point improvement in segment EBITDA may not sound very impressive, but when you factor in the gross margin increase and the scrap price and leverage headwinds, the North America team took a solid step towards achieving its margin goals.","Moving to our European segment on Slide 16. Gross margin in Europe was 36.8% in Q1, a 90 basis point increase over the comparable period of 2018. Our centralized procurement yielded a 50 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs as we continue to benefit from the synergies created with the STAHLGRUBER acquisition. Our U.K operations contributed a 30 basis point increase with lower distribution costs. You recall that we had some challenges in our T2 facility in early 2018, which produced an incremental operating costs that did repeat this year.","With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 60 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year-ago relative to lower sales growth partially attributable to fewer selling days in the quarter had a negative impact on operating leverage, given the segments relatively high fixed cost base especially with regards to personnel. Partially offsetting, we had a 40 basis point decrease primarily due to freight and also facility rental expenses.","European segment EBITDA totaled $105 million, a 39% increase over last year. As shown on Slide 17 relative to the first quarter of a year-ago, both the sterling and the euro weakened by 6% and 8%, respectively, against the dollar causing almost a penny and a half negative effect from translation and transaction gains and losses on adjusted EPS in the quarter.","Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% for Q1 2019, flat compared to the same period last year. Compared to a year-ago, we made progress towards integrating STAHLGRUBER and putting T2 back on track. However, with challenging economic conditions and fewer selling days, negative the effecting revenue in Q1, we are working actively to manage operating leverage.","Turning to our Specialty segment on Slide 18, the gross margin percentage declined 160 basis points in Q1 relative to the comparable period a year-ago. Of this amount, 120 basis points related to higher net product costs as a supplier discounts will lower than realized in the prior year. We benefited from higher discounts in the fourth quarter of 2017 that carried over into our first quarter 2018 gross margin. The balance related primarily to increased customer incentives due to higher volumes with certain customers.","Operating expenses improved 50 basis points relative to the prior year with reductions in personnel and advertising more than offsetting higher facility expenses related to warehouse expansion projects that went live after the first quarter of 2018. While these projects generated an increase in year-over-year expenses, we believe that the investments were necessary to support the segments growth and profitability objectives and that the short-term margin effect will be mitigated as the warehouses are optimized.","Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $38 million, down about 10% from Q1 of 2018 and as a percentage of revenue EBITDA margin was down 120 basis points to 10.7%. Our Specialty business has produced solid results in recent years and we believe that the Specialty team will be able to make up the shortfall and produce growth in both EBITDA dollars and margin percentage for the full-year.","Let's move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 19, you will note that our operating cash flow for the first quarter was $177 million, 22% higher than Q1a year-ago. With the change to our compensation plan, our teams are focused on driving working capital improvements, though I do need to call out that there will be some ups and downs as we move throughout the year based on seasonality and timing of certain transactions. For example, in our STAHLGRUBER operation customer rebates get paid in the month of March, which triggered a large outflow in receivables for the quarter that wasn't present a year-ago. On the other hand, we were able to reduce inventory by $72 million and that resulted as a cash inflow for the quarter.","CapEx for the quarter was $53 million resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of $124 million and almost 50% improvement relative to year-ago. In addition to share repurchases of $70 million in the first quarter, we paid down $60 million of debt. Our strong cash flow generation allows us to delever while at the same time returning capital to our shareholders.","On January 1, 2019, the long-awaited lease accounting standard ASC 842 went into effect. And you can see a large impact on our balance sheet. We added about $1.3 billion in assets and a similar amount in liabilities related to operating leases that were off balance sheet under the prior accounting rules. There was no material impact on our income statement due to the new accounting standard and our net leverage ratio covenant under the credit facility was unaffected.","Moving to Slide 21. As of 31st of March, we had $360 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $3.9 billion or about 2.9x last 12 months EBITDA.","Now I would like to provide an update on our annual guidance. Please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels. Additionally, the guidance continues to assume no material disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union. As Nick noted earlier, the first quarter came in line with our expectations.","North America excluding self-service performed well and we expect the specialty margin decline to be short-lived. While we see challenges with European economic conditions holding for the remainder of the year, we believe that the business is resilient and that the management team will adapt appropriately to meet the targets. Therefore, we are leaving our 2019 full-year guidance unchanged with the exception of our full-year forecasted U.S GAAP income going to the first quarter activity.","Let me run you through the guidance figures quickly. Organic parts and services revenue growth remains at 2% to the 4% corridor. Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis is updated to a range of $1.87- to $2 accounting for the Q1 activity, primarily related to the non-cash impairment charges I referenced earlier. Adjusted diluted EPS remains unchanged for the year. The range remains at $2.34 to $2.46.","Cash flows from operations continues to reflect a range of $775 million to $850 million. And capital spending is unchanged at a range of $250 million to $300 million. In summary, the first quarter was a solid start to the year and we remain optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year.","Now I'll turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks.","A - Dominick Zarcone","Thank you, Varun for that financial overview. And with that, let me reiterate the key initiatives discussed in February that we will continue to focus on during the balance of 2019. First, we will integrate and simplify the operating model. Our management teams will concentrate on leveraging the strengths of their respective business units for profitable revenue growth, margin improvement and cash conversion, and as discussed, work on divesting the businesses that don't represent the right long-term fit for our organization. Second, we will closely monitor costs and react quicker to changing market conditions. We believe that we can adapt to market trends and economic conditions to deliver our full-year targets.","Third, we will invest in our future through projects like the European ERP implementation, which continues to move forward. And finally, we will create even tighter alignment with the key priorities of the company and the expectations of our stockholders through revised compensation programs. I am happy to report these programs and targets have been communicated throughout the organization and the teams are actively working towards achieving their respective goals.","In closing, I am very proud of the momentum we\u2019ve created with our Q1 performance and how our team of over 51,000 employees performed amid various operating challenges in both North America and Europe. Importantly, I want to recognize how our leaders across each of our segments have embraced our productivity initiatives and the metrics we have implemented as we progress through 2019 and beyond. These factors should continue to create long-term value for our stockholders.","And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open. Michael Hoffman, your line is open. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Benjamin from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Stephanie Benjamin","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on expectations for European EBITDA margin for the remainder of the year flat for the first quarter, but what kind of are the drivers to see improvement as we move through the year? Thanks.","Varun Laroyia","Stephanie, good morning. It's Varun Laroyia. How are you?","Stephanie Benjamin","Doing well. Thank you.","Varun Laroyia","So listen, in terms of -- excellent. Listen, so in terms of our European margins, while we were really pleased with the way our ECP and our U.K operations bounced back. As Nick noted in his opening comments, there was some macroeconomic softness, which obviously pull down the overall organic growth numbers. But in terms of the overall full-year number for our European business, while clearly, Q1 was a little disappointing from an operating leverage standpoint. We do know that in the remaining nine months, the team is actively working towards delivering on their targets. That is again a fair bit of the year yet to run and the team is actually proactively working through a series of different initiatives to ensure that they hit their margin targets. I think if you\u2019re referring back to the broader 3-year program that we had called out following January 2018, so that full-year 2021 we would hit the 10 points of segment EBITDA margins, that remains unchanged. So no change to that program that we had called out for the 36 month period.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Hey, good morning, guys.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan","Could you talk about the accounts payable balance? Maybe as its specifically around the European side of the business? How you\u2019ve done as far as leveraging payables? And then sort of -- along with that as STAHLGRUBER enter the mix, could you give us some feeling for STAHLGRUBER's accretion maybe in Q1 what it added? You talked about some incremental margin and the purchasing mix, that maybe you could talk about it sort of standalone profitability?","Varun Laroyia","Yes. Hey, Bret. Good morning. It's Varun. Let me answer the first part of your question and then I think Nick will pick up on the second part of your two-part question. So in terms of payables on an enterprise-wide basis, they were flat on a year-over-year basis. But you are indeed correct, in terms of being able to get a vendor financing program up and running, we've had great discussions and we continue to work towards getting it across the final finishing line. So we\u2019re excited about that, but we do believe that really is where there is a significant amount of upside. For no other reason than it is a common set of suppliers, that also supply to the big box folks here in the U.S. So again, discussions are underway. We have great financing partners lined up also and we actually anticipate seeing some of that come through in 2019.","Dominick Zarcone","And Bret this is Nick. Good morning. As it relates to the STAHLGRUBER accretion, indeed that acquisition added to our earnings per share. On a direct basis, it is a few cents, as we\u2019ve noted in other conversations, not all of the synergies related to STAHLGRUBER will [indiscernible] themselves at STAHLGRUBER, because some of the procurement, really that\u2019s some of those [indiscernible] gets spread overall the different operating units in Europe. So we are happy with the acquisition and how its performing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Kennison","Varun, first if you could -- good morning. Varun, if you could give us the per day organic growth for each segment? I am sorry, I missed it. And then with respect to Specialty, maybe just add a little color to what happened in the first quarter and what makes you confident that business will recover as the year unfolds? Thanks.","Varun Laroyia","Yes. Hey, Craig. Good morning. It's Varun. So in terms of on a per day basis for each of our reportable segments. As Nick mentioned, North America was marginally up about 10 basis points on a per day basis. Europe was up 2.1% on a per day basis and Specialty achieved organic revenue growth of 2.6% on a per day basis. The key out here really is, if you think about some of our businesses that Nick also called out and I also refer too, in terms of whether it would be our glass business where we\u2019ve focused on margins, that\u2019s certainly pulled us back in terms of overall per day on a -- in North America, for example. And again as Nick mentioned, if we were to pull up the glass and the airplane recycling business, as they both exhibited a negative same day growth. The largest part of our North American segment, being salvage and the aftermarket piece, essentially grew about 1.8% on a per day basis. So just wanted to kind of reiterate that\u2019s a solid performance across each of our large business segments. And with regards to the second part of your question on Specialty, so yes, Specialty gross margins were down 160 basis points, but about a 120 basis points of that's almost three quarters of that related to and this is -- I\u2019m going to ask folks to dive into their memory banks, but in the fourth quarter of '17 where we had a significant investment in overall inventories, you will recall apart from the hurricane buying opportunities we had, we also invested into our Specialty business. And some of those opportunistic buying conditions related to getting some pretty attractive discounts from our suppliers, those discounts essentially get capitalized and get rolled into 2018 results for the Specialty unit, which obviously boosted certain margins. But at this point of time, that obviously has flown through that balance sheet and the income statement and the team is actually working to -- continue to hit its numbers. So again, we are quietly confident about the Specialty segment being able to hit its full-year targets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is open.","Daniel Imbro","Yes. Hey, good morning, guys.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Daniel.","Varun Laroyia","Good morning.","Daniel Imbro","I have question on North America. Obviously, growth slowed. It sounds like you\u2019re about flat on a same day basis, but we still saw margin up year-over-year as you guys execute on your pricing and discounting program. Can you talk a little bit about how your customers are responding to those changes? I mean, are you seeing any pushback from them? And then related to that, have we seen any update on OEM pricing here domestically? Thanks.","Dominick Zarcone","Yes. So, again, we got a little bit of a dichotomy in the North American growth with the core business actually as Varun just said, up about 1.8% on a same day basis. So I'm feeling pretty good about that. And as I mentioned in my comments, March was a lot better than January as well. So the near-term trends are good. We are adjusting our pricing based on the inflationary conditions that we\u2019re facing with respect to wages and rates and the like. We are being very thoughtful as to how we are doing that with our customers. It is a very competitive environment out there as you well know. And we are taking it day-by-day, and really customer by customer. All we are trying to do is have -- recover the incremental operating costs we are facing in running the business on a day in and day out basis. But given the [indiscernible] condition we have in this country and the impact that has on wages and the like. And the second half of your question? Daniel, you have a two-part question, I believe. Okay. We will go on to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Christopher Bottiglieri","Thanks for taking the question. So the question is on the EBIT margin improvement x self-service. It was exceptionally like very strong, which is great to see. As you assess your non-core operations, can you talk about your self-service business? And if you consider this to be a good business and core to your offering? And holding scrap prices steady, can you talk about the margin profile and capital intensity relative to the rest of North America? Thank you.","Dominick Zarcone","Yes. So our self-service business in North America is clearly the most cyclical, because that\u2019s where the largest impact that scrap pricing -- its manifest. In times where scrap is rising and we get benefit of that, that\u2019s obviously a clear benefit to the self-service business. In times like what we\u2019re seeing right now where scrap has come down materially since the first of the year, it's working against this. When you take it over kind of a multiyear view, the self-service business is a good performer with good double-digit margins and it adds to the overall value of the organization. More broadly, we\u2019re very proud of the North American margin improvement that we had as we initiated 170 basis points on the top line and 120 basis points improvement at the EBITDA line. When you take out the impact of self-service, which is really the impact of the scrap on the overall segment. We think that is very good. It's -- really the first time in about five quarters that we\u2019ve been able to post a positive year-over-year growth and EBITDA margins in North America. And we are looking forward for the team to continue that momentum as we complete the rest of the year.","Varun Laroyia","And Nick just to add to the comments you mentioned, so Chris, effectively if you look at on North America segment, which had an uptick with regards to gross margins by about 90 basis points. Without the self-service business that would have been up 170 basis points, so an incremental 80 bps. And if you think of it in terms of how that flows all the way through to EBITDA margins, while we are incredibly proud of the fact that the overall segment reported a 20 basis points up. As Nick mentioned, without the self-service business, it would have been 120 basis points up. So there's 100 point delta, 100 basis point delta right there at the EBITDA level. And I think the final part of your question was about the capital intensity of our self-service business. Listen, in terms of self-service capital intensity, it's actually pretty good. It actually lowers the overall capital intensity of the business. But if you think of the business model for our self-service where we have our stores or yards, take a pick in terms of what you would like to call them. The inventory that we have on offer on the salvage side has to be fresh, right? Once people come and pick their parts out of those vehicles, if it's there for more than call it three, max four weeks, it become stale. And so that's really when it become -- it gets kind of crushed and kind of again sent to the shredders, but effectively from a capital intensity perspective that product moves pretty darn quick. So on a capital intensity adjusted basis, the returns of that business are pretty good. The only issue, as you and Nick also kind of pointed out, is the volatility associated with the broader macroeconomic scenario with regards to scrap steel prices. That really is what kind of comes through. And then from an EPS perspective on a year-over-year basis, just to kind of reiterate, the reversal on scrap and as we\u2019ve talked about it in our guidance also that hit us for $0.04 on a year-over-year basis, Q1 '18 versus Q1 2019. So a $0.04 hit effectively on a year-over-year basis came through.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, guys. Two questions for me.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Merkel","Morning. So, first, in North America can you provide a little bit more color on the aviation and glass headwind? Is it one-off or should it continue? And then, secondly, can you comment on the competitive environment in Europe if things are the same or getting a little bit worse?","Dominick Zarcone","Sure. As it relates to the glass business, we\u2019ve taken a very purposeful approach to make sure that we can drive good margins there. Clearly it had a little bit of an impact on our revenue in the first quarter, that\u2019s probably going to linger with us as we proceed through 2019. Though, again, that\u2019s a business again where the costs get a little bit easier as we get into the back half of the year. The aviation business, again that -- it's different from the rest of our business and that\u2019s -- it's much fewer transaction of -- bigger dollar size per transaction, if you will. You\u2019re not selling a used engine for $800. You\u2019re selling used engines literally for hundreds of thousands of dollars. And so there is going to be more volatility. We are -- our expectation is in the aviation business. And again, the outlook for the year is -- the team is looking to hit their flat [ph].","Varun Laroyia","And then I think, Ryan, your second part of your -- of your two-part question was competition in Europe. So let me address that also. Listen, in terms of what we've talked about previously, we know there's a general downdraft with regards to economic sentiment across Europe in any case, the fact that there have been other folks that have public companies that have reported, which may have experienced negative growth. Each of our organic numbers that we\u2019ve kind of posted for our European business, each of our platforms actually delivered positive year-over-year organic. While it may have been anemic, they\u2019ve all came out with positive year-over-year organic. So, from that perspective, we feel good about it. We knew going into Q1 versus a year-ago, our European business a year-ago had been impacted by some operational challenges that have been well discussed and articulated. We are really happy with the way ECP has come through. That business as a market leader has continued to deliver and without the operational stumbles, is actually delivering on the promise we had -- we know that business can deliver. So on a broader basis, listen, the competition has always been there. Do we see any more intensity? Not really, it's always been pretty darn intense in any case. So from that perspective, no major shifts that we see specifically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Stember from CL King. Your line is open.","Scott Stember","Good morning.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Stember","Could you maybe frame out a little bit more the Europe organic sales situation. You did say that you saw that ECP was up nicely, I guess, compared to the rest of the regions. But maybe just give us an idea of how much it was up and maybe just frame that against some of the other regions? Just give us an idea of the performance in Eastern Europe. Thanks.","Dominick Zarcone","Yes. Scott, we don\u2019t provide guidance on a country-by-country basis. What I can tell you is on a same day basis Europe was well north of 2% and that was pretty much in line with ECP and most -- all of the businesses that we\u2019ve. So, no significant kind of deviation. Obviously, STAHLGRUBER is not in the organic numbers since we did it, complete that acquisition until May 31 of last year. So they won't really come into the whole, but for a month in Q2 and then really we will fully commence with the organic calculation going to get into Q3 of this year. But, again, across the board all of our platforms, if you will, think about ECP [indiscernible]. Rhiag, we are all in kind of that -- kind of low single-digit, 2% plus range that on a total basis was for the European segment. And that compare ECP last -- first quarter last year and then [indiscernible] organic. So that\u2019s where the big [indiscernible] came on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.","Jason Rodgers","Yes, you mentioned, you saw a significant improvement in March from January and February. I wonder if you could put any numbers around that and perhaps talk a little bit about what you're seeing in April?","Dominick Zarcone","Yes, so we don't provide monthly guidance, Jason. But let's just say that March was more consistent with where we had been historically, and the January numbers were pretty soft.","Varun Laroyia","Yes, and again Nick just to add to -- Jason, just to kind of confirm what we did mentioned in the opening remarks was specifically the sales intensity in our North America segment in the first quarter where January and February was slow. March has come through very strongly. Now, again, a whole host of different anecdotal information. What we do know as a fact is that there was the federal government shutdown in the month of January where 800,000 federal employees were essentially not being paid or essentially not at work, and that obviously has an amplification impact also. But again, as we talked about, we didn\u2019t talk about margins, we specifically talked about North America sales intensity that continue to improve as we ended towards the back end of the quarter.","Dominick Zarcone","Yes, and as we talked about last call too, right, the first two quarters of last year in North America had pretty much modest organic. So there is going to be tough comps, right. We are at, I think 6.8%, like 7.2% in Q1 and Q2 organic of 2018. And so again, we are going to have another quarter as we head into Q2, what we have -- some pretty high comps. And then the back half of the year obviously get much easier comps on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue. I will turn the call back to Nick Zarcone for closing remarks.","Dominick Zarcone","Well, thank you everyone for listening to our first quarter call here. We do appreciate your time and attention. Again, we feel very proud of the quarter we delivered. We think it puts us in very good standing as we head into the balance of the year. Again, there's nine months to run, if you will, so there's a lot of runway ahead of us. But all in all, we\u2019re feeling confident about 2019 and we certainly look forward to chatting with everybody in another 90 days when we report our second quarter results. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.","Joseph P. Boutross","Thanks, Brenda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we released our first quarter 2013 financial results. In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Quinn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rob and John have some prepared remarks, and then we will open the call for questions.","In addition to the telephone access for today's call, we are providing an audio cast via the LKQ website. A replay of the audio cast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call.","Before we begin with our discussion, I would like to remind everyone that the statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties, some of which are currently not known to us. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it was made, except as required by law.","Please refer to our Form 10-K and other subsequent documents filed with the SEC and the press release we issued this morning for more information on potential risk.","Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. As normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased with the results we reported this morning. Diluted earnings per share of $0.28 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013, increased 3.7% to $0.27 for the first quarter of 2012. As noted in the press release, the first quarter 2013 diluted earnings per share included a loss equal to $0.01 per share, resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Earnings per share in the first quarter of 2012 included a gain equal to $0.02 per share that resulted from a favorable legal settlement. Adjusting for these items, diluted earnings per share grew by 16% over the prior year quarter.","I am proud of our bottom line growth with the first quarter of 2013 producing record earnings.","Revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, an increase of 15.9% as compared to $1.03 billion in the first quarter of 2012. This revenue is the highest quarterly revenue achieved by LKQ since our founding.","During the first quarter of 2013, the company delivered strong organic revenue growth for parts and services of 9.6% despite fewer selling days in both North America and United Kingdom. I am particularly pleased with our North American organic revenue growth for parts and services, which grew at 4.7%. Adding back that extra business day, we estimate that our North American organic revenue growth for parts and services would have been 5.9% in the quarter, a quarter that also witnessed high fuel prices and a 1.4% decrease of miles driven for February year-over-year.","The solid growth in North American organic parts and service revenue for the quarter is primarily a result of a combination of the increased use of alternative parts by insurers and the Direct Repair Program networks to reduce claims costs. Year-over-year increases in claims frequency related to a more normalized winter pattern and our continued success in gaining market share.","During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 65,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 10% increase over Q1 2012.","As for volume at the auctions, the outlook for supply remains strong starting out in 2013. With inventory already on hand and a continuation of our current run rate for acquiring cars, we should have sufficient inventory to grow our recycled parts operations.","In our heavy-duty truck operations, during the first quarter, we purchased approximately 2,300 units for resale or parts as compared to nearly 1,800 in Q1 2012 or a 28% increase.","Turning to our self-service retail businesses. During the first quarter, we acquired over 128,000 lower-cost self-service and crush only cars as compared to nearly 89,000 in Q1 of 2012 or a 44% increase. Please note that a portion of this increase in procurement is related to the additional self-service locations we acquired and developed in 2012.","Now turning to Euro Car Parts. We continue to be impressed with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to capture market share. In Q1, ECP achieved strong organic revenue growth of 32.1%. With the continued performance in ECP's financial results and the strength of ECP's management team, I am pleased to announce that we have approved an additional 15 new branches for 2013 that are scheduled to open in the third and fourth quarter of this year.","I would also like to update everybody on our collision parts program in the U.K. A little over a year ago, we launched our collisions program in the U.K., and today I am proud to say that we are the leading distributor of aftermarket alternative collision parts in the U.K. In 1 year, we established trading agreements with every major body shop group in the U.K., grown our collision offerings to over 13,000 SKUs, and simultaneously, we have forged supply relationships with multiple carriers in the U.K.","During the quarter, we again witnessed strong double-digit year-over-year growth with our collision parts sales at ECP. Though off of a small base, today I am pleased to say that the collision sales are an ever-increasing portion of ECP's overall revenue mix. We believe we are positioned well for driving ECP's collision parts sales higher in 2013 and advancing our presence in the $3 billion U.K. collision parts market.","Lastly, on operations. On April 4, the company announced the launch of an intelligent parts solution with CCC Information Services. The solution applies rule-based search functionality to CCC's ONE Estimating software, which provides users access to LKQ's vast aftermarket parts inventory database. Users of CCC ONE Estimating for Insurance will now be able to search real time among the industry's most integrated aftermarket parts database collecting the best part for every job based on part type, availability, price and ship date.","Simultaneously, during this launch with CCC, we began beta testing in 5 body shops a second phase of this technology, which enables shop operators to click to order parts directly. Given the early acceptance of the second phase and its encouraging results, we have expanded the beta test to 20 body shops.","Now moving to acquisitions. On April 23, 2013, the company agreed to acquire Sator Beheer. Sator is the market-leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Northern France. Headquartered in Schiedam, the Netherlands, Sator is the parent company of 8 operating subsidiaries. The group has over 800 employees serving a diverse base of more than 6,000 customers and offering a broad product line of over 150,000 SKUs from 11 distribution centers.","In 2012, Sator reported revenue of EUR 288 million and EBITDA of EUR 24 million. Sator operates primarily in Western Europe, an automotive aftermarket parts market that is estimated to be $115 billion in size, servicing a car park of approximately 250 million vehicles. Approximately 85% of their 2012 revenue was derived from sales in the Netherlands and Belgium with the remainder in Northern France and exports throughout Europe. Their market share is approximately 20% in the primary markets they serve where industry dynamics are similar to the U.K. in terms of mandatory insurance, low APU for collision parts and a high acceptance for the APU for mechanical parts.","This strategically significant acquisition further increases LKQ's European footprint and market share and provides a platform for future growth on the continent.","Sator should also complement our existing Euro Car Parts operations in U.K. and allow for the realization of cost savings in purchasing and logistic synergies.","The purchase price is expected to be approximately EUR 210 million and will be funded by drawing on our revolving credit facility. The transaction is expected to close May 1, 2013. We have identified synergies primarily in the purchasing area that we should be able to achieve over the next 2 years, which are expected to improve our purchase place [ph] to below 6x EBITDA. With that said, we are limited in what we can disclose at this time beyond what I just provided during this call and during the Q&A.","As mentioned on the Q4 call, on February 21, 2013, the company purchased Autoclimate Ltd, our first tuck-in acquisition in the United Kingdom. Autoclimate has been fully integrated into ECP, and the full range of ECP products is now being offered to Autoclimate's customers.","Also through purchasing synergies, we have witnessed strong margin improvement in like-for-like products between ECP and Autoclimate. This type of integration and synergy success validates our continued efforts in exploring other tuck-in acquisitions to add to the ECP network and throughout the continent.","In addition to Autoclimate, during Q1, we acquired 2 additional companies, a paint distribution business in Ontario, Canada, and an aftermarket radiator distributor in Tampa, Florida.","At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results of the quarter.","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review our press release this morning. We expect to file our Form 10-Q with the SEC in the next few days, so please watch for that as well.","Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've slightly changed the segment disclosures dealing with revenue. In the past, our revenue growth components were focused around the type of revenue, including aftermarket, recycled parts and services and other revenue. Since our European operations have become a much larger portion of our revenue and because with Sator they will become proportionately larger still, we've begun to show revenue growth by geographic segment.","In the North American segment, we are combining the growth statistics for aftermarket and recycled parts and services. We'll continue to break out other revenue where we record scrap and core. We've long maintained that we'd like our customers to be indifferent to an aftermarket, recycled, refurbished or an OEM part. We manage our business with that mindset. Given that these products are frequently being sold to the same customers and carry economic similarities, we believe that investors should be indifferent whether we generate revenue through the sale of recycled, refurbished or aftermarket parts. Having said that, for the time being, we'll continue to provide car purchase volumes. It's only the components of revenue growth that we are combining.","Starting with the revenue. Our Q1 2013 revenue was $1.2 billion, an increase of $164 million compared to Q1 last year or an increase of 15.9%. Organic growth of 8.2% outstripped our acquisition growth 8%. We also had a negative 0.3% impact from exchange rates.","Parts and services revenue grew organically 9.6%. Within that category, as Rob mentioned, ECP continued to perform strongly with a 32% organic growth. In North America, parts and service growth was 4.7%, but with one less day which we estimated impacted growth negatively, 1.2%. We saw a 23% increase in other revenue where we record scrap and core. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of the growth while organic growth was negative 1% as our volume increases in the recycled operations were largely offset by lower commodity prices and the discontinuance of operations at one of our aluminum furnaces.","In Q1 2013, revenue for our self-serve business was $114 million or 9.5% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 31% of this revenue was part sales included in North American parts and services and 69% scrap and core sales included in other revenue.","Our reported gross margin for Q1 2013 was $502 million or 42% of revenue, a decline of 140 basis points from a gross margin percentage at 43.4% in Q1 2012. The previously discussed gain on legal settlement in Q1 last year accounts for 80 basis points with the decline, and the precious metals business we acquired in Q2 2012 accounted for a further 50 basis points of decline. The impact of scrap mix and all other items accounted for the 10 basis points balance of the change.","Facility and warehouse costs were 8.4% of revenue in Q1 2013, compared to 8.2% in the same quarter last year. This increase was due to the expansion in North America. During 2012, we completed the acquisition of 8 self-serve operations, which incurred greater facility costs as a percentage of revenue compared to our wholesale operations. Additionally, we added capacity in our wholesale operations, the revenue from which we expect to realize in the coming quarters.","Distribution costs were 8.7% this quarter compared to 8.9% in the same quarter last year, a decrease of 20 basis points. This decrease is primarily as a result of lower fuel costs along with a relative increase in the amount of other revenue we reported as other revenue, primarily being scrap, incurs few distribution costs.","Selling and G&A expenses were 11.5% of revenue in Q1 this year compared to 11.8%, primarily due to a reduction in personnel expenditures as a percent of revenue as we leveraged our general and administrative workforce across a higher revenue base. During the quarter, we recorded $1.5 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, primarily incurred for professional fees in conjunction with the acquisitions including Sator.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter increased to 1.5% of revenue during the first quarter of 2013, compared to 1.4% in Q1 last year. The increase is primarily due to amortization of intangibles and depreciation of property and equipment acquired as a result of the acquisitions we completed last year.","Other expenses, net, increased to $9.8 million in the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, compared to $5.5 million in the same period last year, an increase of $4.3 million. Interest expense was $1.2 million higher due to higher debt levels. And this year, we recorded an expense related to adjustments with contingent consideration of $800,000 compared to income of $1.3 million last year in the same period.","We also had an incremental $1.3 million of foreign currency losses in 2013 compared to the same quarter last year, mainly due to weakened pound sterling. These expenses were partly offset by improved collection fees for late payments, which generated an incremental $400,000 in 2013.","Our effective borrowing rate was 3.1% in Q1 2013 compared to 3% in Q1 2012.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 35.8% compared to 36.8% in Q1 last year. We continue to see some benefit from lower tax rates as our international business becomes a larger percentage of the total company.","On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.28 in Q1 2013 compared to $0.27 in Q1 2012. Last year, we had $0.02 favorable impact from a legal settlement. In Q1 this year, the acquisition-related expenses and contingent purchase price adjustments round to $0.01.","On an adjusted basis, the diluted earnings per share was $0.29 this year as compared to $0.25 last year or an improvement of 16%.","Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $106 million compared to $110 million in 2012, a reduction of 4% -- $4 million. The biggest drivers of this reduction were an additional $25 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher sequential revenue growth in Q1 2013 and the timing of cash collections. That use of cash was offset by lower incentive compensation payments in 2013 compared to the same quarter of the prior year.","In the first quarter, we spent $21 million in capital expenditures and $13 million in acquisitions. During the quarter, we reduced our net debt by $54 million. We ended Q1 with $1.1 billion of debt, and cash and cash equivalents were $63 million.","As of March 31, 2013, availability under our credit facility was $390 million. At quarter end, our debt under the credit facility was 67% fixed and 33% floating.","Now turning to guidance. As we stated in the past, our guidance excludes any restructuring costs, transactions costs, gains, losses, contingent purchase price adjustment, capital expenditures or cash flow associated with acquisition. Our guidance specifically excludes any impact of the Sator transaction we announced this morning or the related financing transaction we are working on.","Our revised guidance for organic growth from parts and services is 6.5% to 8.5%. We increased this range from 5.5% to 7.5% to reflect the slightly stronger Q1 in North America and our intention to restart the ECP branch expansion later this year.","Even though we left -- even though we increased revenue guidance for organic growth, we left the balance of the guidance unchanged. Although we're more bullish on organic revenue growth, a few short-term headwinds could impact our earnings. We continue to see softness in the sterling-U.S. dollar exchange rate. I mentioned the exchange and losses of $1.3 million in the quarter. If the average exchange rate stays near its current level compared to where we had anticipated it would be, we expect that exchange rate differential will continue to negatively impact us over the course of the year. We believe that our competitors are suffering similar impacts on their foreign currency purchases, and the ECP team is working to adjust prices to offset that impact but it will take time. In addition to the local earnings pressure that falling sterling causes, the local currency earnings of ECP will translate into fewer U.S. dollars.","Although we are increasing the number of branches at ECP, we've explained in the past that branches tend to lose money initially and cause an initial drag on earnings. We also anticipate a slight increase in our working capital requirements to accommodate these expansions, which will impact our cash flow from operations. We believe that the incremental capital spending required can be accommodated within our guidance range of $100 million to $115 million. Year-to-date, we've seen negative miles driven in the U.S.. Some of this year-over-year reduction may have been weather-related as last year's mild winter may have caused higher miles driven but also could be a sign of continued economics sluggishness. In this regard, we're simply being cautious until we know more.","Scrap was volatile in Q1. We believe that would have minimal overall impact year-over-year. Unfortunately in April, we've seen a general fall in commodity prices and unless they recover in the quarter, we would expect to be negatively impacted in Q2.","The Manheim Index stood at 120.4 at the end of March as compared to 126.2 a year earlier. We have seen a slight improvement in our car buying. Unfortunately the commodity value decreases are probably accounting for most of that reduction. At this time, we do not see margins in Q2 improving appreciably as a result of the reduction in used car prices. If the trend in prices continues for car prices, we may see a relief later in the year.","We shared with you Sator's revenue of EUR 288 million or USD 375 million; in 2012, reported EBITDA of EUR 24 million or $31 million at the current exchange rate. The reported EBITDA is before customary pro forma adjustments you'd expect in a company owned by a private equity firm. We believe the adjusted EBITDA would be a few million euros higher. We expect to close the transaction in the first week of May. Until we close, we'll not be able to completely finalize the purchase accounting adjustments including the amortization of intangibles.","We've also disclosed that we're working with our banks to amend and restate our credit facility, including an increase in the size of the facility. Until we complete the financings, we're not able to share with you the additional details regarding the financial impacts of the acquisition or potential financing changes. However, it is our intention to finance this transaction using longer-term fixed rates as the interest rates we expect to incur will likely be higher than our average borrowing rate of 3.1%.","When we adjust Sator's 2012 EBITDA for pro forma adjustments and after we achieve the identified synergies, we anticipate a purchase price below 6x EBITDA. These synergies primarily relate to procurement. While we're highly confident that these can be achieved, we believe it may take up to 2 years to fully implement these and have their impact flow through the inventory and through the income statement. So we are only expecting modest improvements in the remainder of 2013.","Finally, I'd like to give everybody a heads up that because of Sator acquisition, we're examining the timing of our Q2 earnings release. We've now confirmed a release date, but there's a possibility that release -- we will release on August 1 as opposed to what would be more typical of our timing a week earlier. And we'll confirm that exact timing in July.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rob.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, John. To summarize, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. In 2012, we were faced with unforeseen challenges in our core North American business. As we enter 2013, these challenges appear to be subsiding, which is evident with our first quarter organic revenue growth. Though headwinds continue, I am encouraged by the tailwinds we've benefited from in the quarter.","In addition, given our success with ECP, we are very excited about the pending acquisition of Sator. Sator has unparalleled market knowledge with a strong reputation and a high degree of credibility with customers, and we believe this transaction presents a great long-term opportunity for the company as we continue our European expansion. ECP continues to provide exciting growth opportunities for the company and we are quite pleased with its performance and the value it has created for our shareholders. We plan to continue to expand our ECP branch count in the U.K. by adding 15 additional branches in the third and fourth quarter of 2013.","Our position in North America is extremely strong relative to alternative parts competitors. LKQ is the only company with a national footprint and the only company of any size that offers a full range of alternative parts to our customers. Still, we are not fully built out and we believe there are opportunities to continue our North American growth both organically and through acquisition. All of these business units, supported by our 21,000 plus dedicated employees, allowed us to post a solid first quarter, which has positioned the company well for the balance of 2013.","Brenda, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Wanted to talk to your -- 2 quick questions. One, John, you gave some nice detail on kind of the dip in the gross margins when you exclude kind of the gain or whatever, still a lot of that due to the precious metal business. Could you talk about the overall profitability? I mean, obviously, you guys did a lot of acquisitions in the fourth quarter. Whether there is any additional mix issues coming from those or a little bit lower profitability near term and what's the opportunity to kind of maybe get those margins up over the next maybe 12 months or so?","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Nate. I'll start and maybe Rob can supplement. You're right, we did a fair number of acquisitions last year, 30 of which -- I think 1\/2 were in Q4. I would say the metals business is not yet fully integrated. We've started to decant some of our own catalytic converters and starting to process, but the majority of the cats are not going through there yet. When you look at some of the bigger acquisitions we did, which were up in Canada, I'd say those are still -- we're still in the implementation phase with respect to those. The facility and warehouses I talked a little bit about the drag that, that created on as a percentage of revenue facility and warehouse costs. If you look at the map that we typically publish, you see we still have duplicate facilities in multiple locations in Canada. So it's going to take a while to get through those. Still in the implementation phase with respect to a number of the acquisitions where we have overlap facilities.","Robert L. Wagman","And I would just add, Nate, one other acquisition I want to highlight is the shredder business that we bought in Q4. We are in the process of bringing all those -- our own cars to that shredder and still plenty of capacity to grow there. So early days there, but we're very excited about the opportunity that provides.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So it kind of sounds like all else equal assuming no extra benefit on the gross margin side from maybe lower used car prices or purchase prices, but it sounds like over the next 12 months we definitely can see some upside just on the overall margin line as everything kind of gets integrated assuming no new deals?","John S. Quinn","Yes, I don't know whether it'll come so much through the gross margin line. I think it's more leveraging the distribution and the warehousing costs.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then regarding the acquisition in Europe. Obviously, again, it sounds like a great foothold in the continent there. Could you talk, and I know it's too early to talk exactly about maybe what the accretion is, but I mean can you talk about the general accretion profile whether we'd get anything in '13 without giving exact numbers and what it might be in '14? And could you talk about the base premise of that model whether it is similar to like ECP in terms of more of a branch-based distribution model? And what the percentage currently comes from mechanical versus collision parts there?","Robert L. Wagman","Sure. Nathan, unfortunately due to the confidentiality provisions in our agreement with the sellers, we can't disclose too many details until we actually close, which we are scheduled to close on May 1. We are doing -- we plan on doing a follow-up after that with more updates on some of the questions you asked. However, I can talk about the market dynamics that we're getting into. The main competitors in the marketplace are generally smaller regional players. However, in other countries surrounding there, there are similar type of companies to the Sator operation. Very little of their sales today are in collision sales. The vast majority of their parts are going to be very similar to ECP in terms of aftermarket mechanical components. As I mentioned, they have approximately a 20% market share in the Benelux region. There is a high acceptance of alternative mechanical parts in the marketplace, very similar to the U.K. Some really good trends that we like: mandatory insurance, very low alternative part usage. So over time, our plan would be to bring our collision parts program from the U.K. over to the continent. 85% of Sator's revenue is in Belgium and the Netherlands. And just the overall Western Europe marketplace, about 250 million vehicles larger than the United States. And the part spend in the aftermarket, parts market, is a $115 billion. So really a great opportunity. We plan on using that obviously as our beachhead onto the continent and we will look to expand and we'll continue to look at opportunities throughout the continent.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just to follow-up on the Sator commentary. Is the model any different than in the U.K. where in the U.K., you acquired 89 stores and then expanded to 130 plus. It looks like this model is more based on DCs, you're acquiring 11. Maybe you could help us understand the difference in the model a little bit.","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, I think that's fair, Craig. It's a DC-type distribution business where they're selling into the marketplace. Great -- certainly, great penetration in the marketplace today with a 20% market share. So great upside for us there to keep growing the business. We'll be looking at that model. Our primary concentration from the beginning will be to focus on the synergies that John and I both spoke about in our prepared remarks. We think that's the greatest opportunity right out of the gate, is to focus on the purchasing synergies and look at logistic opportunities as well. So we're going to look to be able to share parts between the U.K. and our Netherlands operations. So that's where the focus is going to be out of the first year or so.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Regarding the synergies that you mentioned, you mentioned they are purchasing synergies, so I assume that all of that savings is on the cost side and not really on the revenue side yet?","Robert L. Wagman","That's correct.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then lastly, just with respect to your phase 2 test with CCC. I realize it's only 5 customers, but the click-through functionality seems like a meaningful upgrade. What kind of sales lift do you think that could provide and does that drive any of your assumptions regarding organic growth?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, let me talk about the difference between this program and the Mitchell program that we mentioned 2 quarters ago. The Mitchell program is not fully integrated with the estimating system, but this one is. So what we like about this system -- phase 2 of the Mitchell system was that we fully integrated with the estimating system. CCC's is already integrated, meaning the shop doesn't have to leave the estimate platform to see our products. So by staying in that system, we think it's going to be a lot more powerful. The second thing we like about the program is that CCC has the majority of the body shop business in the United States with Mitchell being a second and Solera being first. So we have a bigger data -- bigger customer base to focus on with this program. You're right, it is very early days, Craig. We only have 5 shops and initial tests now are up to 20. We're encouraged by the results. The beta shops have really enjoyed the B2B functionality of it, but it really is too early for us to be projecting how well this is going to be received in the marketplace. I think we'll have a better idea after Q2 or Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bret Johnson (sic) [Jordan] with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. And one, I might have missed this. Did you give any margin impact from the precious metals business in the first quarter?","John S. Quinn","It's 50 basis points.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. So it's very consistent with last year's run rate. And I guess if you look at that and sort of get a feeling for utilization, it doesn't sound like it's fully loaded. Is there sort of an expectation as we get into the anniversary of that acquisition the middle of this year, sort of a ramp rate at which point it begins to become less impactful?","John S. Quinn","The reason that they had their own metals business and that has not gone away and will discontinue. What we're really trying to do there is where we've got revenue -- precious metal revenue out of the cars we're selling. We're really just trying to capture some of the value that's the downstream impacts with the refiners. So I don't think you're going to see a dramatic change from that frankly because they'll continue to do their own processing of third-party metals.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then a question on Sator. Do you -- at least color for us as far the growth rate and their revenues that EUR 288 million was up from x in the prior year, sort of get a feeling for how that business has been growing prior to the acquisition?","Robert L. Wagman","We will update. After we close, Bret, we'll be updating everybody on those figures.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Joshua Wilson","This is Josh filling in for Sam. Could you talk a little bit about the ECP multiple you ended up paying after the earn-outs and sort of compare and contrast the purchase price for ECP and Sator and the justification for each?","John S. Quinn","I don't have that off the top of my head. The total consideration was EUR 280 million. If the earn-out -- excuse me, GBP 280 million for ECP, assuming that the earn-outs are fully paid. And the EBITDA, you can actually get the EBITDA because we disclosed that in the Qs. Just be careful to add back the changes and consideration.","Joshua Wilson","I think x the earn-out, you were somewhere 8x when the deal was first announced. So I just was wanting to understand the thoughts on the 2 different.","John S. Quinn","I don't want to quote a number, but it's going to be dramatically less than that.","Joshua Wilson","And the reason for that?","John S. Quinn","I'm saying -- I'm sorry, Josh?","Joshua Wilson","What was the reason for the difference?","John S. Quinn","Oh, at the time of the acquisition, you were saying it was around 8x. I don't recall that. I'm just saying that if you look at whether the EBITDA or ECP is throwing off now and assume that we fully paid the consideration, we can work up the number. But it's well under 8x.","Joshua Wilson","Okay. I'll come back on that later then. And does this reduce your bandwidth any for U.S. acquisitions?","Robert L. Wagman","No, it doesn't, Josh. We have teams on both sides of the pond working deals, and the acquisition pipeline actually is still relatively strong. We did push a little bit lighter in North America with us announcing only 2 deals this quarter. I think that was because of the rush in Q4 to beat the tax deadline. We mentioned that we did 15 deals in Q4. So a little bit slower in North America, I think, just catching up. But the pipeline remains very active on both sides.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Rob, did you say that the Mitchell system that you're working with now is not fully integrated into the estimating system yet, but it will be?","Robert L. Wagman","That's correct, yes. It was 2 phases. The first phase was a B2B buying. So they actually leave the estimating platform to see our inventory. With CCC, they don't have to leave the estimating platform. We mentioned on the last call that Mitchell had a phase 2 that's supposed to be released in Q3. That will be very similar to CCC's. It's fully integrated where the shop or the insurance company never has to leave the estimate.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And with both of these and I guess the third estimating system in the country as well, you will be the only recycler that has this capability?","Robert L. Wagman","Today, yes. There are plans maybe to open up in the future, but we are the only ones right now with both companies.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just a couple of quick questions. How many ECP branches did you end the quarter with?","Robert L. Wagman","We were at 132 and then we have 1 with Autoclimate, so that's 133.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then in terms of the alternative part usages -- usage on the continent, you said it's low. Trying to figure there, is it similar to the U.K.?","Robert L. Wagman","Very similar to the U.K., Gary. We estimated it's between 5% and 8%. And what we've always said is that it's many of the same insurance companies writing in the U.K. also writing the continent. So our hope is that we can piggyback on our relationships in the U.K. that we've already developed through the launch eventually on the continent as well.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","That was my next question. I mean, in terms of crossover, I mean, all the major players are writing in the U.K. as well as the continent on insurance basis, what about those that are smaller ones that are domiciled in the U.K. that you may be working with? Do they write on the continent as well?","Robert L. Wagman","All the big players do, of course, write both on the U.K. and the continent. I think it's fair to say that there's regional players in the U.K., there'll be regional payers on the continent as well. So there'll be a little bit of difference there, but it's the 80-20 rule here with the big carriers owning the majority of the market share.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And I assume you're working with all the big carriers that are in the U.K. right now, right?","Robert L. Wagman","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Stember with Sidoti & Co.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Could you talk about how the weather impacted the quarter? Obviously, we had some extraneous amounts of snow that hit the Northeast. Could you just talk about on the net basis how it helped you and if there's any lingering impact into the second quarter?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, it was a winter that finally arrived. It was pretty interesting when you look at the stats that, really before February, we were actually behind our normal expectation. And then late February and March, the Northeast really got pounded pretty good. Certainly, we believe that it certainly didn't hurt the Q1. We certainly believe that it brought enough of volume into the marketplace in the collision repair industry. And April is very much the plan right now. So we think that it's pushed some of that weather in March into April. So it really had some nice late winter weather to help us in late Q1 and early Q2.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And North America, looking at the parts and service, I know you're not breaking it out anymore but could you just give some high-level commentary of how the recycled parts side did, namely, the mechanical parts just with some reports of some weakness there over the last -- particularly in March?","John S. Quinn","I don't know if we've seen any appreciable change in our mechanical. Keep in mind, our mechanical sales are primarily large-ticket items like engines and transmissions that really are not discretionary in terms of people's ability to time those. When somebody's engine blows, they generally have to go and get it fixed. And it's primarily just driven off our car buying in Q4. So I don't think we've been impacted particularly.","Robert L. Wagman","And quite frankly, Scott, with the aging car part, our engine transmission businesses is very strong right now. So we didn't see any impact at all to our mechanical components.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, got you. And just last question, just following up on the U.K. and the collision parts initiative, how many insurers do you have programs with now?","Robert L. Wagman","We have relationships with 8 insurers today, all in pilot stage, but continuing and growing by the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","With the Sator acquisition, you had mentioned that this is also in Northern France, and I was under the impression that France has legislation in place that requires new parts -- aftermarket parts to be used. So -- and that was one of the reasons why Europe was going to be a difficulty for you in terms of your strategy going forward. But now it seems like you're more comfortable with the aftermarket business over there?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, Richard, let me clarify the law there. The law is for collision parts only that have to be OEM parts only. So on the mechanical, the aftermarket mechanical, there is not that same restriction. So that only applies to collision parts, and our collision parts sales in the continent are very low today. So that didn't hinder us at all. Now, with that being said, France is an interesting country. So I'm not sure what our plans will be to expand in France at this point. It's still early days, but we certainly won't be pushing our collision parts into that marketplace. But as far as mechanical parts, they are readily accepted in France.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Now this business, it sounds more something that's like a Napa. Is that characterization fair to say about Sator?","John S. Quinn","Yes, they distribute mechanical parts, very similar mechanical parts as ECP did.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is this the type of operation -- would you be considering this type of operation to acquire here in the United States?","Robert L. Wagman","We certainly are looking at the hard part industry in all markets. It's an intriguing part of our business. It's a little bit different model that what we operate here today in terms of the way we deliver our products. Those tend to be more hotshot and we tend to be a little bit more once-a-day delivery for our collision and heavy mechanical parts. But it's certainly something we will continue to look at in the States as well.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And when you say hotshot, you mean you deliver on demand?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, and they tend to deliver in the U.K. and at Sator within 30 minutes to 45 minutes. So they'll have a truck waiting just to dispatch immediately once the call comes in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Sorry, I'm late to the call. But could you give me just a couple of, I know you've probably been through this on the acquisition, a little bit of the size of the market that Sator is addressing?","Robert L. Wagman","Sure. Let me talk about the Western European market first, John. Western Europe is about USD 115 billion parts, aftermarket parts market. There are over 250 million vehicles on the road there in the Western European. 85% of Sator's revenue is in the Belgium and the Netherlands. Very similar market dynamics as what we've seen in the U.K. Mandatory insurance with very, very low levels of alternative part usage on the collision side. There is a high acceptance of alternative mechanical parts. So that obviously bodes well for us. They have about a 20% market share in the Benelux region. And basically, the main competitors are small regional players. If you get outside of their main markets they operate, there are similar companies to Sator in Germany, France, et cetera. But really great growth opportunity and plenty of runway left.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And the situation with the ownership, was it -- what was the situation for the seller?","Robert L. Wagman","Private equity.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","It was private equity. And they've had it how long?","Robert L. Wagman","3 years, 3 or 4 years.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And once again you probably covered it, was there anything unusual in the cost structure in the quarter?","John S. Quinn","Anything unusual -- I'm sorry, John, anything unusual what?","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","In the cost structure other than just some of the comparisons to onetime items, et cetera. Was there anything else unusual in the cost structure?","John S. Quinn","No, just COGS that there was in Q1 last year with the...","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes, right. But other than that comparison, nothing else unusual?","John S. Quinn","No.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And what did you say, what are the cost of the car do in the quarter?","Robert L. Wagman","In the quarter, our average cost in Q1 2012, we were at about $19.31 per car, John. In this quarter, year-over-year, we're $18.70. So seeing a little bit of improvement there.","Operator","In this case, since there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the floor back over for closing comments.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, Brenda. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you again in a few months to report our Q2 results. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."],"13472":["LKQ Corp.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Boutross, you may begin.","Joseph P. Boutross - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Devon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Rob Wagman and Nick Zarcone. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.","Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Rob Wagman, our CEO.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high level financial metrics, followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q2. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance.","Turning to slide three. Q2 revenue reached a record $2.45 billion, an increase of 33.3% as compared to $1.84 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $140.7 million, an increase of 17.6% as compared to $119.7 million for the same period of 2015.","On an adjusted basis, net income was $169.2 million, an increase of 34% as compared to the $126.3 million for the same period of 2015. Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 for Q2 increased 17.9% from $0.39 for the second quarter of 2015, while adjusted diluted EPS increased from $0.41 to $0.55, an increase of 34.1%. Nick will provide more specifics on these adjustments shortly.","During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was a respectable 5.4%, despite facing tough year-over-year comps and a continuation of the challenging weather dynamics we faced in Q1 globally.","Let's now turn to our North America operations. There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter in Q1 continued into Q2 as collision claims were down in many states. According to CCC, total year-to-date collision claims were up only 2.3%. In addition, the U.S. market witnessed average temperatures well above historical levels, making year-to-date 2016 the third warmest on record with only 2012 and 2006 being warmer.","Also, year-to-date precipitation was mixed across North America with key markets like Pennsylvania witnessing levels 17% below historical averages, while Colorado was 14% above. With that said, it's important to note that this impact was not consistent across North America. The geographic regions of Canada, the Northeast and the Midwest had declines in Q1 repairable claims and organic growth and the metrics in these regions were soft again in Q2.","Conversely, our Central and Southeast regions which had nearly double-digit organic growth in Q1 continued that trend of solid organic growth in Q2. Despite the tough comp and the short-term challenges of weather and subsequent lower claims volume, North America delivered Q2 and year-to-date organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.1% and 4% respectively.","During Q2, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.9% decrease over Q2 2015. Procurement costs at auction increased over Q2 2015 by 2.7%. But again, we continue to buy a slightly younger vehicle year-over-year.","For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.6% and 16.8%, respectively, year-over-year and in the quarter.","In addition, our North American operations improved gross margins during the quarter which included 40 basis points of improvement from the aftermarket procurement initiatives implemented during 2016.","And lastly, during the quarter, we added a top 10 carrier to our Keys IQ (05:35), proprietary aftermarket parts program. This carrier was a solid win for our North American team, given this carrier was using aftermarket parts only on a limited basis.","We expect to have the entire program fully deployed by November 1, 2016. In our self-service retail business during Q2, we acquired over 138,000 lower cost self-service and crush only cars which is a 5.3% increase over Q2 2015. Similar to Q1, we increased our self-service procurement to take advantage of the favorable pricing to the higher quality vehicles in this line of business. Nick will provide more details on scrap shortly.","Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC. During Q2, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders processed through the CCC platform grew 91% and 66% respectively year-over-year.","Briefly, I want to provide an update on our sales force effectiveness and route optimization productivity initiatives discussed on the last call. During the quarter, our sales force effectiveness efforts focused on increasing the level of outbound calls per sales rep which increased from 17.2 to 18 per day, a 4% increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 2016.","In addition, in June, we launched an add-on sales program to drive incremental sales per order with a specific group of SKUs. The early results of this launch are encouraging with some of the SKUs in the program doubling in sales.","Though the dollar increase in sales from this program are minimal, the intent is to instill discipline in our sales force to continuously focus on selling deeper into every customer and every order. Also, during the quarter, we continue to make great strides with the implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. At the end of Q2, our current utilization rate with Roadnet reached 80%, accounting for over 3,400 vehicles driving over 285,000 miles and making over 42,000 stops on a daily basis.","Thus far with this initiative, our focus has been to introduce our operations to the use of Roadnet. Once we have reached full installation by year end, we will begin the arduous task of assessing all the opportunities that exist across our networks and fleet. Combined, this should generate operational efficiencies and incremental margin within our North American business.","Now moving to our European operations. In Q2, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8% and acquisition growth of 57.5%, primarily related to Rhiag which were offset by a decrease of 3.7% related to foreign exchange rates.","During Q2, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 9.6%, and for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 7.8%. I am pleased with this growth given the extremely wet weather conditions in the quarter.","According to the UK Met Office, June was the 11th wettest since 1910 which had a slight impact on road travel in the midst of a normal busy driving season. During the quarter, ECP opened seven new branches, bringing our network to 206 branches.","During Q2, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 18.2%. Also during the quarter, ECP collision entered into a parts agreement with CRN or the Car Repair Network, a nationwide network of over 170 repairers that combined are responsible for over 18,000 repairs per year. In addition to CRN, we successfully achieved approval status for the supply of parts to the largest UK repair group, Nationwide Accident Repair Centers, following its successful tender process.","And lastly on ECP, I'd like to note that while the UK referendum to leave the EU has created some near-term uncertainty and negatively impacted its currency, we do expect that people will largely continue to drive their vehicles. As most of you are aware, the demand for the parts we sell in Europe are related to the total miles driven in the average age of cars on the road. Neither of which should be directly impacted by the results of the referendum. And frankly, in tough economic times, the value proposition of alternative parts becomes more attractive. Nick will provide additional color on the referendum impact shortly.","And now turning to our Sator business. During Q2, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.4%. Also, as mentioned on our Q1 call, our investments in 2014 and 2015 continue to drive margin improvements at Sator with Q2 recording the highest gross and EBITDA margins achieved since acquiring the business in May of 2013.","And now an update on Rhiag. Q2 was the first full quarter of ownership of Rhiag. Overall, Rhiag tracked in line with our expectation and is executing on its growth initiatives. Since we acquired Rhiag in March, it has added 11 new branch locations to the network. We have been very busy with the integration with our teams focused on the purchasing functions. As I speak, we are keenly focused on gathering the necessary data and putting in place the communication lines to achieve the targeted synergies for building a sustainable pan-European procurement function.","As an example, we have learned that Rhiag has certain branded products that ECP will be able to distribute, allowing ECP to augment or replace some of its existing suppliers. Not only will this example reduce the number of vendors and the complexity associated with the current suppliers in the UK, but it will also improve margins.","With that said, we continue to believe that we are well along and on the right path to building a company that's unique that will have benefit from our scale and common ownership to create a leading position throughout all of Europe.","Now on to our specialty segment. Our specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 18.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 8%. This continued solid organic growth is largely due to the expansion of our specialty delivery routes, the integration of the Coast business on to our existing delivery fleet, expanded warehouse service levels, a strong SAAR and enhanced inventory offerings. And lastly, specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating additional Coast distribution centers into our existing network. At the end of Q2, only 4 of the 17 original Coast warehouses were in operation.","As previously mentioned, on April 21, 2016, the company closed its acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. With this acquisition, we now have a new reporting segment that Nick will cover further. Regarding their operations, during the quarter, the PGW team secured a manufacturer renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch, and also, a one-year renewal contract with a large North American MSO for their ARG business.","In addition to the PGW acquisition during the second quarter of 2016, LKQ acquired a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Belgium.","At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more details and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter and over the next few minutes I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our core segments during the second quarter, before touching on the balance sheet and then addressing our revised guidance for 2016.","The short version of our financial performance in Q2 of 2016 is that we had a terrific quarter, and taken as a whole, performed ahead of our expectations. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations performed well, the two big acquisitions were slightly above target and we finally got a small boost from a sequential increase in scrap steel prices.","To refresh everyone's memory, Rhiag closed in late March and was included for the full quarter while PGW closed in late April and contributed for only 10 weeks. As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the second order of 2016 was $2.45 billion, representing a 33% increase over last year. That reflects a 36.8% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by an 11.2% decrease in other revenue.","The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 5.4% from organic, plus 32.8% from acquisitions, for a constant currency growth of 38.2% before backing out the translation impact of FX which was a 1.4% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results.","As noted on page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 180 basis points to 37.6% due entirely to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that when we initially announced the transactions, we highlighted the fact that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the two big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up by about 70 basis points during the quarter.","While consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also about 160 basis points below last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the two acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses.","Segment EBITDA totaled $319 million for the quarter, reflecting a 37% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 13%, a 30-basis point increase over the 12.7% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced an increase in restructuring cost, primarily related to expenses connected with the integration of our specialty acquisitions.","Depreciation and amortization was up almost $23 million, most all of which relates to the impact of the two big acquisitions. The same holds true for interest expense which was up by about $12 million. With that, pre-tax income increased 16% over last year.","Our effective tax rate during the second quarter was 34.75%, down from the 34.85% in 2015 and consistent with the annual guidance we provided in April. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.46 which was up 18% compared to the $0.39 reported last year. Adjusted EPS which is before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain, intangible asset amortization and a non-cash inventory step-up adjustment related to the PGW acquisition was $0.55 a share versus $0.41, reflecting a 34% improvement.","As mentioned, the impact of scrap was a bit of a tailwind in the quarter and actually helped earnings per share by about $0.02. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.01 during the second quarter and we anticipate that currencies will have a bigger negative impact in the back half of the year, given the devaluation of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote.","As highlighted on page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This became more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW and you saw a shift in the second quarter metrics where in North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of the consolidated total.","And with that, let's get on to the details of the operating segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the second quarter of 2016 increased to $1.81 billion or a 3.4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 5.6% growth rate in parts and services, offset by 11.4% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to the sale of our precious metals business at the end of Q2 of last year, and lower prices received for other metals such as aluminum, platinum, palladium and rhodium relative to Q2 of last year.","The 5.6% growth in North American parts and services was the combination of 3.1% organic growth and 2.8% acquisition growth, offset by a 30-basis point FX decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter had a bleed over impact on our Q2 revenue. According to CCC, repairable collision claims were down on a year-over-year basis in many of the big population snow belt states, including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.","Collision parts simply don't sell as well when accident frequency is down. As Rob mentioned, this was not consistent across North America, as our Central and Southeast regions which had excellent organic growth in Q1 continued to report above average organic growth in Q2. Gross margins in North America during the second quarter were 44.1%, a 170 basis-point increase over 2015.","The benefits of the procurement initiatives started to manifest themselves in Q2 and the lower cost of aftermarket inventory added approximately 40 basis points of improvement to the gross margin of our overall North American operations.","Salvage also experienced a slight increase in gross margins, while our self-service operations contributed a 110 basis-point increase to North American gross margins, largely reflecting the sequential improvement in scrap steel pricing. You will note that scrap spiked in May, reaching over $150 per ton, but has reversed course and we're now back down into the low $100 range.","With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we gained about 30 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year, reflecting improvements in both the wholesale and self-service operations. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in both fuel and facility cost, relative to last year, but on the downside, we lost a bit of margin related to freight expense.","In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the second quarter was $164 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 15.2% in Q2 of this year, up 190 basis points from the 13.3% reported in the comparable period of the prior year.","You will recall that in Q1, we indicated that we expected the benefit from our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move through the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefit in our cost of goods sold, related to the procurement savings of our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in many other expense categories across North America.","The route optimization effort is now rolled out across 80% of the country, and we anticipate we will begin to see the positive impact of that program begin to accrue over the next few quarters. In total, we estimate that the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the second quarter was approximately $0.01 a share.","Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the second quarter accelerated to $824 million, up from $510 million, a 62% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the second quarter was 8%, reflecting the combination of 9.6% growth at ECP, 4.4% growth at Sator, and 9.9% in Sweden. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 58% increase in revenue with most \u2013 with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag.","So, on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 66%. These gains were offset by a 4% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. As you can see on page 19, the average rate during the quarter for the sterling was about 6% below last year, and it fell an incremental 7% to about $1.33 at quarter end due to the Brexit vote.","More recently, the sterling has been down further to about $1.30 to $1.31. The translation impact of this will absolutely weigh on a reported U.S. dollar result for the rest of the year, probably to the tune of $0.01 in each of the third and fourth quarters.","Gross margins in Europe were 37.4%, a 50 basis-point decline from the comparable period of 2015, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins in Europe increased 100 basis points as we continue to benefit from improved procurement in the UK and the internalization of the gross margin from our acquisitions in the Netherlands.","As mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the three step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator.","The impact was not as significant as initially anticipated, however, and after mapping Rhiag's general ledger accounts to LKQ's chart of accounts and completing the conversion from IFRS to U.S. GAAP, Rhiag had gross margins of about 34.6% during the second quarter.","With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 60 basis-point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from a 170 basis-point reduction in operating expense due to the addition of Rhiag which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than either ECP or Sator.","We also saw about a 40-basis point improvement in SG&A expense as a percent of revenue primarily at ECP. Offsetting these gains was 140-basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense. As you will recall, we started paying rents and related property costs on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England in February. The incremental costs related to this project in Q2 were approximately \u00a32.2 million or about $3.2 million which reflects a 40-basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe.","We were also impacted by new branches in-housed at ECP and an increase in warehouse personnel at Sator related to new product introductions. European EBITDA totaled $90 million, a 67% increase over last year, reflecting solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag.","Excluding the negative impact of FX rates, constant currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 71%. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was 10.9% versus 10.6% last year, a 30-basis point improvement, even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project.","Turning to our specialty segment. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $337 million, a 19% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 8% was quite strong while the impact of the Coast acquisition in August of 2015 added 11% to revenue growth.","Gross margins in our specialty segment for the second quarter decreased about 160 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of stocking two new specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State, which were not in operation at this time last year, as well as increased customer volume rebates associated with the higher sales levels.","Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in specialty were up about 30 basis points. Facility expense increased due to certain costs related to the two new distribution centers mentioned a bit ago. On the plus side, we continue to see the SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices.","EBITDA for the specialty segment was $42 million, up 4% from Q2 of 2015, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the specialty segment decreased 170 basis points to 12.4% in 2016 compared to 14.1% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year.","On page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $210 million which again reflects 10 weeks of activity. You should note, Q2 tends to be a very strong quarter for PGW.","Gross margins were 18.4%, but this included a one-time non-cash charge of $10 million, reflecting the write-off of inventory. You may recall that on the Q1 call, I mentioned that under U.S. GAAP, we had to mark the closing date inventory of PGW up to the market value, and this increase would get amortized as a non-cash expense as we turn the inventory. We anticipated an $8 million to $12 million charge and it came right in the middle at $10 million.","It doesn't affect our adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it was a one-time hit to gross margin, diluted net income and diluted EPS during the quarter. Excluding this one-time non-cash item, the gross margin at PGW would have been 23.3% which is generally consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced.","EBITDA margins for PGW were 11.1%, slightly higher than the annual level mentioned when we announced the transaction, largely reflecting the seasonality of the business as Q2 tends to be relatively strong.","Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first six months was approximately $355 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital.","During the first six months of 2016, we deployed a little more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $102 million to fund capital expenditures and almost $1.8 billion to fund acquisitions.","The acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW were financed by drawing down on our line of credit, and the completion of a euro note offering back in April. We closed the quarter with approximately $273 million of cash, of which, $196 million was held outside of the United States, and we had slightly more than $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding.","So our net debt was approximately $3.1 billion, and on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our leverage ratio was about 2.8 times, latest 12-month EBITDA. At quarter end, total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.1 billion which we believe is sufficient to support the continued growth of our businesses.","Finally, as you noted in the press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Again, Rhiag closed on March 18 and PGW on April 21, so we will record a tad more than nine months and eight months of their respective results in 2016. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we slightly reduced the guidance for 2016 to 5.5% to 7.0%, reflecting the softness in the North American year-to-date results following the mild winter.","Our range for adjusted EPS which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization is now $1.79 to $1.87 per share with the midpoint of $1.83. The increase from the previous midpoint of $1.81 reflects the better than expected Q2 results, partially offset by anticipated headwinds from the currencies in the back half of the year, particularly the pound sterling, lower scrap steel prices than experienced in Q2, and a better appreciation for the seasonality of the two new acquisitions, particularly related to typical Q4 slowdowns.","The new EPS guidance assumes the pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.30 and $1.10, respectively, and importantly that scrap remains at current levels as well. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains constant at 34.75%.Our current guidance for cash flow from operations is up a bit to approximately $585 million to $635 million, and the guidance for capital spending is unchanged.","At this point, I will return the call back over to Rob to wrap up.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nick. To summarize, we are pleased with our second quarter performance. As we enter the back half of 2016, I am confident that we will continue to execute on our performance priorities of organic growth, margin expansion, the leveraging of our networks and our passion for delivering our one-stop shop solution and industry leading fill rates to each of our customers.","We believe that great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together. Every day, our 38,000 plus employees work together to build a better company for our customers and shareholders, and for that, I would like to say thank you.","This team effort combined with our unique competitive position in each of our business segments continues to translate into consistent earnings growth for our shareholders which has allowed us to increase our guidance for 2016, despite the unpredictable weather anomalies we faced earlier this year.","And with that, Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Rob, it looks like you mentioned collisions were soft. But are you seeing any impact from growth in the number of cars in your sweet spot that might offset some of the weakness in collision activity?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Craig, it was soft as I said in my prepared remarks. CCC reported 2.3% growth, and we came in at 4% for the first half. So we still are taking market share, but to answer your question about the cars hitting the sweet spot, we expect that at the end of this year, early 2017. So, as the cars start coming out of that \u2013 hitting that three-year spot, so it's pretty flat right now year-over-year. But at the end of 2016, early 2017, we start to see it expand.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then, Nick, to what extent can you quantify the impact of the efficiency projects you're undertaking in North America? I know you've made a number of changes there. I'm wondering what you think the full annualized impact might be down the road.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, Craig, as we mentioned on several calls here, we're going to report that as we go. We are thrilled that in Q2, the total impact was $0.01 per share to the positive. Just to put that in perspective, that's \u2013 $0.01 a share is $5 million of pre-tax. We would anticipate that we've got that locked in for the rest of the year. We do anticipate to be able to garner some improved efficiencies as we move through 2016 and 2017 because some of the programs take a little bit of time to ramp up. But, again, on a \u2013 if you want to annualize the second quarter, that'd be $0.04 a share or the better part of $20 million.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Nate.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","So just to dig a little bit further on the organic growth, I mean clearly, weather is what it is. Normally, with some of the positive factors in terms of the miles driven, more parts to repair, all the things that we've talked about, particularly and again, with somewhat of the market share gains, I'd still normally expect the spread between the industry growth and you guys to be just a little bit wider, I mean still positive. Just wondering if there was anything going on there in terms of the mix of geographies? Again, you pointed out some were stronger, some were a little bit weaker. And then, also, whether may be the conversion to Roadnet had any bit of, at all, any disruption in terms of that organic growth at all?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Certainly, the geographic differences, Nate, were pretty stark actually. We were very strong in the South and the Central regions. And the Rust Belt or the Winter Belt was very, very light. it really matched up almost identical with what CCC gave us for claims. One other thing that CCC pointed out to us was pretty interesting, a later model car is being repaired now, which is a little bit of headwind at first because obviously newer cars will get new parts. There aren't a lot of used parts in for the stream yet as well as the aftermarket parts for that matter.","So we are expecting when that sweet spot moves our way, we are expecting to see more growth in our \u2013 for those type of products because it will just be much more demand. Remember, we talk about that three to eight years, we're bringing in that 2009 model year now car where it was the lowest SAAR production of all. So we'll get through it next year, and we think a lot more cars will start hitting the sweet spot.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then in terms of \u2013 well, and maybe this is a separate question then. But in terms of the conversion over to Roadnet, obviously, you'll get a lot of ultimate efficiencies on that. But is there any like near-term disruption in terms of your drivers just getting used to that or in terms of just the different routing schedules?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. There are some pretty smoothly actually. We did a very controlled rollout of that, so no hiccups there. What we do anticipate is once we get the whole country rolled out, we'll start looking at the individual routes to really start to drive the efficiency. So no real hiccups in that rollout at all.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. But, Nate, just to be clear, there's absolutely no correlation between the distribution of the parts which is really what Roadnet goes after and the ultimate sale of the part. The reality is, when collision frequency is down, you're going to sell less parts.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sure. Totally get that. Okay. And then in terms of the procurement effort over in Europe, that obviously seems to be progressing well. Can you talk about, particularly with now Rhiag in the fold a little bit in terms of how those discussions are going and how much further you think in terms of the opportunity, in terms of those procurement savings?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Obviously, what we're doing now, Nate, is working with each individual manufacturer and pooling our combined purchases. And that's an arduous task to get through to get them to, obviously, agree to the terms that we're looking for and pooling all of those orders together. As we add more and more companies, it kind of resets it every time. So the talks are well under way. We have consolidated our purchasing under one lead person now for Europe. And those talks will continue and we'll continue to obviously work those. September is \u2013 big conference over there, it's called Automechanika. We have meetings with every one of our manufacturers and expect some positive results out of those meetings.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just a check-the-box question but any updates on State Farm in terms of how those discussions are going? Obviously, maybe they got a little bit of reprieve in terms of accident rates here in the first half, but obviously, the pressures keep building I would think.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I would love to say that that top 10 carrier I mentioned in my prepared remarks was State Farm, it was not, unfortunately.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Right. Okay.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It was a carrier who had multiple brands and only one of the brands was using my aftermarket parts and now they're bringing the whole company over. So that's a good win. As far as State Farm goes, no, nothing new there, Nate. I agree with you that they may have gotten a little bit of reprieve this half, first half, but GEICO continues to take market share and we keep talking to State Farm on a regular basis.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for all that.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks good morning, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ben.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","So, if I look at your organic parts and services guidance for the full year, and I try to infer second half North American organic growth, it looks like it's something mid single-digits. Is it fair \u2013 which that suggests a sequential acceleration in the two-year stack in North America, is it fair to think that the tail for this weather impact starts to dissipate here as we move into the back half?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's our thoughts, Ben, that we should start to normalize here now. And we are anticipating mid single-digits back to where we projected earlier in the year.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, Nick, if you could, and this is a little bit handholding, but are you able to quantify the embedded assumptions around the impact from FX scrap steel on an EPS basis for the balance of the year?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. We believe that if the currency rates stay where they are, basically $1.30 on the pound and $1.10 on the euro, that will hit us as I indicated in my prepared remarks for about $0.01 a share a quarter, so $0.01 in the third quarter, $0.01 in the fourth quarter. On scrap, we got $0.02 to the positive in the second quarter. That was an unexpected surprise.","If you look at the chart in the deck, you saw that the scrap prices during the month of May hit just north of $150 a ton. The average for the quarter was $1.38 which is up from $91 in Q1. And now we're back down to $115, right. And so, if you look at the change last year from Q2 to Q3, we went from $140 a ton, down to $123. And if you went to the Q3 script last year, that was $0.02 a share to the negative.","So, if you just replay that this year, there could be as much as $0.02. We're hoping it will be a little bit less just because we were on a consistent downward trend in scrap pricing last year. This year, it's only the one quarter tick up and then it looks like back down. So there's a chance it won't be quite as significant, but figure $0.01 or $0.02 in the back of the year for scrap as well.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then I think, Nick, I heard you say that when everything shook out on Rhiag, gross margins in the quarter were 34.6%, which is materially higher than what was anticipated on a full year basis. How does that change your expectation for the full year basis for Rhiag's gross margin profile?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the total doesn't change when you think about the underlying profitability of the company. It's just \u2013 under IFR \u2013 International Reporting Standards, right, you have different costs get reported in cost of goods sold as opposed to operating expense. So, while the total doesn't change, it's just a shift, higher gross margins and the offset is in operating expenses. We anticipated that Rhiag would be at like an 11% EBITDA margin. When we announced the transaction back in December, they were north of that. For the second quarter, there is seasonality to their business. As an example, there is \u2013 in their Italian business, there's three less working days in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. In the Czech Republic, there's two less days. And so the fourth quarter which traditionally is a little bit softer in our European businesses, you're going to see that with Rhiag as well.","So one key thing, and this is true with PGW as well, is there have been no changes to the annual plans for either Rhiag or PGW. We are very confident that the accretion expectations that we set forth when we announced those transactions will absolutely occur. Again, there's a little bit of shift between the quarters with Q2 being a really good quarter for both those entities. And so the benefits will be a little bit less in Q3 and Q4. But again, we're thrilled with how both the big acquisitions are performing under the first quarter or so of our ownership.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Ben, I just want to add one more thing to what Nick said on the Rhiag deal, we announced that we, in my prepared remarks, I said we did 11 branch openings. We're going to do an additional 20 to 25 in the back half of the year as well because we're so pleased with the way the acquisition's going. So it's going to mimic a lot of what we did at ECP, the year we bought that as well. So very pleased with that acquisition.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","That's great. That helps. And then just last one for me, if I think about the implications of Brexit, obviously, it's pretty nebulous at this point, but how do you think that impacts your acquisition strategy abroad, if at all?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, a couple comments on Brexit, we do see likely an increase in cost of goods coming into the UK. However, because of the devaluation of this pound sterling, we do expect all of our competitors to face that obviously. So we expect to pass that through. In terms of the acquisition strategy, as I mentioned and Nick mentioned as well, we're going to keep building out the Rhiag network through greenfields. And we will look for acquisitions as well. Likely, probably going to turn down a little bit, we expect some of the sellers might pull back and wait for the smoke to clear a little bit. But we are watching and we think it's an opportunity to continue and grow the business.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Bret.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey, is there a way to look at the North American growth, sort of breaking out traffic versus ticket maybe? Is there any trend either on inflation or deflation in pricing? And\/or change in penetration of alternative parts? Just trying to get a feeling for that, the drivers of organic?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So nothing that \u2013 none of the data that we analyzed on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, whether it's the number of calls we're receiving, the number of formal part request, the number of estimates, conversion rates, et cetera, et cetera, would suggest that there's any substantive changes in the market as a whole. The reality is, well in general, miles driven should correlate positively to collision activity, right, number of cars on the road. At the end of the day, the key metric is the number of accidents that actually occur. And it's been soft in the first half of the year.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I will add to what Nick said, Bret, that CCC did \u2013 we had a quarterly update from them on that chart that we have in our slide deck, our investor deck that shows the part penetration per estimate, another increase by the alternative parts industry for Q2. So continue to take market share from the OEs. I just think it's a \u2013 the result of just the lower claims volume right now. But when that returns to normal, I think we'll see the acceleration come back.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And then your comment about a top 10 carrier that you've added, obviously, not State Farm. Are there other top 10s that are under-indexed to alternative parts? We've all focused on State Farm but is there other share to gain there?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That was the last one that had half of the \u2013 or actually about three quarters of their company not writing and a quarter writing. So that's it other than State Farm of course. Allstate, when you take a company like Allstate, they only write certified parts and that's why we always highlight the number of certified parts hitting the marketplace. So they have limited use, in other words they won't write all parts. But everyone else on the top 10 are writing some form of alternative parts now, other than State Farm, on aftermarket.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And a last question, you mentioned PGW picked up an MSO renewal. What percentage of PGW's replacement glass business is through MSOs?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's pretty small actually, less than 2%.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thank you for taking the question and good morning, gentlemen.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jamie.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Jamie.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","I wanted to follow-up on sort of two key topics. So first you alluded to in your slides, and apologies if you went into more detail on the prepared remarks, I had to dial in a little bit late, apologies for that, you're buying fewer units for slightly higher dollars per unit, so higher quality vehicles and there's some expected follow through, I think, as we discussed in the past that you can maybe sell those parts for higher prices as well. Just wanted to get an update on that sort of theme and how it's playing out?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we are intentionally buying a better vehicle. It's slightly newer. Younger, I should say in age with that intent of \u2013 as that car part shifts to a newer car, Jamie, we want to have obviously newer model parts in the inventory. So it is going to plan. We are buying that younger vehicle and we are absolutely getting more gross margin dollars. We run a report here that it is showing that we are actually getting more dollars out of the same amount of cars.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","And as the Houston (52:55) operation improves, are you starting to see benefits of an inventory turn perspective as well?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not really. The inventory, historically, has turned about three times a year. There's no big changes there.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Got it. Okay and then...","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On a consolidated basis, it'll begin to turn a bit faster just because of PGW has a much higher turn, because their OE business has basically direct delivery to the assembly lines.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","And the PGW turns just from a housekeeping perspective, roughly you're saying that your core business is three times, what's PGW?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Order of six to seven times.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Got it. And then I mean there's clearly a lot on your plate with respect to Rhiag and PGW integration, the AlixPartners and Tamworth initiatives, so I don't want to sort of add more to your plate, but it does seem from some peer reports in the auto aftermarket that results have slowed or certainly decelerated on a comp store sales basis. And I'm wondering if that presents an opportunity for you, as you think about other North American verticals, whether that's wholesale channels or other sort of larger acquisition opportunities. And I know you discussed that, it was a later decade sort of endeavor but wondering if you're pulling forward that or thinking about pulling that forward, at all?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think that's fair Jamie. It is opening up new opportunities for us, particularly in the accessories space. Those vertical moves \u2013 we have a lot of opportunities there to expand that size of the business. We are not in the reman transmission business today. We think that's a great opportunity for us. So we are looking at those opportunities very closely now.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. I appreciate the additional color and best of luck in the next quarter.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Just wanted to ask you guys just a clarification question. I know you're a little downbeat the weather trends curtailed some of the U.S. growth in the first half. But it seems like you're excited about and pleased how PGW performed in the last two months of the quarter since the end of April when you took it in your operations. Is it reasonable to assume, by that, that you're seeing parts and service business kind of the traditional parts ex-glass perform well in May and June, maybe better than what you saw in the first, call it, four months of the year? And, if anything, it's hard to believe that the glass business could be doing really well and then the component part of the business not doing so well?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, John, PGW was \u2013 had a really good contribution to the quarter. Again, they haven't changed their overall projections for the year, their budgets or their plans. So they're right on target. That's a combination of both the aftermarket business and the OE business. Obviously, the OE business plays to different dynamics than our historical businesses if you will. The reality is they're very \u2013 they're different, right. And the drivers of our core North American business are different than the core drivers of the PGW business.","Again, we think our core North American business had a great quarter. I mean the margins were up. Gross margins were up. Operating margins were up. Profitability was up nicely. Yeah, the organic growth was a little bit lower than I think was expected. But given what was happening with total, the frequency of collisions, I mean all put together, we think we had a terrific first quarter in North America.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John, I'll just add to what Nick said with the PGW acquisition. We are starting to sell glass in our LKQ facilities. So those reps have access to that. So, yeah, we are \u2013 we do like that the \u2013 certainly, the distribution side of the business, to be able to cross-sell in our different entities. We're looking at opportunities in Europe as well. So we're very pleased with that acquisition.","John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. And then I just wanted to ask, you gave the statistic about the benefit you're getting out of the sales force productivity, I think you said 17 calls or 17.2 calls going to 18 calls maybe. Where do you ultimately see that going to over time? And how much productivity do you think that you can really drive from an external sales standpoint amongst the sales force?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the biggest benefit we think we can get is just training. By consolidating our call centers and getting our people better trained and better monitored is the ultimate goal here. We talked about the CCC initiative where more and more is going online as an opportunity as well. So we just see just more effectiveness with our sales reps and just being able to better handle called line (58:19) as well. The way we're situated now with sales reps spread out all over, we now have the ability to move our phones. If the phones go down, we can move it to a different call center.","We do plan on going to extended hours so that at 5 in the morning if someone on the West Coast wanted to order a part, if they're up early, those will ring on the East Coast. And when we close down at 5 o'clock in the East Coast, those calls will be ringing on the West Coast. So we expect expanded service because of the way we're going to be routing the calls and handling the sales force. So we do expect some good efficiencies to come out of this.","John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please proceed with your question.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Just back to the North American market again, is it possible to separate the percent of revenue generated from collision versus mechanical repair?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Collision today is roughly 30% of our total revenue.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And how about the performance of that 30% for North America in the quarter?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The \u2013 again, I think the question you're asking is collision, kind of performance of collision versus mechanical?","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Just the North American, I'm just trying to flesh out the collision performance versus the rest of the business there?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The collision side actually performed a little bit better than mechanical. I mean the two biggest parts we take off of a salvage vehicle is obviously the engine and the transmission. On the aftermarket side, we saw no mechanical. So mechanical strictly relates to the salvage side of the business.","The reality is those parts start selling kind of year seven or so. If you take a look at the request that we get for engines and transmissions, about 15% of the total request relate to model years that are one to six years old. 65% of the requests come from model years that are seven to 15 years old.","And so the kind of the sweet spot for the mechanical side, yeah, are older vehicles, and as \u2013 the strong SAAR rate over the last several years, it's going to take some time before those cars come in to the sweet spot on the mechanical side. So a little bit stronger performance on the collision versus the mechanical. But nothing \u2013 not significant.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And what is the approximate annual revenue generated from the UK collision market?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's annualizing roughly about $80 million now.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Thanks very much.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wagman for closing comments.","Robert L.

Hopefully, everyone had a chance to look at our 8-K which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the next few days.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level full-year 2016 financial results, followed by an update on our operating segments. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance in Q4 and our guidance for 2017.","For full-year 2016, revenue reached $8.58 billion, an increase of 19.3%, as compared to $7.19 billion for full year of 2015. This number excludes revenue from PGW's OEM glass manufacturing business whose planned divesture was announced in Q4. Nick will provide the overall financial impacts of this transaction shortly. Net income for full-year 2016 was $464 million, an increase of 9.6%, as compared to $423.2 million for 2015. Diluted earnings per share for full-year 2016 was $1.50, an increase of 8.7%, as compared to $1.38 for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.80, an increase of 20.8%, as compared to $1.49 for 2015.","For the full year of 2016, parts and services organic revenue growth was 4.8% and acquisition revenue growth was 19%, while the impact of exchange rates was negative 2.5%, for total parts and service revenue growth of 21.3%. Adjusting for differences in selling days during the fourth quarter of 2016, the company achieved global organic growth of 5.2% on a per day basis.","Turning to our North American operations, adjusted for having one less selling day, our North American segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3% during the fourth quarter, performance consistent with what we've witnessed throughout all of 2016.","For full-year 2016, North America had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 2.9%, which is 40 basis points above the full year 2.5% collision and liability-related auto claims reported by CCC. It's important to note that when looking at our North America growth, there continued to be variations across the platform. There were geographic differences with the Central and West regions continuing to perform much better than our Northeast and Midwest regions where we witnessed mild weather conditions.","In wholesale aftermarket, certain part types like our core Keystone fenders, hoods, bumpers, and lights grew faster than the overall North America growth rate, while paint and related products, cooling products and aluminum wheels experienced year-over-year declines. So, there were definite spots of strength and spots of weakness.","As we enter 2017, we are implementing additional programs targeted at specific product lines and making some adjustments to the sales organization, all in an effort to drive improvement in the growth metrics. During Q4, we acquired 77,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 4.1% increase over Q4 2015.","For full-year 2016, procurement of dismantling vehicles was 291,000, a slight increase over 2015. For our North American aftermarket parts business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.8% and 17.8% respectively in 2016.","This trend validates our suppliers' commitment of investing in the development of new tools to manufacture aftermarket parts to support the growth in SAAR and related new model designs.","In our self service retail business, during Q4, we acquired 129,000 lower-cost self service and crush only cars, which is a 14.5% increase over Q4 2015. For full-year 2016, vehicle procurement was 524,000, an increase of 11.3% from 2015.","Turning to the 2016 results of our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC. The revenue and number of purchase orders processed through the CCC platform during 2016 grew 66% and 63% respectively year-over-year. On an annualized basis, the revenue from this initiative is now tracking over $47 million.","Lastly, I am pleased with the progress of our Roadnet productivity initiative. Since inception, we have been able to increase miles per route from 101 to 129, allowing us to cover eight stops per miles driven versus a previous average of six without any significant increase in head count.","At the end of 2016, Roadnet was operating at 319 locations across North America with 3,900 vehicles traveling 9.6 million miles per month across a network of 74,000 routes and making 1.1 million stops per month. During his presentation, Nick will discuss the financial benefit of our overall productivity initiative realized in 2016 and their projected impact in 2017.","Now, moving to our European operations. In 2016, our Europe segment had solid organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.2% with limited contribution from new branch openings, and acquisition growth of 47.1% primarily related to Rhiag. This growth was offset by a decrease of 7.9% related to foreign exchange rates.","For full-year 2016, ECP continued its impressive track record of delivering strong organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8.1%. For branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 6.6%. This performance is particularly impressive in the midst of all the market uncertainty surrounding Brexit.","In addition, collision parts sales at ECP continued their double-digit growth, posting 15.4% in 2016. Operationally, the collision team had a busy 2016, which included entering the Republic of Ireland with our paint business and the integration of six UK paint locations into existing ECP branches.","This integration will produce synergies with a shared fleet and will provide a collaborative sales approach between our collision parts specialists and our paint sales advisors to target and service the body shop requirements with a one-stop shop solution. Today, we offer over 18,000 unique collision SKUs to both the UK and the Republic of Ireland.","With respect to the T2 project, I am pleased with our continued progress. We expect to begin testing the T2 automation in Q2. Once the automation process is solidified, we plan on starting deliveries in early Q3 and to be fully live in Q1 of 2018 for ECP's base business. This project continues to be both on budget and on schedule.","Regarding Andrew Page, the UK Competition and Markets Authority continues to review the acquisition and assess whether transaction would be \u2013 would unreasonably lessen competition in the UK market.","With that, we do expect this transaction to have a dilutive impact on 2017 earnings. With the number of licensed vehicles in the UK and overall traffic levels reaching an all-time high in 2016, and the inevitable ageing of the UK car park, ECP is very well positioned to continue their growth with their extensive network, robust product offerings, and the opening of T2 in 2018.","Turning to our Sator business. In 2016, Sator achieved organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.5%, the highest annual rate since we acquired this business in 2013. Also, since acquiring the business, Sator achieved their highest annual margins in 2016. This ongoing performance is a clear validation of our strategy to convert their network to a two-step distribution model, the expansion of their existing product lines, and the leveraging of procurement synergies with ECP and now with Rhiag.","And with respect to Rhiag, it continues to track in line with our expectations. We opened an additional eight branches during the quarter, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, bringing the total, since acquisition, to 28. Importantly, and as I mentioned on the last call, we continue to aggressively gather the necessary data and communication plan amongst our European businesses with the objective of implementing a targeted and sustainable Pan-European procurement function.","Now, on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment posted year-over-year total revenue growth of 13.5% in 2016, including the benefits of The Coast acquisition and an impressive organic revenue growth of 6.9%.","During 2016, the Specialty team continued to focus on streamlining fulfillment processes, route optimization, ensuring best-in-class inventory availability, and expanding product and service offerings including dealer-friendly online solutions. This focus enabled our Specialty segment to generate their best EBITDA margin since the company entered this segment in 2013.","Now, turning to the glass business. As previously mentioned, on December 19, 2016, we announced the sale of our OEM glass manufacturing business to a subsidiary of Vitro. The results of our OEM glass manufacturing business are reported in discontinued operations for 2016.","Importantly, this divestiture will allow our team to focus on the existing aftermarket glass distribution business and the synergies that exist with our North American aftermarket locations and customer base. Going forward, the aftermarket replacement glass or ARG will be combined with our North American segment from an operating perspective.","To understand the synergy opportunities and facility overlap, please turn to slide 8 in our earnings deck, which highlights the ARG locations in relations to our \u2013 the existing aftermarket locations. For 2017, we are projecting integration of nine ARG locations into LKQ existing wholesale warehouses and adding three new satellite locations into our existing network.","And now, turning to corporate development. On December 1, 2016, the company acquired a 26.5% equity interest in Mekonomen Group from Axel Johnson. Headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, Mekonomen Group is the leading independent car parts and service chain in the Nordic region of Europe. Mekonomen will remain independent of LKQ's existing European operations. However, we look forward to exploring, together with Mekonomen's management, areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner. Following the announcement of this investment on January 10, 2017, Joe Holsten and John Quinn were appointed to the Mekonomen Board of Directors.","In addition to the previously mentioned acquisition of Andrew Page and our investment in Mekonomen, during the fourth quarter of 2016, LKQ acquired a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in the Netherlands, a salvage yard in Sweden, a distributor of automotive paint products in Pennsylvania, and three heavy-duty truck aftermarket radiator distributors in the U.S.","Also in the fourth quarter, LKQ's European operations opened two new Euro Car Part branches in United Kingdom and eight new branches in Eastern Europe.","At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our 2017 guidance.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Rob. And good morning to everybody on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our guidance for 2017.","In December, we announced we had entered into an agreement to sell the OEM operations of the PGW business. And with that, the accounting rules require us to do several things that make the fourth quarter results a bit confusing. So, I will spend a little less time on the segment results, which I set forth in the presentation, and I will spend a bit more time trying to get everybody on the same page in understanding the correct apples-to-apples comparisons.","The sale of the OEM business, which is slated to close on February 28, requires us to treat the OEM activities of PGW as a discontinued operation, and thereby, eliminating the related OEM revenue and expenses from the consolidated totals both for the quarter and for the year as a whole.","So, the revenue and expense line item amounts shown in our income statement include the aftermarket replacement glass side of PGW, which we refer to as ARG, but exclude the OEM side. The impact of the OEM business is netted down to a single line item on the income statement labeled Income from Discontinued Operations.","In arriving at the OEM income, under U.S. GAAP, 100% of the costs related to any person or expense item that had some involvement with the aftermarket business during the year, regardless how limited, had to be recorded as continuing operations even though the people and\/or expenses are actually going to Vitro as part of the sale.","So, even though most of the PGW officers like the President, CFO, Heads of HR and IT, et cetera, and most of the Finance IT and HR teams will be employees of Vitro after the sale, 100% of their costs since the acquisition date are recorded as part of ARG and included in continuing operations. So, it will appear that the OEM business is more profitable and the ARG business less profitable than how their respective businesses will actually perform post-closing, everything else being equal.","Next, even though the sale has not closed in Q4, we needed to record a non-cash charge reflecting the difference between the anticipated sale proceeds and the book value of the assets of the OEM business. In our 8-K filing last December, we highlighted a probable loss of $25 million to $35 million, and we came in near the lower end of that range at $27 million on a pre-tax basis. The after-tax impact of the loss is netted against the OEM operating income and is included in the line titled Income from Discontinued Operations.","Finally, you will note that we have eliminated the glass segment from our line of business reporting. Due to differences between the glass manufacturing business and our prior lines of business, we have been reporting the entire glass business as a separate segment.","With the sale of the OEM business, the aftermarket glass operations will be melded into our North American aftermarket management structure. Importantly, as Rob noted, we are in the process of physically integrating a handful of existing PGW aftermarket branches into LKQ aftermarket warehouses, and anticipate more of that to come over the next few years.","So, while ARG represents a new product, it's basically the same business, the distribution of aftermarket auto parts sold and delivered to repair shops. And the business now reports up to Justin Jude, our Senior Vice President of North American Wholesale Operations. With all that, the glass business no longer qualifies as a separate reportable segment and is now part of North American operations.","Since the margin structure of the ARG business is slightly different than our historical North American businesses, some of the year-over-year margin changes in the North American segment simply reflect a mix shift in the addition of glass, and I will try to point out the impact of those changes as we go through this discussion.","Revenue for the ARG business will continue to be accounted as acquired revenue until the anniversary of the acquisition at the end of April, at which point in time, it will be folded into the North American organic growth metric.","So, now onto our results. The fourth quarter of 2016, when taken as a whole, was an excellent quarter. Organic growth for parts and services in the fourth quarter was right in the middle of the range we discussed during our last call, and adjusted earnings per share fell right on top of the consensus estimates of the analysts who cover our company.","Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 23% over last year. That reflects a 23.5% increase in revenue from parts and services, the components of which include approximately 3.8% from organic growth plus 23.5% from acquisitions, for constant currency growth of 27.3%, before backing out the translation impact of FX which was a 3.8% decline.","Remember, we had one less selling day in 2016 compared to last year. So, on a same day basis, the organic growth was 5.2%. The OEM sale does not impact any of the metrics for organic growth in parts and services, as all of the PGW revenue fell in the acquired revenue bucket in 2016.","As noted on slide 13 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 130 basis points to 38.6% due primarily to the impact of the big acquisitions. You will recall that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses.","While consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also down by about 80 basis points lower than last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the two acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses.","Segment EBITDA totaled $222 million for the quarter, reflecting a 15% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 10.3%, a 70-basis-point decline from the 11% recorded last year.","Depreciation and amortization was up about $22 million, mostly related to the acquisitions; and the same holds true for interest expense which was up by about $11 million.","With that, pre-tax income in the quarter was up 3.1%. Our effective tax rate during the fourth quarter was 32.9%, up from the 30.4% in Q4 of 2015. This reflects a base rate of 34.75% and the benefit of a few discrete items.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter, including the impact of the loss on sale, was $0.28, which was down 9.7% compared to last year. Importantly, adjusted EPS, excluding restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, the adoption of the new accounting rule related to the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, and a variety of other non-recurring gains and losses, was $0.39 in 2016 compared to $0.34 last year, reflecting a 15% improvement.","The $0.39 was comprised of $0.35 a share from continuing operations and $0.04 from discontinued operations. Again, continuing operations include certain overhead costs that will be transferred with the sale of the OEM glass business.","As anticipated, during the Q3 call, currency fluctuations negatively impacted earnings per share in the fourth quarter for continuing operations by about $0.02, and the acquisition of Andrew Page had a $0.02-drag on earnings during Q4 which was a touch higher than initially anticipated.","For the year, diluted earnings per share was $1.50 a share. And adjusted EPS was right on top of the consensus estimates of $1.80 a share, comprised of $1.69 from continuing operations and $0.11 from discontinued operations. The impact of the costs allocated to continuing operations that will be gone with the sale of the OEM business was about $0.03 a share.","And with that, let's briefly touch on the segments. In North America, total revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 increased to $1,114 million or a 9.4% increase over the last year. This is the combination of a 9% growth rate in parts and services and a 14% increase in other revenue. The total parts and services growth included organic growth of 1.5% and acquisition growth of 7.4% primarily related to the aftermarket glass business. The organic metric was reflective of the one less selling day. And on a constant day basis, the organic growth in North America parts and services was 3% during Q4.","Gross margins in North America at the end of fourth quarter of 2016 were 43.4%, a 20-basis-point improvement over last year. We continue to benefit from the procurement initiatives in our aftermarket collision parts business and improvements at our salvage and self service operations, which collectively contributed to an 80-basis-point increase in North American gross margins. On the other side, the inclusion of the aftermarket glass operations, which have lower gross margins than the rest of North America, had a 60-basis-point negative impact on the segment's gross margins.","In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the fourth quarter of 2016 was $140 million. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 12.5% in Q4 of 2016, down 30 basis points from the 12.8% reported in the comparable period of the prior year. Importantly, the margins for our historical North American businesses, excluding glass, increased 110 basis points and reflected the highest fourth quarter EBITDA margins in the last five years.","So, while the growth was a bit lower than we would prefer, we are making great strides in terms of controlling costs and increasing margins. In total, we estimate that the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the fourth quarter was approximately $9.3 million, up from the $8.6 million in the third quarter of this year.","The inclusion of the aftermarket glass operations had a 140-basis-point negative impact on North American EBITDA margins, in part, due to the inclusion of the allocated overhead costs that will disappear post-closing. So, we're up 110 basis points in our historical businesses, down a negative 140 basis points from glass for a net impact of down 30 bps.","Moving onto our European segment, total revenue in the fourth quarter accelerated to $779 million, a 60% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the fourth quarter was 7.2% on a reported basis, reflecting the combination of 8.4% at ECP and 2.6% growth at Sator.","On a same day basis, European organic growth was 8.3%. The impact of acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 66% increase in revenue with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So, on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 73% in the fourth quarter.","This constant currency revenue increases were offset, in part, by a 13% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling.","As you can see on slide 21, the average rate during the quarter was about 18% below last year, and the sterling was at about $1.25 at year-end. More recently, the sterling has continued to trade in the $1.21 to $1.27 range, while the euro has fallen to about $1.05 from $1.10. The translation impacts of these FX rates will weigh on our 2017 results, which I will quantify in just a bit.","Gross margins in Europe were 36.1%, compared to the 38.9% recorded in the comparable period of 2015, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag in the 2016 results. Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. And during Q4 of 2016, the inclusion of Rhiag reduced the consolidated European gross margins by about 190 basis points compared to last year.","European EBITDA totaled $64 million, a 34% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter of 2016 were 8.2% versus the 9.7% last year, a 150-basis-point decline, of which about 30 basis points relate to the incremental costs associated with the Tamworth project, some of which was recorded in cost of goods sold and some of which was in SG&A, and then a 110-basis-point decline related to losses at Andrew Page.","Again, the incremental costs related to the Tamworth project in Q4 were approximately \u00a31.6 million or about $2 million, and again, it reflects a negative 30 basis points' impact on the European margins.","Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $259 million, a 5.7% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015, all of which reflected organic growth, which was up from the 3.7% reported in Q3. On a same day basis, organic growth in Specialty was 7.4%.","Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the fourth quarter were down about 220 basis points compared to last year, primarily related to the timing of advertising credits and costs related to stocking of the two new distribution centers brought online in 2016.","EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $19 million which was up 28% from Q4 of 2015. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 130 basis points to 7.4% in 2016, due largely to improved efficiencies in SG&A, which more than offset the lower gross margins. This is a highly seasonal business with the Q4 always being the softest. For the year, EBITDA margins for the Specialty business was the highest in the three years we've owned these operations, reflecting the integration benefits of the tuck-in acquisitions.","Now, let' move to capital allocation. As presented on slide 24, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from continuing operations during 2016 was approximately $571 million. During 2016, we deployed a little more than $2.2 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $183 million to fund capital expenditures and approximately $1.8 billion to acquire businesses and make strategic investments like our minority ownership position in Mekonomen. We closed the quarter with approximately $227 million of cash, of which $175 million was held outside of the United States, and we had roughly $3.3 billion worth of total debt outstanding.","So, our net debt was approximately $3.1 billion; and on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our net leverage was approximately 2.7 times the latest 12-month EBITDA. We intend to use the $310 million of proceeds from the OEM sale to repay balances on our revolving line of credit, so our net debt should continue to decline.","At quarter-end, the total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1 billion. And with the sale of the OEM business, we will have just over $1.3 billion of availability which we believe is sufficient to support the continued growth of our business.","Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2017. To be clear, these metrics exclude the OEM glass business and reflect the activity from continuing operations only. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we have set guidance at 4% to 6%, which we believe is very good relative to other automotive parts distributors.","Importantly, 2016 was a leap year, which means we have one less selling day in 2017, and that will hit the reported full year for about 0.5% of growth. For those building quarterly models, the one fewer day actually falls in Q3 and will result in approximately a negative 1.5% impact on the reported growth rate during that quarter. Given the year that we've been through, we are tempering expectations for North American growth to the 2% to 4% range. Importantly, Q1 growth will be lower than the year as a whole, as some of the trends from 2016 have continued into the beginning of 2017.","Our range for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is from $1.80 to $1.90 a share with a midpoint of $1.85, reflecting a 10% growth rate over the earnings per share of $1.69 from continuing operations recorded in 2016. There are a number of discrete items influencing the 2017 EPS guidance, so in an effort to bridge the year-over-year growth, we've included a new slide, number 28, which is a bridge from our actual 2016 results to the midpoint of our 2017 guidance range.","For purposes of a simplified presentation, we show each bridge item as a point estimate, but in reality, there's a range of potential impact for each item. The biggest uptick, about $0.17 a share, relates to the continued growth of our businesses. We will also benefit by about $0.03 a share from owning Rhiag and the aftermarket glass business for the full year. As mentioned earlier, the carve-out accounting rules don't reflect how the PGW aftermarket business will be run post-sale, so relative to 2016, we will pick up about $0.03 a share by eliminating certain expenses included in the 2016 results from continuing operations that will move to the new owner. We will, however, give about $0.01 of that write-back in 2017, as we need to record the allocated overhead to continuing operations for the first two months of this year.","The next phase of the Tamworth build-out will cost an incremental $0.02 a share in 2017 compared to last year. Assuming current exchange rates hold for the year, the weakness of the European currencies relative to 2016 will clip us for yet another $0.03, and the losses at Andrew Page will amount to an incremental $0.01 or more decline on a year-over-year basis.","Importantly, the positive items on the bridge are permanent in nature, while the items having a negative impact are more transitory in nature. It's also worth pointing out that when thinking about the year-over-year comparisons, the negative impact related to FX will be felt more in the first half of the year. And again, we have to include the allocated PGW expenses in the first two months of 2017, and that $0.01 headwind will hit us in Q1.","The net income associated with the EPS range is $560 million to $590 million, and assumes an effective tax rate of 34.75%. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $610 million to $640 million, and the guidance for capital spending is $200 million to $225 million.","To be clear, the 2017 guidance assumes pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.25 and $1.05 respectively. And importantly, that scrap remains at the current levels of about $150 a ton.","For consistency, we would ask that all the analysts adjust their models to be on a continuing operations basis. And to help get things on an apples-to-apples comparison, appendix number 5 on slide 39 provides quarterly data for 2016 reflecting the performance of our continuing operations only.","At this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Nick. In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication of our 40,000-plus employees delivered for the company, our stockholders, and most importantly, our customers in 2016. I am equally proud of our teams' commitment to deliver continued growth in 2017. This focus allows us to project solid EPS gains for 2017 with the midpoint of our guidance representing a 10% increase over the comparable 2016 EPS results.","With that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Ali Faghri from SIG. Your line is now open.","Ali Faghri - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ali.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning.","Ali Faghri - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Can you talk about the cadence of North American organic growth trends through the quarter? And then, maybe as a quick follow-up, you mentioned continued geographic differences in performance between certain regions in the U.S., did you see that performance gap between those regions close at all in the fourth quarter relative to last quarter?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, I'll let Nick talk about the cadence over the four quarters but let me just touch, Ali, on what we saw on organic growth, and I also want to talk about the sales initiatives that we have in place for this year. From the data we have from CCC, the weather was clearly an impact. For 2016, CCC reported claims volumes up 2.5% versus 4.6% in 2015. So, there was a definite decline.","We did some studies on our top 20 states that we do business in, which is the lion's share of the population. They were up 1.3% compared to our 2.9% increase, so we're definitely seeing some momentum in the right places. There are regional differences that continue to this day, the West and the Central are definitely doing better than Northeast and Midwest. The core business though of our hoods, fenders, lamps, covers were all higher than our overall North American, again across. So, I am convinced when collision returns to normalized levels, we will reap the benefits. We're well positioned for inventory as soon as all those collisions start coming back.","I do want to touch quickly on total losses, those were up 18.8%. From a few years ago, they're about 16%. We do expect that to plateau though as these newer cars come into the process. So, total losses cut both ways for us. Obviously, the cars don't get repaired, but that's how we require our inventory. So, a healthy total loss rate isn't a bad thing for us either.","And the last thing I'd say, just on the acquisition \u2013 on the organic growth rate, just from acquisition financials, our pipeline still remains robust. We're seeing this as an industry issue. We're seeing some pretty soft financials come into the M&A. So, we do anticipate this to turn around, and I'll take this time just to talk about those sales initiatives I mentioned in my prepared remarks.","One of the big things we're going to be doing is moving from a transactional pay to a customer result for our sales reps. So, instead of getting a commission on every single sale they make, they'll be tied to a customer and the growth of that customer. So, this brings us more to a proactive rather than a reactive approach with our customer base. We've always had a customer focus, however, this raises the bar for our sales reps to drive that revenue on a customer basis.","Our goal obviously is to get more of the wallet of their share \u2013 wallet share of that customer's purchases. But we do expect, if we're successful at this, we'll also improve our operational costs because we're delivering more to the same customer. As part of that, as I just mentioned, we're looking to get better inventory fill rates, and balancing our inventory as necessary. I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well the success we've had with Roadnet, that's going to allow us to increase our delivery service, so provide better service. And the final thing we plan on doing is targeted pricing for those product lines that are a little soft for us. We're going to go after those customers. Nick, do you want to talk about the cadence?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Sure, Ali. It's \u2013 it was a little bit unusual, we started off the quarter \u2013 and I think your question was how do things roll from October to December. You recall that at the very beginning of the quarter, the Southeast got hit with the hurricane, and that clearly had an impact on our growth in October, particularly in the Southeast region, which is actually down on a year-over-year basis for the quarter as a whole. Things picked up a bit in \u2013 obviously, in November and December. We can't quantify exactly the impact of the hurricane. We do know it had negative impact on the results for the quarter and particularly in October. But I wouldn't say that there was a big acceleration from October to December when you try and adjust everything out, if that's helpful.","Ali Faghri - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","It is. Great. Thanks for all that color. So, just to be clear, you're guiding North America to 2% to 4% growth in 2017, it sounds like you're saying probably closer to the low end of that range in the first half of the year and maybe improving throughout the year, is that the right way to look at it?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","That's right way to look at it, yes.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Absolutely.","Ali Faghri - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Hey, thanks for taking my questions as well. Just wanted to ask that North American question in a slightly different way, but we saw reports from Copart and Insurance Auto Auction yesterday showing a surge in activity at salvage auctions, and that's driven by distracted driving and other factors. So, help us reconcile that trend with the soft trends you're seeing. I realize there are regional differences and maybe a change in the totalled frequency, but maybe just for investors trying to reconcile that, what would your explanation be?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, Craig, I think the answer is that it \u2013 we're totalling an older car. We get stats from CCC that show older cars are definitely totalling. We still have an average model year of 11.5 years old, it doesn't take much to total that car. The volume at auctions is definitely up. We'd track that on a weekly basis. And they are surging for sure, but it is an older car, it appears.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","And the higher the total loss rate goes, that means those cars are not getting repaired and we can't sell parts to help repair those vehicles.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up, get you on record if I could, on the border adjustment tax proposal, I realize there are lots of different proposals out there and who knows what's going to pass, but how have you positioned yourselves for tax policy changes and what issue should we anticipate?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, Craig, the reality is the border tax proposals and the like are incredibly vague and incredibly complex. So, we really can't put a number on it. Here is what I can tell you, that between our aftermarket and our specialty businesses, we purchase about $1.3 billion worth of product that is manufactured outside of the United States. But there is about $500 million of that, that we actually procure from the U.S. subsidiaries of those foreign suppliers. So, only $800 million is actually purchased from non-U.S. companies. So, with respect to the $500 million, it's absolutely unclear as to who would get hit with the theoretical border tax, if you will.","The reality is, in the parts that we procure, there are not a lot of U.S. domestic suppliers that we can turn to, to acquire the volumes that we need to service our customers. The other part of the border tax is a lower corporate tax rate of 20%. Included in that is immediate deductibility of capital expenditures. Of the $225 million of CapEx, about $140 million of that is really U.S. based. So, that would help move things in the other direction.","But again, there is \u2013 it's so unclear, it's almost impossible to quantify the real impact on the business.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","And let me just add, Craig, one of our largest manufacturer actually overseas does have manufacturing capacity here in the U.S. And we had a team over there last week talking to them that in the event there are some taxes imposed that they would ramp up production here in the U.S. So, we are actively looking at alternatives should that happen. But the other piece of good news is that the OEs are actively against this and have been very vocal about it. So, I think they have the same exposure we do. So, all in all, it could be an even playing field at the end of the day.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's really helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Hey, Ben.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","I have \u2013 just one point of clarity on the incremental Tamworth cost of $0.02, is that on top of the prior $0.07 to $0.09 you were expecting when you initially discussed the dilution associated with that? Or is it on top of the dilution you experienced last year?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","It's on top of the dilution experienced last year, so we think that at the end of the day, the overall kind of duplicative cost over the span of the project will be less than we originally anticipated back in the summer of 2015 when we've put this on the radar screen for everybody.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up to that. You had alluded before that you would see accretion in 2018, are we close enough to 2018 to where you can take a stab at what you think that level of accretion could look like?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","No, it's going to really depend on how quickly we can kind of turn down the two facilities that we're going to ultimately close because that's where the benefit is going to come from. We will be \u2013 at that point in time, in January of 2018, we'll be fully staffed up and running at T2. And then, we will ultimately close the facilities, either transfer or eliminate labor at the two other facilities, and obviously save the lease payments as well.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks so much. And then, if I could ask a question about the organic growth disparities between geographies, do you think you've seen enough normalized weather coupled with the comparisons from last year, such that you would expect those gaps to close as we move into the balance of 2017? Maybe just help us think about that comparison year-over-year.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, two days ago, here in Chicago, it was 75 degrees. And this morning when I came in to work, it was 55. So, the normalization of the winter weather has not been even across the country. And so, my expectation is, particularly like in the Midwest which seems to be having really May weather here in February, we're not going to get much of an uplift, if you will. Obviously, the \u2013 essentially, the significant rains out West down in the Texas area, that should help us out. So, my expectation is we're going to continue to see regional differences from a growth perspective. But, Rob, you may...","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. I would just add to that, Ben, that we track miles driven by regions, and the Northeast in December was negative 1.4, and the North Central was negative 2.3. So, it seems like it's going to be a little soft, but we do hit some softer comps in the back half, so we're cautiously optimistic.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. And just one last quick one from me. Is the repayment of debt with the proceeds from the OE sale of glass business, is that reflected in the EPS guidance?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","It is.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. Best of luck.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Ben.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I did want to go to...","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Samik.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, Rob. I did want to go back to the North America parts and service organic growth, and you're guiding to 2% to 4% in 2017 for organic growth. It will be interesting to know how you're thinking about how this impacts long term the growth for that business. Do you think there are headwinds here that sort of persist for a few years, and hence, impacts \u2013 Rob, I believe you've said in the past that you're sort of looking at this business being a mid-single digit grower, but do you think this impacts about how you think about this longer term as well? And maybe just a quick follow-up on that, the sales initiative that you're working on, how long do those take to sort of kick in and deliver some improvement in the growth?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, the \u2013 on North America, I do have \u2013 I'm very bullish on the long term actually. The 2% to 4% this year is really related to what Nick just mentioned, Samik, just a minute ago about being soft weather that we've had, so far, this month certainly in Chicago and across the North. So, now I do believe the macro trends are definitely in our favor. We've had a strong SAAR rate for a couple years. Those cars are going to get to be four or five years old and really come into the sweet spot. You've got miles driven for the most part increasing, a later-model car park is going to be fully insured. The cars are much higher valued, so much more difficult to total. So, I think long term, we're fine. And the number of cars hitting our sweet spot are starting to increase. So, the macro tailwinds are definitely in our favor for the outlier years.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And any color on how long does it typically take, in your experience, for the sales initiatives to sort of gather pace in terms of delivering some growth?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, we're starting roll those out as we speak. So, I think we'll start to hopefully see some positive impacts here in the back half of the year.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And then, on Andrew Page, you've started to include it in your guidance for 2017, is there any updated thoughts that you have on how many of those branches that you intend to keep? Is there a cash bent towards restructuring some of the branches there, any color on that?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, let me give you an update on Page. We are still under the hold separate order. However, we do have limited contact now with the Andrew Page management team, and we're assisting in procurement, fleet management, and the back-office. What we're prohibited from doing is sharing market plans or pricing. So, to answer your question, it's a little hard to figure out which branches, what we'll close, what we'll keep. But we are, from a 35,000-foot view, analyzing that. The biggest problem they had was that many suppliers had cut them off. So, while their overhead costs had remained flat, revenue was negatively impacted by the lack of inventory.","So, with ECP's help over the last couple months, we were able to stabilize the business, reestablish those supply agreements, and improve the fleet logistics in the internal controls. Now, that it's stabilized, the Andrew Page team is looking to rightsize the cost structure. The full integration and synergy capture can't occur until we get the release from the CMA. So, to comment on how many locations we'll keep, it's a little early still to be able to do that.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Great. Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thank you and good morning, gentlemen.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Jamie.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Jamie.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","It just seems like it's the right thing to do. So, let's keep the ball rolling on North America. Look, we get a lot of questions in a lot of different ways, and some of those have been asked already. The way I want to look at this is strictly speaking from a residual value perspective. What's your view \u2013 you mentioned loss ratios, you have a view on that. How do residual values play into your outlook? And to the extent \u2013 really what I'm focused on is not so much the 11-year-old-beyond vehicle that might get total loss, as Rob alluded to earlier. At the earlier part of the curve, you've got vehicles with much more expensive content, whether it's headlights that are significantly more expensive, taillights with blind spot detection or what have you. And I'm wondering, if residual values were to fall off, will insurance companies be more likely to sort of total loss those vehicles or is there a risk of that?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Sure. Absolutely. We believe we're strongly tied to the Manheim. Used car values, residual values, as cars, that diminishes, obviously it's much more easy to total a car. However, we do believe that the cost of these vehicles is substantial in these newer vehicles, that a lot of these cars are going to repair. I think the proliferation of a $3,000 headlight or taillights are still years away. I think we're still well-positioned, Jamie, to weather that storm. Talking to insurance companies, they don't believe they're going to see a huge spike in total losses because of that anytime soon.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. I mean, in general, the rule of thumb in the industry in every insurance company is a little bit different, as a car will get totalled when the cost to repair starts to get to around 65% of the value of the car. So, if the value of the car comes down because of used car pricings and the like, that could push a few more vehicles into the total camp than not. But when you have cars that are coming out that are very high-priced, it takes a boatload of damage to get to 65% of just that higher number.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","So, if I'm hearing you correctly, and I appreciate that additional color, the 65%, but it sounds like we're not near that pivot point from a strictly-speaking higher part perspective. But I guess as a follow-up to that, are you seeing OEMs act differently as they're becoming more aware that there's a \u2013 there could be a big market opportunity for them to supply those parts? And it does take some time, right, before the newest vehicles make their way to auctions and sort of off-warranty and whatnot, so any competitive sort of changes that you've seen would be helpful.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","We have not seen the OEMs do anything in terms of anything more aggressive quite frankly. We track their prices regularly, and we are still averaging that 1% to 1.5% increase in part prices. So, nothing abnormal from them at all.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. And if I can sneak one last one in, strategically on acquisitions, and thank you for the time. Just given the fact that you have seen some weakness and you've kind of benchmarked that for us, right, you said in certain markets, it's sort of worse than what you're reporting. And so, your spread is still, if I hear you correctly, holding up. But if the benchmarks are weakening, the markets are weakening, wouldn't that, in theory, sort of open up some acquisition opportunities for you? And I'm wondering, there's any \u2013 if you have eyes to maybe accelerate your plans to get into the mechanical parts business in North America in the near term? Thanks.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. I will say, that the pipeline is extremely robust, Jamie, it's \u2013 we get a weekly report from our M&A team of the status of our deals, and it's quite a spreadsheet now. So, there is quite a bit of activity there. As far as the hard part side of the business, we're continuing to look at opportunities there. As you know, we've been quite successful in Europe with our hard part strategy. In the UK, specifically, with the combination of collision and hard parts. So, it is absolutely on the radar for sure.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thank you again. And best of luck.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey, morning, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Hi, Bret.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","I got to get my North American question in. So, if we're looking, I guess, your comment about the softer first half of 2017 as a result of some residual issues from 2016, could you weight the residual weather versus the residual total loss increases in that impact, which one is more significant and sort of give us some buckets?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, that's really hard to do because at the end of the day, all we know is kind of what's happening from a repairable claim perspective, that was 2.5% increase for the year as a whole, the fourth quarter number was 2.8%. The reality is we don't sense that we're losing any share, kind of call volumes are consistent.","We do have some anecdotal information, Bret, in chatting with our vendors which we do all the time, right, and a couple of our largest providers of aftermarket parts over in Taiwan have told us that their non-LKQ sales last year were flat to down, which says that our competitors, if you will, were buying the same or even a little bit less aftermarket inventory, which is I think just reflective of the market and a relatively low increase in repairable claims. But it's almost impossible for us to split weather from other market trends.","The key, it's important I think the folks to understand is that the growth of the kind of the core products was higher than the 3% overall in the fourth quarter, okay, when you think about that core aftermarket product of hoods, fenders, mirrors, bumpers and the like. As some of these secondary products, the paints and the radiators and like where we've got some special programs being designed to attack that, they were actually down on a year-over-year basis. And so, our core kind of collision \u2013 your question, I think, really went to the trends in the core collision market, in those core collision products, we're more than holding our own and we think we're probably continuing to take a little bit of share.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","And then, let me just add, Bret, your comment about the auction and what we're seeing there. Q4 year-over-year, our salvage purchases were up 5.2% at $47 less a vehicle. So, that surge of inventory \u2013 like I said, it's allowing us to buy more inventory at a cheaper price, our self service was up 14% Q4-over-Q4. So, the inventory being available is not a bad thing for us.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, the highlight obviously ECP comps, the 12-month stores being up over 6%. What's going on over there, is that the market growth rate? Are you taking a lot of share ? And I guess, is that also benefiting from the collision mix that you're putting through those stores or is that separate?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. The collision was definitely helping because that is in the numbers as well. But we are definitely taking market share, and we believe the industry is growing likely GDP. Interesting enough, Brexit has not hurt us at all in terms of the driving population. In fact, they've coined the term staycations that the BRICS can't go to Europe because their dollar is not \u2013 the pounds is not travelling as farther. So, they're staying home. So, we're seeing miles driven up. We believe \u2013 we're very confident in ECPs continued growth in that marketplace.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Robert L.

","During the quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares of our stock for a total of $101 million, reflecting an average price of about $26 a share. Since we implemented the share repurchase program last October, our total repurchases have aggregated 13.2 million shares for a total of $352 million or an average price of approximately $26.66 a share. I am pleased to report that this week our Board approved an additional $500 million to the repurchase plan and extended the time period to October 2022. With that, we have almost $650 million of capacity under the amended plan.","As noted on Slide 5, revenue for the third quarter was $3.15 billion, and eight-tenths of 1% increase over the $3.12 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2018. Parts and services organic growth for the third quarter increased 2.3% on a reported basis, and when adjusting for one more selling day in each of our operating segments, the increase in organic revenue growth for parts and services was positive, nine-tenths of 1%. Acquisitions added eight-tenths of 1% of growth, while currencies had a negative impact of 2.3%. ","Net income was $152 million compared to the $134 million for the same period in 2018, an increase of 13% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.49 a share as compared to $0.42 for the same period of 2018, an increase of 17% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $189 million, an increase of 6% as compared to the $177 million for the same period last year. ","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.61, as compared to $0.56 for the same period of 2018, a 9% increase. We are pleased with the level of EPS growth considering the marginal uptick in revenue. ","Now let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7 organic revenue growth for parts and services in our North American segment was 2.9% in the quarter, a nice sequential uptick from Q2 and against a tough Q3 comp year-over-year. When adjusting for one more selling day in the quarter, North American organic revenue growth increased 1.4%, which was also a sequential uptick from Q2.","We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that collision and liability related auto claims increased just five-tenths of 1% in the quarter. Encouragingly, the CCC data represents the first quarterly year-over-year increase in repairable claims since the third quarter of 2018. The uptick in frequency is related to an increase in miles driven, more severe and frequent weather in certain markets and the ongoing increase in distracted driving. ","Consistent with the year-to-date results, during the third quarter, the growth in recycled products was higher than that for aftermarket, though the aftermarket line showed improving trends as we moved through the quarter. Again, our North America's team's focus on profitable growth drove excellent year-over-year margin improvements. ","Segment gross margins were 44.2% and EBITDA margins were 12.8% reflecting improvements of 100 basis points, and 50 basis points respectively when compared to the third quarter of 2018. These are among the best third quarter margins our North American team has achieved in five years. Furthermore, when removing the self-service business, which experienced the greatest downward impact on margins from the continued steep decline in scrap prices, gross margins and EBITDA margins for the rest of our North American segment were up 120 basis points and 80 basis points respectively. These strong margins are evidence that our focus on profitable revenue is working. ","As just mentioned, scrap metal pricing tumbled during the quarter and placed pressure on Q3 results. As Varun will discuss, this will unfortunately set an even higher hurdle with respect to our fourth quarter results. ","We also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision SKU offerings, and the total number of certified parts available growing 5% and 10.3% respectively year-over-year in the third quarter. As evidenced that we continue to take share, during the quarter, our team successfully negotiated a new three year contract with a top tier customer. Under this new agreement, LKQ will be the primary provider of alternative replacement parts for this customer across the United States with incentives to grow their annual volume with us. ","Additionally, during the quarter the team launched a regional pilot program with a top five insurance carrier to be their preferred supplier for all recycled parts. As part of this program, we are highlighted within CCC's estimating platform to show our parts first in the search function and are specifically designated as the approved supplier for this carrier. While we don't anticipate this pilot program to have a material impact on our results, if eventually rolled out on a national basis, it could provide an uptick to our salvage volumes.","Lastly on North America, during the quarter our glass business PGW and FCA Mopar, mutually agreed to end the agreement related to the distribution of batteries to the FCA dealer network. Similar to rationalizing our asset base, we are continuously looking at our product portfolio to assure we are focusing on profitable revenue. While ending this agreement will negatively impact our organic revenue growth in Q4 and throughout 2020, it will have a nominal impact on earnings in both periods and will improve the future operating margins of our PGW business. ","Moving to our European segment, organic revenue growth for parts and services in the third quarter increased 2.1% on a reported basis, and seven-tenths of 1% on a same day basis. Acquisitions added 1.3% of revenue growth to the European results, while the strong dollar resulted in a negative impact of 4.6%. As noted by other public companies with European exposure, the soft economic backdrop continues to create an industry headwind. ","That said, our performance on a relative basis appears to be strong, which gives us confidence that we are gaining share. While we don't disclose country-by-country detail, on a same day basis, we witnessed positive organic revenue growth for each of the markets in which we operate, except for Germany, which was essentially flat, and Italy, which was down. The Italian market continues to face significant macroeconomic headwinds.","Across the continent, we expect trade disputes with the U.S. along with Brexit related uncertainty to continue to weigh on the European economies. With respect to Brexit, as most of you know, on October 28, European leaders agreed in principle to extend the Brexit deadline until January 31, 2020. We continue to closely monitor the Brexit situation to ensure our UK business is positioned accordingly with appropriate inventory levels. ","As most of you on the call are aware, on September 10, we provided the investment community with an overview of our European strategy. The call focused on our transformation into a sleeker, more agile organization, which internally we refer to as 1 LKQ Europe. ","As I stated on the September call, going forward, we will begin to operate more as a single business as opposed to a collection of independent businesses. Today, we are by a wide margin, the largest most profitable distributor of automotive parts in Europe, with metrics that are unparalleled in the industry with respect to the number of countries and customers served, the number of locations operated, SKUs offered and total revenue generated. Our goal now is to optimize all aspects of 1 LKQ Europe. ","Importantly, during Q3, we experienced a 90 basis points sequential improvement in EBITDA margins compared to only 20 basis points of sequential growth in 2018. The margin improvement is entirely consistent with the expectations we set forth during our call last month. And as Varun will discuss, the improvement is after covering approximately 10 basis points of transformation expenses.","As Europe has become a larger portion of our global revenue and as part of our Board\u2019s ongoing director refreshment process, on October 3, we announced the addition of Patrick Berard to our Board of Directors. As CEO of Rexel Group, Patrick has a successful track record of leading global B2B distribution networks. His operational knowledge and experience of the European markets will provide tremendous value to the Board and the organization as we continue to execute our 1 LKQ Europe strategy, and we welcome his addition to our Board. Alongside Robert Hanser who joined our Board in 2016, Patrick represents the second addition to the Board with extensive experience in the European markets and distribution. ","Now let's move on to our specialty segment. During Q3, organic revenue growth for parts and services for our specialty segment increased 1.5% on a reported basis and was generally flat when adjusting for one more selling day as we continued to face unfavorable market conditions in Canada. On the plus side, the rollout of our RV OEM warranty programs continues to yield positive results and were well received at the RV Open House event in Elkhart, Indiana in September. Additionally, the team finalized a designated supplier agreement to be the aftermarket parts and services provider to Cap-IT Genuine Truck Ware stores. ","Moving on to corporate development. The third quarter was quiet with no acquisitions closing during Q3. On the first day of Q4, we closed on the acquisition of another diagnostics and calibration business in North America. This represents our second transaction in the services sector, and is consistent with our strategy to become a leader in the diagnostics and calibration market. During the third quarter, our development team continued to make solid progress with our assets held for sale efforts, and ongoing rationalization of our asset base and the divestiture of non-core businesses. ","On August 8, we announced the divestiture of our recycled aviation parts business AeroVision International. Additionally, on October 1, we announced that we merged our subsidiary Auto Kelly Bulgaria with Elit Kar creating one of Bulgaria's leading distributors of automotive spare parts. LKQ now owns a 20% equity interest in the combined business. ","Finally, during Q3, we continued our efforts in rationalizing our branch network in Europe by closing six underperforming branches in Western Europe and two in Eastern Europe. ","And with that, I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who\u2019ll run through the details of the segment results and discuss our updated 2019 guidance. ","Varun Laroyia","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, especially related to improvement in segment EBITDA margin, and strong free cash flow generation. These are exciting times for us as the field teams have embraced our key financial priorities of profitable revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation. The results speak for themselves. ","Seeing the positive momentum carrying through the third quarter enhances our confidence about LKQ's strategic priorities and our ability to deliver on them. Before diving into the results, let's start with the key financial highlights. ","Operating cash flows in the third quarter were $327 million, the second highest quarterly amount in the company's history, trailing only the most recent previous quarter, that being the second quarter of 2019. Our segment teams are doing a tremendous job managing trade working capital to deliver strong operating cash flows. After two historically high quarters of cash flow generation, we do expect to see a softer fourth quarter in terms of operating cash flows. I'll cover the full year outlook in the guidance discussion. ","Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $262 million or $126 million higher than the same period in 2018 and $800 million on a September year-to-date basis. While the absolute number of free cash flow is important, we are also actively analyzing the efficiency of our cash flows and what level of our earnings we can convert to cash on a sustainable basis. ","Looking at slide number 25, you can see a positive trend in the free cash flow to EBITDA conversion ratio this year on the programs we put in place in the second half of 2018. This year's growth trajectory is well above our initial expectations. And while that ratio will moderate in the fourth quarter, I am very encouraged about the improvement relative to the last five years. The strong cash flows enabled us to buy back 3.9 million shares of LKQ\u2019s stock for approximately $101 million in the third quarter. ","Looking at slide number 26, for the program to-date we have purchased 13.2 million shares at an average price of $26.66, a healthy discount to recent trading levels. Additionally, we paid down debt by $109 million in the quarter and $391 million in the nine months through September 30. By doing so, we were able to decrease our net leverage ratio to 2.6 times, which is the same level as the first quarter of 2018, the last quarter before we acquired Stahlgruber.","Getting back to the pre-acquisition leverage ratio, following the company's largest ever transaction, within five quarters is a terrific accomplishment. And this of course does not reflect the active share repurchase program I referenced earlier. Returning cash to our shareholders while reducing our net leverage ratio speaks to the strength of our business to generate strong cash flows. Nick mentioned the $500 million expansion to the share repurchase authorization, which is supported by our expectation of sustained strong cash flows, and the success of our share repurchase program to-date. ","Now I will cover our consolidated and segment results, similar to last quarter, to save myself some words and also as the accompanying earnings deck is largely self explanatory, when I refer to net income and diluted EPS, please note that I will be referring to the amounts from continuing operations attributable to LKQ shareholders. In addition, Nick covered the details on net income and earnings per share, so I will not repeat. ","Please turn to slides 12 and 13 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated third quarter results. The consolidated gross margin percentage decreased 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.1%, though please note that the reported margin includes $17 million in restructuring related costs classified in cost of goods sold, which represents a 50 basis point negative impact on gross margin. Setting aside the restructuring, we saw improvement in the quarter driven by 100 basis point improvement in North America. ","Restructuring and acquisition related costs in operating expenses were $9 million as a result of ongoing expenses related primarily to the restructuring initiative we announced last quarter. Interest expense was favorable by $9 million or lower by 21% compared to the third quarter of 2018, owing to low interest rates and average debt balances and some favorable translation effects. ","Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 28.1% for the quarter, which reflects the incremental expense for the year-to-date catch up, caused by a change in our estimate of the annual effective tax rate. We increased the estimated rate to 27.5%, up from 27% this quarter, primarily due to a shift in our projected geographic allocation of income. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which relates mostly to our investment in Mekonomen reflected income of $4 million versus expense of $20 million in the third quarter of 2018. You will recall that we recorded a $23 million impairment charge on our Mekonomen investment last year. ","Now please turn to Slide 16 for highlights on segment performance starting with North America. Gross margin was 44.2% or 100 basis points higher than last year. For the most part, the margin expansion reflects the continued benefits of initiatives in both of our aftermarket and salvage operations, as well as efforts in our glass business to be recognized for our quality of service and breadth and depth of inventory, and also the ability and successfully to renegotiate underperforming contracts. ","While the self-service operation was a drag on segment gross margin, with a quarter-over-quarter decrease due to scrap pricing, the impact was not material on a year-over-year basis. Sequential changes in scrap prices had an unfavorable impact of $8 million for the quarter, compared to a negative impact of $7 million in the third quarter of 2018, creating a $1 million year-over-year negative swing. With scrap trading at even lower levels in October, we are anticipating a further hit in the fourth quarter. ","Operating expenses increased by 50 basis points relative to the prior year to 32% for the third quarter of 2019. We picked up a selling day this year, which had a positive leverage effect, but there were several offsetting factors that pushed expenses higher than a year ago. ","First, incentive compensation contributed to a 50 basis points increase year-over-year. Last year, the segment fell behind in its bonus targets, causing downward revisions of the bonus accrual, whereas this year's strong performance generated upward revisions in the third quarter. ","Second, as mentioned previously, facilities expenses continued to trend higher this year due to expansions and rate increases related to renewals. Facilities expenses increased by 40 basis points relative to a year ago. Our North America team is actively working on monitoring underperforming locations for potential rationalization. ","On the positive side, North America showed positive leverage in other personnel costs through lower insurance claim costs as well as disciplined hiring, and implementation of the cost reduction plan I described last quarter. In total, segment EBITDA for North America in the third quarter was $166 million, up $12 million or 60 basis points higher than the prior year. ","Closing out on North America, I'd like to recognize the team for following through on the pursuit of the profitable revenue growth objectives. A year ago, we disclosed a 70 basis points decrease in segment EBITDA margin in a period with 5.2% organic parts and services revenue growth. This year, North America has recovered almost the full variance in margin with organic parts and services revenue growth of 1.4% on a per day basis. A disciplined approach of focusing on profitable revenue growth has been a significant enabler of the year-over-year margin improvement. ","Moving on to the European segment on Slide 19, gross margin in Europe was 35.3%, down 130 basis points relative to the comparable period of 2018. As Nick previously noted, we recognized restructuring expenses in the United Kingdom for branch and brand rationalization related to the Andrew Page operation. These expenses represented a negative 120 basis point impact for the quarter. Outside of these charges, the segment gross margin was roughly flat, with lower margins in our Central European operations due to pricing and mix mostly offset by benefits of 30 basis points from centralized procurement and improving margins in the United Kingdom. ","With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 30 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago. Personnel expenses represented the largest portion of the increase, primarily related to the tightening of bonus accrual adjustments, wage inflation and the negative leverage effect caused by lower sales growth. ","For the third quarter of 2019, there was a 10 basis point headwind associated with the ongoing transformation efforts related to the 1 LKQ Europe program. The relatively low amount in the quarter reflects that many projects are in the early stages, and all the costs are currently being capitalized, for example, in the ERP program. We expect the operating expense portion of these costs to increase in the fourth quarter and going forward into 2020. ","European segment EBITDA totaled $125 million, a 3.6% decrease over last year. As shown on slide number 21, relative to the third quarter of 2018, both the sterling and the euro weakened by 5% and 4% respectively against the dollar causing a negative effect from translation. The net effect on GAAP EPS this quarter was not material, but represented about a penny headwind on adjusted EPS. Segment EBITDA was 8.6% for the quarter, down 20 basis points compared to the same period last year, with about half of the decrease attributable to transformation costs. ","We remain confident in our ability to deliver the outcomes detailed in our September 10 1 LKQ Europe goal and expect to finish the full year within the previously disclosed segment EBITDA margin range of 7.8% to 8.3%. ","Turning to the specialty segment on Slide 22, the gross margin percentage declined 80 basis points in Q3 relative to the comparable period of 2018. Of this amount, 40 basis points related to unfavorable product mix, while 20 basis points resulted from higher net product costs, as our supplier discounts were lower than realized in the prior year. ","On the other hand, operating expenses improved by 130 basis points with reductions in personnel and freight costs, more than offsetting higher selling expenses. The improvement is partially attributable to the leverage benefit from an additional selling day in the third quarter in 2019. Segment EBITDA for specialty was $45 million, up about 6% from Q3 of 2018 and as a percentage of revenue was up 50 basis points to 11.5%. With a backdrop of low revenue growth, the specialty team has taken decisive action, as evidenced by the year-over-year decrease in operating expense dollars and continues to evaluate the cost structure to protect the segment margin. ","Let's move on to liquidity and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 24, you will note that our operating cash flow for Q3 was $327 million or 70% higher than a year ago. Our key working capital accounts that is trade receivables, inventory and payables generated a cash inflow of $58 million in the quarter compared to an outflow of $64 million a year ago. The purchasing teams continue to take a disciplined approach to inventory, given soft trading conditions, which has contributed to a year-over-year improvement in working capital. ","That said, we anticipate inventory to represent a use of cash in the fourth quarter as we take advantage of buying opportunities and build inventory for the expected seasonal revenue increase going into Q1. Do note that while we are making solid progress on the vendor financing program in Europe, we do not expect meaningful benefits till we get into the new year. ","CapEx for the quarter was $64 million, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of $262 million and $800 million on a year-to-date basis. ","Finally, moving to Slide number 27, as of September 30, we had $433 million of unrestricted cash, resulting in net debt of about $3.5 billion. ","Now, I would like to provide an update on our annual guidance. Please note the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels. As Nick noted earlier, we are pleased with the third quarter results. North America continues to perform well despite the ongoing challenges in scrap metal prices. Our specialty segment is continuing to create new service offerings that have won industry-wide acclaim and has been decisive on costs given the revenue outlook. We see challenges with European economic conditions, holding for the remainder of the year. And despite the underlying business being resilient, the management team is adapting to the softer market conditions by accelerating the integration and cost efficiency programs in addition to simplifying by thoughtfully evaluating various programs that may not deliver benefit in the near-term. ","As you\u2019ll recall, details of the European actions were provided at a comprehensive briefing on September 10. As mentioned earlier, we expect scrap metal prices to continue to negatively impact our results in the fourth quarter. Despite this backdrop, we are holding the adjusted EPS at the midpoint of $2.34, while appreciating some headwind in Q4 from scrap metal prices and FX at the current levels. We are increasing our expected cash flows from operations for the year by $150 million at the low end to $950 million and by $125 million to hit $1 billion at the high end. ","I'll run you through the updated guidance figures. Organic parts and services revenue growth revised to 25 basis points to 100 basis points for the full year to take into account the actual for the most recent quarter. Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis is updated to a range of $1.69 to $1.76 accounting for the first half activity primarily related to the non-cash impairment charges as well as restructuring charges incurred through September; Adjusted diluted EPS in a narrower range of $2.31 to $2.37, and so $2.34 at the midpoint. Cash flows from operations has been increased to a range of $950 million to a $1 billion and capital spending range is narrowed to $240 million to $260 million. ","In summary, the third quarter has several highlights showing where actions are bearing fruit such as North American margins and generating strong free cash flow that's funded the ongoing share repurchase program and the materially higher debt pay down. While the softer macro conditions in Europe and the ongoing downward pressure in scrap gives us full support, we believe there is resiliency in the model to adjust to the market conditions and deliver on our commitments. Overall, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future. ","Now, I'll turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks.","Nick Zarcone","Thank you, Varun for that financial overview. In closing, I would like to review a few of the key initiatives discussed on previous calls that will continue to be points of focus during the balance of 2019 and as we begin our 2020 budgeting process. ","First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive higher levels of cash flow, which in turn, give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. ","And as you can see from our third quarter results, these programs and targets are gaining momentum throughout the organization. And our teams are diligently working towards achieving their respective goals. ","We have well thought out plans, are focused on crisp execution, and we are achieving positive results. I want to thank our over 51,000 team members who daily endeavor to overcome the short-term variables that are out of our control by tackling opportunities to drive organic sales, aggressively pursue market share gains, implement operational efficiencies to enhance the productivity and profitability of our organization, and to provide industry-leading customer service. We believe that when combined, these factors will create long-term value for our stockholders. ","And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison ","Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. And apologies for the background noise. Varun, the cash flow is such an impressive piece of the story right now. And I'm curious, to the extent you're drawing down inventory on a per location basis, if you will, have you seen any impact on fulfillment rates or have you been able to sustain those fulfillment rates?","Varun Laroyia ","Craig, hey, good morning. It's Varun here. I think it's a great question. And as I said in some of the upfront remarks, the teams have just been doing a phenomenal job on the trade working capital program. ","Just for the quick memory jogger, trade working capital comprises inventory tables offset by trade receivables. And as we said, we were in a overbought position in several locations as we have optimized our overall distribution, including the level of inventory that we were holding in several sites. We have certainly seen a reduction. The other piece to note is, as we've always talked about, as revenue becomes a little bit softer -- and again, this is in line with the pursuit of profitable revenue, so the quality of revenue, inventories will also get readjusted. And that really is what's happening. ","To your specific question with regards to are we seeing any stock out scenarios or any drop in fulfillment rates? Absolutely not. This will be done very, very carefully in terms of where we were holding excess inventory, inventory that was not moving for example. And to kind of give you one specific example, you would have noted that we took a COGS restructuring for our Andrew Page operations in the United Kingdom. Again, as part of the branch and brand rationalization, there was inventory that frankly did not fit with the future plans for that business. And that's really how it's taking place. But no, we're seeing no drop off in any fulfillment rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jeffries. Please go ahead.","Bret Jordon","Hey, could you talk about the impact from this Fiat Chrysler battery distribution shift? I mean, I guess what was it? What would be the revenue comparison with it exiting the business? What's the margin benefit? I think those were sort of profitable sales. And then what's the timing on it? Does it impact the fourth quarter or is that 2020 shift? ","Nick Zarcone","Thanks, Brett. We started the FCA agreement in January of 2018. As we ran through last year, clearly the impact on organic growth was about 1% in a positive fashion. So that's basically what we're going to be giving up over the next 12 months. It will start a bit here in Q4. It won't be a full impact, probably 70 to 80 basis points of pressure on organic. And then we'll -- obviously the full revenue give back, if you will, will occur in 2020. But again, the reason for not renewing that contract is it wasn't meeting our internal kind of hurdles as it relates to margins and returns. And I think the folks at FCA appreciated that. So it was a amicable kind of separation, if you will. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, while it will have an impact on our organic growth, the impact on earnings will be nominal. And so margins will be going up by getting rid of that low margin business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin from SunTrust. Please go ahead. ","Stephanie Benjamin","I wanted to touch on what you're seeing in the North America aftermarket business. I think you pointed to salvage really outperforming but you were seeing some acceleration on the aftermarket side as we moved throughout the quarter. Is that more function of just seeing some easier comps or how should we kind of think about the performance of really the strength in the salvage and then what's going on in the aftermarket? Thanks.","Nick Zarcone","Sure. On the salvage side, obviously we have a leading position. We've been able to buy cars, total losses at a reasonable price. And so our margins in that business are strong and we believe they will continue to be strong. On the aftermarket side of the business, again, the growth early in the quarter was a little bit slower. We showed progress during the quarter. The early returns here in October look very good as it relates to aftermarket product. We think some of it, again, has to do with the pitch towards higher APU by the insurance companies and obviously aftermarket products are a largest share of the alternative marketplace. We've seen a little bit of positive movement out of the folks down in Bloomington at State Farm. Nothing to write home about, but again, the movement in the positive direction, if you will. ","And then actually the GM strike has helped us a little bit as well. So there's a number of things that are kind of gentle tailwinds in the aftermarket business, and we're anticipating that they will continue in Q4. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead. ","Michael Hoffman ","Hi, thank you very much for questions. Happy Diwali, Varun.","Varun Laroyia ","Last weekend.","Michael Hoffman ","Yes, it was. Cash flow from operations, is that, one of its best percent of revenues ever. Where can that go and how do I think about that progressing into next year? ","Varun Laroyia ","Great question, Michael and really appreciate the kind wishes for Diwali also. It is a big event in the Hindu calendar. And again for those of you that celebrate Halloween and my family celebrates all of it, Happy Halloween to everyone, we\u2019re certainly enjoying great LKQ weather here in Chicago, needless to say. Yes, and with regards to cash flow generation, this is something that we've talked to the markets for quite some time. This is a case of operating our businesses with a tremendous amount of focus.","Again, as I kind of said in some of my upfront comments, the pace at which our field teams have taken over this initiative has been phenomenal. We are thrilled about it, and it really gives us various options. If you think about it the way we have deployed the capital over the last year, last four quarters, it's been a balanced capital allocation strategy. Not only have we bought back $352 million worth of LKQ stock, in addition to that last 12 months, we've paid down close to $426 million on our debt that we've been carrying also. ","In addition to that, as we think about going into 2020, there will be the seasonal uptick with regards to revenue. And so, we are seeing at this point of time certain buying opportunities in all three of our segments, North America wholesale, Europe and also specialty, and we will judiciously deploy that cash. ","And with regards to the share repurchase program, given the success of that program, as we announced earlier this morning, the Board has re-upped for further $500 million. So at this point of time, we have close to $650 million of capacity. And then again the debt pay down will continue. We don't talk about corp dev transactions in any case, but we have made a commitment that there were no large platform transactions that were in the pipeline and it really will be kind of going back towards our debt pay down, share repurchases and things along those lines. ","I think the one piece that I'm not sure very many people have noticed that at the high end of our operating cash flows in the upgraded guidance, we\u2019re calling out $1 billion of operating cash flows in the current fiscal year. And we think that is tremendous. It doesn't happen overnight. And again, just really a massive thanks to our field teams for really getting back in terms of the focus on this initiative. As we think going forward, various options to move forward in terms of how we deploy the cash. There are plenty of alternatives and I'm happy to report that there are a number of very exciting opportunities of what we can do. We will certainly give further guidance when we give guidance for 2020 in terms of more robustness in terms of how we plan to deploy that capital. But as of now, we do have several levers that we could deploy that cash. ","Nick Zarcone","And Michael, one of the things going forward that has had almost no impact thus far is the vendor financing program, as Varun indicated in his prepared remarks, that will really begin to kick in next fiscal year. And so that will be in an incremental lever that we will have on a going forward basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Daniel Imbro","I wanted to follow up on the revenue rationalization. You guys have done a great job kind of rationalizing unprofitable business in both the U.S. and Europe. You mentioned the FCA contract, but how far along are we in that process? Is there still further business that you think you can rationalize in Europe and then same question for the U.S. as well? ","Nick Zarcone","Yes, so in the U.S., we think we're largely done. Again, we spent a lot of time last year, early this year really focusing on profitable revenue growth and margins, gross margins in our North American business. Clearly, the FCA contract didn't fit within that, those parameters. So again, we decided to exit. In Europe it\u2019s less of a product line review and more of a kind of a country-by-country review. I mean part of the reason for exiting Bulgaria was, it was an incredibly low margin opportunity. We still have some other businesses that are being held for sale in Europe and they are lower margin businesses as well. ","We continue to monitor and will continue to monitor both on a product line basis and kind of a legal entity basis to find opportunities we\u2019re looking forward. It's just -- those activities or businesses just are not going to return on the level of margins and return on capital that we believe our shareholders desire. And we will continue to be aggressive in kind of pruning opportunities, but there's no one big material item out there, Daniel. It's kind of pruning some smaller businesses and\/or lines of business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Chris Bottiglieri","So yes, first off a great job on the free cash flow and North America margins really impressive. I did want to focus on Europe with that said. Relative to the guidance that you gave on 9\/10, just wanted to get a sense where it looks like kind of a steep implied ramp in Q4, did something change at all at the margin when you gave that guidance or was this always meant to be Q4 weighted? And then -- nothing that\u2019s out of the way. And then this is a related thought. I don't speak Dutch, but it seems like you've made some branding efforts in the Netherlands and Belgium with rebranding Fource. I was hoping you can kind of comment on what you're doing there and kind of what that means for the overall portfolio. If you see a broader rebranding taking place? Thank you. ","Nick Zarcone","Yes, so I'll start and Varun can fill in. The results for the third quarter for Europe were exactly in line with our expectations when we set forth the guidance back on September 10th. And yes, we anticipate that Q4 will be a decent quarter for us in Europe. And so there's no change if you will in the kind of the quarterly progression from what we anticipated back on September 10th. ","As it relates to your comment in the Netherlands and Fource, the reality is, while we refer to Sator as the broader organization in the Benelux region, and that's the name of the holding company, our go-to-market brand has always been Fource. And that's been the case for many, many years. I think what you may have seen is, some programs where that -- kind of has bubbled up to the surface. But there's no change there. That's always been our trade name in the Benelux region. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan Merkel ","I want to follow-up on EBITDA for Europe in the fourth quarter if I could. I'm just curious, do you think you can expand margins year-over-year or is the macro still too much to overcome?","Varun Laroyia","Ryan, it\u2019s Varun. Yes, we do believe we can expand it. I\u2019ll give you a couple of data points to think through. First of all from the investor discussion we had seven weeks ago, on the 10th of September with regards to Europe, we were very careful in terms how we were putting forward the cadence of the margin progression, not only for 2019 but the next few years also. Nothing has changed on that front, even including the macroeconomic piece, it has been playing out exactly the way we thought it to be. ","You will probably recall in the second quarter we had called out a restructuring plan. And the restructuring plan essentially was to contemplate across all three of our reporting segments, optimizing the infrastructure costs, given the macroeconomic outlook with regards to revenue, we know that there was a certain level of revenue that we needed, given the relatively high fixed costs nature of the European business. And with regards to that, we have been taking action. And you would have noted in addition to the $17 million of COGS restructuring we took another $9 million was taken in the third quarter. We will see some of those benefits come through also. ","So overall, it was planned along those lines, and we do fundamentally believe that our European business will be within the range of the 7.8 to be 8.3 that we had called out seven weeks ago, so nothing has changed from that perspective. ","Nick Zarcone","And on a year-to-date basis, we're at 7.8 in Europe, so the fourth quarter does not need to be hard if you will to hit the guidance that we set forth on September 10.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We have no one in queue at this time. I'll turn the call over to you. ","Nick Zarcone","Okay. Thank you, operator. Well to everybody on the other ends of the call, we greatly appreciate your time and attention. We understand this is a very busy reporting season and we appreciate you spending this past hour with us. Again, we look forward to chatting with everybody again in late February, as we announce our 2019 year-end results, which I believe is going to be on February 20. And we're looking forward to a good conversation then as well. So thank you and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Boutross. You may begin.","Joseph P. Boutross - Director, Investor Relations","Thanks, Devon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Rob Wagman and Nick Zarcone. Please refer to the LKQ website for earnings release issued this morning, as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.","Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in our form 10-K for 2014 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.","During this call we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release.","And with I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. At LKQ we are a mission driven company, and I would like to start this call by highlighting our recently updated mission statement.","We want to be the leading global value-added distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive available and cost-effective selection of parts solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operating. We are well on our way toward fulfilling our mission statement. Our goal is to be the leading distributor, versus simply a parts provider. We are global, with nearly 28% of our revenue outside of North America. Our products are for all types of vehicles and not solely replacement products for autos and light trucks. And most importantly, we are focused on building strong partnerships with our customers, our people, our suppliers, and the communities in which we operating.","With that said, I believe our performance during the quarter speaks to this mission in I am quite pleased with the results. In Q2, revenue reached a new quarterly height of $1.84 billion, an increase of 7.5% as compared to $1.71 billion in the second quarter of 2014. Net income for the second quarter of 2015 was $119.7 million, an increase of 14.1% as compared to $104.9 million for the same period of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, increased 14.7% from $0.34 for the second quarter of 2014.","Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 7.5% for the quarter, and on a constant currency basis, total growth for parts and services was 14.9%. I am particularly pleased with our EPS performance, given the effect from FX and soft commodity prices, which combined negatively impacted the year-over-year change in EPS by $0.03.","On a six-month year-to-date basis, revenue was $3.61 billion, an increase of 8.3% from $3.33 billion for the comparable period of 2014. Parts and services organic revenue growth for the first six months of 2015 was 7.5%. Net income for the first six months of 2015 was $226.8 million, as compared to $209.5 million for the first half of 2014. Diluted earnings per share was $0.74 for the first six months of 2015, as compared to $0.69 for the comparable period of 2014.","Now on to our operations. During the quarter, our North American operations benefited from various macro trends. Let me highlight few. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation the 12-month moving average for miles driven through May 2015 reached its highest level since 1990, the year they began tracking the data. For 2015, cumulative miles driven witnessed a year-over-year increase of 3.4% through May.","In addition, the year-to-date average price of unleaded regular gas was $2.42 a gallon through May of 2015, compared to an average of $3.51 during the same period in 2014. This represents 31% drop in the average gas price. Also, the unemployment rate in the U.S. has improved. The average unemployment rate in Q2 of 2015 was 5.4%, compared to 6.2% for Q2 of 2014, a 13% decrease year-over-year. And lastly, new car sales continue to improve. The SAAR rate for Q2 2015 was 17.2 million units, compared to 16.6 million units for Q2 of 2014, a 4% increase year-over-year.","Now some specifics on our North American business. In Q2, our North American segment had organic growth of 6.3%. On a constant currency basis, organic revenue growth was 7.2%, with the difference primarily due to the weakness in the Canadian dollar. As noted on slide eight, during the second quarter we purchased nearly 75,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 5.6% increase compared to Q2 of 2014. During Q2, the pricing at auction was flat year-over-year, but we are also buying a new vehicle compared to 2014. This younger vehicle dynamic should equate to higher top-line revenue and improve margin dollars in this line of business.","Also, our North American aftermarket parts business continues to perform well, as witnessed by its positive 30-basis-point contribution year-over-year to our wholesale North American gross margins. Another important metric that we track is the number of available certified parts. On a year-over-year basis, that number of SKUs increased 18%, which is critical to our insurance partners.","Lastly, in our self-service retail businesses, we acquired over 131,000 lower cost self-service and crush-only cars, as compared to 143,000 in Q2 of 2014, or roughly a 8.4% decreased. This decreased was intentional, given the downward trend in scrap prices we faced in Q1, which continued as we entered Q2. We were encouraged as Q2 progressed because we began to witness period of pricing improvement and stability in the scrap market. Though this improvement was a positive from Q1 lows, we were slightly down sequentially, and 36% year-over-year. As we enter Q3, this temporary improvement has softened due to the sluggish demand out of China and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Nick will provide some further context around scrap shortly.","Now moving to our European operations. In Q2, our wholesale European segment had organic revenue growth of 10.1% and acquisition growth of 11.1%, which was offset by a decrease of 11.7% related to foreign exchange rates. ECP's continued solid performance drove organic revenue growth of 11.6% in the quarter, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 7.1%. In addition, during Q2 our collision parts revenue in ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 33%. Our UK-based insurance industry relation teams have been working diligently with our 17 insurance partners in the UK to drive increased alternative collision parts usage within their respective body shop networks.","During the quarter ECP opened two additional branches, bringing our UK network to 194 branches. We anticipate operating five branches in Q3 and three additional in Q4, keeping us on track to open the 13 branches we approved for 2015.","Now turning to our Sator business. During the quarter, Sator witnessed additional gross margin benefit year-over-year, primarily from the shift in its network from three step to a two step distribution model and opening of our Lyon location in France in 2014. I am particularly pleased with Sator's 6.2% organic growth in the quarter. Also during the quarter, Sator acquired six additional distributors of aftermarket automotive products in the Netherlands. These acquisitions add 10 additional branches into the market, bringing Sator's branch network to 82, getting our branch count close to being fully built up.","Now to our Specialty mar \u2013 segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year revenue growth of 30% in the quarter, including the benefit of Stag-Parkway, and organic revenue growth of 6.6%. With this type of growth in operational effectiveness of our Specialty segment, we recently approved a lease for a 250,000-square-foot distribution center in Washington state. This facility will allow us to improve service levels across the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada. We hope to have this facility open by the end of 2015.","And lastly on Specialty, earlier this month SEMA released their annual market data report, and last year the industry increased sales for the fifth year in a row, with 2014 increasing total sales volume 8% from 2013. With our current footprint in this segment and the number of new vehicles sales projected to increase in the coming years, we believe we are well positioned for continuing the growth of this segment.","Turing to corporate development. On July 8, 2015, the company announced the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of PartsChannel, Inc., an aftermarket collision parts to distributor with 14 warehouses servicing over 30 markets across the United States. PartsChannel presents attractive synergies with our existing North American aftermarket collision parts business.","Following the PartsChannel announcement, on July 9, 2015, we announced the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire The Coast Distribution System, Incorporated. Coast is a leading distributor of replacement parts and supplies and accessories for recreational vehicles, primarily to retail parts and supply stores, service and repair establishments, and new and used RV dealers in North America. This tender offer began \u2013 period began July 22, 2015, and will expire at the end of the day on August 18, 2015, unless the offer is extended. Because the tender offer is not complete, we are precluded from answering any Coast-specific questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","Also, on July 14, 2015, the company acquired eight self-service yards from Ecology Auto Parts, an auto recycler based in California. This acquisition of the Ecology self-service yards furthers our commitment to the \u2013 expanding our recycled parts business and overall capacity to service the significant car park and population of California. Lastly, during the quarter we also acquired a wholesale salvage business located in Alabama, and an aftermarket parts distributor in Iowa.","Before I turn the call over to Nick, I would like to update everyone on a couple key projects initiated in second quarter that we anticipate will have a positive long-term impact on the company. These initiatives are highlighted on slides 10 and 11.","Our European operations are growing quickly. When we acquired Euro Car Parts it had 89 branches. We've expanded that number up to 194 locations, and added 26 paint distribution locations as well. At the time of the acquisition, the initial 89 branches were supported by a single national distribution center, or NDC, in Tamworth, England. In order to support the growth, we leased two additional sites in nearby locations. Today, we are supporting that branch network out of these three locations, which is inefficient from a logistics point of view, and even with three locations we are projecting to be out of space in a few years' time.","In order to remedy these issues, earlier this year we broke ground on a new leased national distribution warehouse we are calling Tamworth 2, or T2 for short, adjacent to our primary NDC. T2 will be approximately 750,000 square feet, and will include significant automated warehouse functions. We don't expect T2 to be fully operational until 2018. While we anticipate we will ultimately close two of the existing facilities, during 2016 and 2017 we will incur costs on all four.","This is a large and exciting project with a strong return-on-capital profile that will provide us with a competitive advantage in the UK to further protect the business and provide a platform for continued growth, but it will require investment, both in terms of capital and transition expenses. We will give more details in the coming quarters, but for modeling purposes we are preliminarily suggesting that the project will negatively impact in EPS by $0.02 to $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 to $0.09 in 2017, after which we expect a positive contribution. This adverse impact on EPS is primarily due to operating duplicate facilities locations during relocation and start-up. There will be some costs incurred in 2015, but these have been included in our guidance. If these costs are material in any one quarter, we will expect to disclose them separately.","And second, we recently hired the services of Alix Partners, a global consulting and advisory firm, to assist us in identifying areas in which we might uncover potential operational efficiencies and improvements to maintain our market-leading positions. Simultaneously, we are working closely with Alix to find opportunities to continuously enhance the experience for both our customers and team members. While we do expect this process to yield positive financial benefits, it will take some time before we can fully implement any recommendations coming out of that review. As this project with Alix unfolds, we will keep you apprised of its impact.","And at this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on the financial results of the quarter.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary on the quarter, and over the next few minutes I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our three segments, before quickly touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance.","For those of you who accessed our earnings presentation on the website, you will notice that we've included detail on both the second quarter ended June 30, as well as, for your convenience, the first six months of 2015. My comments will generally follow the flow of the presentation, but to be concise on this call, I will primarily focus on the quarterly results.","The Cliff Notes portion of our financial performance in the second quarter of 2015 would be that we experienced solid revenue growth despite the continued headwinds from the strong dollar and lower commodity prices, and our businesses drove margin increases relative to the second quarter of last year.","Consolidated revenue in the second quarter of 2015 was $1.84 billion, representing a 7.5% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.6% increase in revenue for parts and services, partially offset by a 20.5% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in scrap prices, which I will address in a few minutes. The components of the parts and services revenue increase include approximately 7.5% organic, plus 7.4% from acquisitions, before backing out 4.3% for FX.","As noted on slide 14 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 10 basis points to 39.4% during the quarter. The uptick reflected a 40 basis point improvement from operations, offset by a 30 basis point decline due to revenue mix, as the revenue growth of our European and Specialty businesses, which have lower gross margins structures, outpaced that of our North American operations.","We picked up about 10 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses. Facility costs as a percent of revenues declined, primarily due to the shift in revenue mix towards our European and Specialty segments, which structurally have a lower facility expense. These units tend to utilize regional distribution centers, the cost of which is captured in cost of goods sold as opposed to in the facility expense line.","Our distribution costs as a percent of revenue also declined relative to last year, primarily due to the lower fuel prices. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue, mainly due to an expansion of our sales force and administrative personnel in Europe to support the growth of the business.","Segment EBITDA totaled $233 million for the quarter, reflecting a 10% increase from 2014, and as a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.7%, a 30 basis point increase over the 12.4% recorded in the second quarter of last year. The increase in EBITDA, when combined with the lower levels of depreciation, interest expense, and restructuring costs, on both a absolute and relative basis, allows pre-tax income to increase by 16% during the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year. And pre-tax margins expanded by 80 basis points to 10.1%.","Our tax rate during the second quarter was 34.9% up from 34% last year. The tax rate reflects an effective rate of 35.1%, reduce a bit by few discrete items related to state taxes. As Rob mentioned, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39 compared to $0.34, up about 15%, and adjusted EPS before the restructuring charges and other items was $0.39 versus $0.35 a share, reflecting an 11% improvement.","On a year-to-date basis, total revenue is up 8.3% to $3.6 billion for the first month \u2013 first six months of 2014 [sic] 2015 (20:10). Revenue from parts and services increased 11.3%, comprised of organic growth of 7.5% and the impact of acquisitions which added another 7.8%, before factoring in the negative impacts of currency movements. Gross margin for the first six months was 39.4%, reflecting a 30-basis-point decline from the prior year as the favorable experience in the second quarter could not fully offset the downtick in Q1. For the first six months, segment EBITDA margins were up 10 basis points, reflecting the continued efficiencies achieved in terms of warehousing and distribution.","Fully diluted earnings per share for first six months were $0.74 compared to $0.69, reflecting a 7.2% increase, and on an adjusted basis, again before restructuring, EPS for the first six months was $0.76 compared to $0.70, or 8.6% increase. And as Rob mentioned, we estimate that for the first six months of 2015, the significant drop in scrap prices had a $0.03 negative impact on EPS, while the weak foreign currencies relative to the dollar added another $0.03 negative impact on earnings per share.","As highlighted on slide 16, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift can distort the trend in consolidated margins. Accordingly, we have provided some extra segment-by-segment margin information in the presentation to provide more context as to what's going on the businesses.","And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in North America during the second quarter of 2015 increased to $1.045 billion, or about 2% over 2014. This is the combination of a 6.3% organic growth in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue, again the latter of which is due to the lower scrap prices. About half of the organic growth in parts and services was due to value, and half was due to price.","You will recall that the organic growth rate of our North American parts and services business during the first quarter of 2015 was just under 5% due to the tough comparable results posted in Q1 of 2014. During the earnings call back in April, we mentioned that this growth rate would bounce back to normal levels, which it did. This was a solid quarter for our North American business. Gross margins in North America during the second quarter increased 40 basis points relative to last year, from 42% to 42.4%. This increase was primarily due to a solid 50-basis-point increase in our wholesale operations, offset by a decline at our self-service operations.","On a sequential basis, the gross margin was lower than Q1, which as shown by the graph in the upper right hand corner of slide 17 is consistent with our normal seasonal trend. With respect to operating expenses, we lost 50 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2014. On the upside, our wholesale operations tightly controlled the head count which helped reduce facility and warehousing expense as a percent of revenue. In addition, we experienced continued improvements in fuel cost relative to last year, as diesel averages $2.85 a gallon in 2015 compared to $3.94 a gallon last year. This was the primary driver behind a significant improvement in distribution expenses in North America on a percent of revenue basis.","However, these positive trends were largely offset by our self-serve unit, which experienced flat operating expenses but lower revenue to both the significant decline in scrap prices and the reduction in the number of cars purchase and processed. Slide 19 takes a closer look at scrap prices over the last 18 months. You will note that the average price we realized in the second quarter of 2015 was approximately $140 a ton, or down 36% compared to the average of $217 a ton realized in Q2 of last year. In total, the lower pricing reduced our revenue for the quarter significantly, and on a year-over-year basis had approximately a $0.012 negative impact on our EPS during the quarter.","So in total, EBITDA for the North American business during the second quarter of 2015 was $139 million, reflecting a 1.2% increase over the last year. EBITDA for the wholesale operations increased 11% over the prior year, while the self-serve operation saw a decline. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 13.3%, down 10 basis points over the comparable period of last year. Again, the wholesale operations experienced a solid 80-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margins, but that was more than offset by a decline at our self-service operations, again with the later largely reflecting the impact of the lower scrap prices.","Moving on to our European segment, total revenue in the quarter accelerated to $510 million from $465 million. Organic growth in Europe during the quarter was 10.1%, reflecting a combination of 11.6% organic growth at ECP and 6.2% growth at Sator. And the impact of acquisitions in Europe represented an additional 11.1% increase in revenue. These gains were offset by an 11.7% decline due to the translation impact of a strong dollar, creating a negative impact on revenue and resulting in total reported growth for our European parts and services business of 9.5%. Gross margins in Europe increased to 37.9% during the quarter, a 70 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year, and a sequential improvement of 90 basis points over Q1 of 2015.","While a bit of the Q2 pick up is seasonal, we benefited from improved procurement in the UK and the internalization of the gross margin from our 2014 acquisitions in the Netherlands. These are the highest quarterly gross margins we have achieved in Europe since early 2013. With respect to operating expenses in Europe, there were some gives and takes which netted out to a wash. On the upside, we benefited from the internalization of certain delivery activities that were previously outsourced at ECP, as well as lower fuel costs. On the downside, as mentioned we had higher SG&A expenses at both ECP and Sator.","European EBITDA totaled $54 million, a 17.5% increase, even after taking into account the impact of the strong dollar. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the second quarter of 2015 was 10.6% versus 9.9% last year. Again, these EBITDA margins for the European segment are the best we've posted in over 18 months.","We do anticipate the normal seasonal patterns will continue in 2015 and these margins will decline in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. As noted on slide 22, relative to the second quarter of 2014 the pound decline 9% and the euro decline 19%. We estimate that the strong dollar reduced revenue significantly in EPS by about $0.018 during the quarter. As noted on this page, removing the impact of the currency swings would have resulted in second quarter European revenue growth of 21%, and given the margin improvement, EBITDA growth of 32%, which we believe is quite strong.","Turning to the Specialty segment, revenue for the second quarter totaled $284 million, a 30% increase over the comparable quarter of 2014. Obviously the impact of the Stag acquisition in Q4 of last year accounted for the largest component of growth, but the organic growth of 6.6% was also quite strong. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the second quarter remained generally constant with last year at 30.8% compared to 30.9%. The slight 10-basis-point decline is due to mix shift caused by the addition of the Stag business, which has lower gross margin than the core KAO operation. That said, operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down 120 basis points as we continued to see the leverage from integrating the Stag acquisition into the Keystone infrastructure, as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices.","EBITDA for this segment was $40 million, reflecting a 42% increase over last year, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased to 14.1% in 2015 compared to 13% last year. We are quite pleased with the 110 basis points expansion in EBITDA margins compared to the prior year. This is a highly seasonal business and the second quarter is by far the strongest, as demonstrated by the graph in the upper right corner of slide 23. So it is important to recognize that as we move through the back half of the year, you should expect the margins to moderate meaningfully as the selling activity moves lower.","Let's move on to capital allocation, which given the working capital swings, lumpiness of capital spending and the timing of acquisitions, I think is best viewed on a year-to-date basis as presented on slide 25. You will note that our after-tax cash flow from earnings for the first six months was approximately $299 million, and we experienced a $16 million increase in working capital, resulting in approximately $283 million of cash provided by operations.","The working capital uptick is the result of an increase in accounts receivable associated with our revenue growth, partially offset by a reduction in inventory as we continue to work our way down from the intentionally high balances held at year end to protect us from what we anticipated could be some potential port issues early in the year.","Thus far in 2015, we have deployed $109 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $67 million to fund capital expenditures and $42 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. So for the first six months we generated $174 million of free cash and we used about $150 million of that repay our debt balances. We sourced an incremental $5 million from other financing sources. The remaining $29 million was added to our liquidity, and we closed the quarter with the approximately $143 million of cash, of which $85 million is held in Europe.","At June 30, we had $1.7 billion of total debt outstanding, which on a GAAP basis was approximately 2.1 times our latest 12 month EBITDA, and if you factor in the full impact of the EBITDA for the acquisitions completed over the past 12 months, and back out our cash balances, the net debt to EBITDA ratio would be approximately 1.9 times. The weighted average interest rates on our borrowings during the quarter remained constant at 3.4%, and the available capacity on our credit facility was approximately $1.2 billion, which we believe provides adequate liquidity to fund the continued growth of our business.","We are focused on return metrics for our company, and for the latest 12 months both our return on equity and return on invested capital are generally consistent with the levels achieved over the past five years. You should note that we've deployed a significant amount of capital over the past few years, and investment tend to have a lower return in those early years, which clearly has an impact on the metrics. We are, however, focused on driving these higher.","As noted in our press release, we have adjusted our guidance on some of the key financial metrics for the year. As it relates to organic growth for parts and services, we have tightened the full-year range from what was 6.5% to 9%, to now 7% to 8.5%. In terms of earnings per share, we are narrowing the guidance a bit to $1.38 on the low end to $1.45 on the high end, and essentially leaving the midpoint alone. This all assumes that the pound sterling, euro, and Canadian dollar remain at current levels of $1.55, $1.10 and $0.76 respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at approximately $140 a ton.","We recognize that the earnings reported today exceeded the consensus estimates for the quarter, but we would encourage folks to neither add that difference to the current annual consensus, nor extrapolate that forward to the back half of the year. In particular, it is important to be sensitive to the seasonal trends of our businesses and the historical impact that has had on the revenue and operating margins. The consensus EPS estimate for the fourth quarter is currently $0.35, which appears overly optimistic in light of the normal seasonal patterns of our business. Finally, we've adjusted guidance for the income from operations up to $450 million to reflect the slightly lower investment in working capital, and we believe the guidance for capital spending is still valid at $150 million to $180 million.","And at this point, I will turn the call back over the Rob.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nick. Before we open it up for Q&A I wanted to end with a historical summary of our founding strategy and business model highlighted on slide 29, which today is still the nucleus of our company, and one that is cornerstone of our operating segments despite their unique mix of products and geographies. At founding, we saw the opportunity to create a national network of wholesale recyclers to service the North American body shop and auto repair industries. With this strategy, we look to acquire the best recycling locations with the best management teams and operators, and create a network that provided synergies through consolidating this fragmented industry.","These yards, when combined in a given trading zone, would create the highest fulfillment rates in the industry, which today still holds true. This strategy continued when we entered the aftermarket collision business with the acquisition of Keystone to grow our North American alternative collision business, the European market with ECP and Sator, and the specialty space with KAO and tuck-ins like Stag-Parkway.","While our European and Specialty businesses offer different products, and the vernacular can create confusion, make no mistake: The founding strategy and business model is consistent. Each of our businesses operate in fragmented markets that are ripe for consolidation. By buying the number one or number two players in the market, with the right management teams, we can begin to build a network that offers tremendous synergies and scale by offering industry-leading fill rates.","Simply stated, in the vehicle parts business the distributor that has the part readily available, and can get it to the customer on time, wins the sale. We believe that we can offer that capability across all of our segments, and with more runway to grow. With this core strategy and operation model, I am confident that our team of over 30,000 employees will continue to add long-term value for our customers and stockholders.","Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. Our first question comes from Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Also thanks for slide presentation and guidance commentary. All of that has been very helpful today. Nick, first question on guidance, I just want to be clear, does it include either PartsChannel or Coast?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, they do. We're not anticipating that either of those are going to have material impact, Craig, on the back half for the year. It's going to take some time to get them fully integrated and the like. And obviously with Coast, we have to wait to see the results of the tender offer.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And then with respect to the Tamworth DC, on slide 10 it looks like it'll cost $0.09 to $0.12 over the balance of two years. Could you frame the actual cost of the project and how much of that would be capitalized versus expensed?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well \u2013 Craig, this is Nick. Ultimately we're going to lease the facility, but all of the kind of the inner workings, if you will, are going to be capitalized and then depreciated over time. It's a fairly large investment on our behalf, it's on the order of \u00a375 million, so it's quite significant. We have to start paying rent when we take possession of the facility, which will be in early 2016. But it's going to take us some time to fit it out and get it up and running, the better part of a couple years, and so that's why Rob mentioned that we're going to have kind of duplicate rental expense for \u2013 because we're going to have four facilities for period of time, before getting down to two.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then on a related note, I know you've taken greater care to understand future expectations in terms of what's embedded in consensus expectations. I guess I'm wondering, looking ahead to 2016 and 2017, although you haven't provided guidance, is it possible that none of us have really anticipated these costs, given that this is the first time you've really talked about them?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That would be my expectation, Craig, because we did want to get this out to the investment community as soon as we had a pretty good sense as to what was going to mean. We understand that a number of folks do longer-term projections, and there was no way for them to have an understanding as to what may be coming their way related to these projects.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful. Thanks, and we'll get back in the queue.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Nate.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","So, couple things. One, it was nice to see the uptick in the gross margins across the board, and I know that fuel obviously helped on the distribution expense. But minus the normal seasonality and any impact from future acquisitions that might come in a little bit negatively, and I know that we have a little bit of mix shift, but apple to apples, are you guys fairly comfortable that we can kind of continue on a more stable run rate on the gross margin line?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nate this is Nick. I think you have to take a look at that on a business unit by business unit basis, and that's why we provided the additional disclosure with respect to gross margins. You will see there is some quarterly fluctuations in the overall margin structures of the business. We provided the, basically the gross margins over the last six quarters, so we can kind of take that into account as well.","The back half of the year in North America, the margins tend to be generally consistent with the second quarter but obviously down from the first quarter; European margins as well. There's a little bit of fluctuation, and then \u2013 so we would encourage you to take a look at the historical seasonal patterns, because that's the best guidance as to where we may head in the future.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then regarding the Alix project, obviously I think that that probably makes sense with where you are in your kind of build-out of the North American business. Is that kind of signal that there might be an opportunity overall to maybe enhance the operating margins a little bit, in terms of just some network efficiency? Is that one of the overall goals of that project, or is there something else embedded in that?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, that's exactly it, Nate. We've been a very decentralized company, and what we challenged ourselves to do was to figure out how that maintain that entrepreneurial spirit, yet get some operational efficiencies. So with that in mind, we focused on four key components that we are looking at. One is our sales organization; second is logistics, the fleet, because we have thousands of trucks on the road every day; purchasing, getting some more purchasing synergies; and then looking at our dismantling capabilities and how to get some best practices across our region.","So yeah, we do expect some operating efficiencies to come, likely in 2016, mid-2016 we'll start seeing those results come through. But you're spot on, we wanted to make sure we had that entrepreneurial spirit still in the company; that's what the base of this company has been so successful on. So we're going to get the best of both worlds though this project. Assuming it goes the way we expect it to, we will look at Europe at some point, of doing the same process over there.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then final question, in terms of the ECP facility \u2013 and I get the fact that maybe we didn't anticipate the costs, upfront costs for that. But I assume that that's an indication, though, in terms of the bigger picture, where the opportunity is, not only in terms of new parts injection but in terms of just being a little bit more efficient with your distribution capability. In combining those facilities, I assume that the collision network's going to be a little bit more integrated with the mechanical side. So I mean, ultimately, that should get you a lot of synergies out of that, and probably a sign of positive things to come in terms of the potential volume growth that we could get out of that. Is that a fair assessment?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's right on. We're operating out of three buildings now; we are going to go to two eventually. The three buildings, by the way, are roughly 20 miles apart from each other as well. These are literally separated by a retention pond, these two buildings in Tamworth. So we will get some operating efficiencies for sure. And the automation that's coming with it as well will provide some nice pick up there as well, so...","And finally, the other major aspects of doing it is to prepare for future growth. As I said in my remarks, Nate, that we have three buildings and we're already pushing the limits of those, so getting two in the same footprint will be greatly enhancing our capabilities to our customers.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then one last quick check-the-backs question and then I'll turn it over, but any update on State Farm?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Same. We still want to be meeting with them constantly, no decisions have been made, but as far as chrome and bumpers go I can give you an update on that. Quarter, up 16.9%, so they clearly are driving that product type for us. And fingers crossed that they came back here soon.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, and good morning.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jamie.","Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Congratulations by the way on a nice quarter. And let me just add on, the slides, thanks to Joe and Nick and team for all your hard work there. They are tremendously helpful.","If I may, looking at your guidance, it looks like your \u2013 you've tightened your net income guidance but haven't really move the midpoint there, and yet your net cash from Ops guidance is up by $25 million. So I wanted to get into a little bit more detail as to what's driving that? And then maybe to sort of fast forward to a free cash flow question, how many more years do you expect to have this elevated level of CapEx to support things like the DC in the UK, the DC in Washington state and so forth? And are there any other big opportunities to invest in your future growth, sort of globally? Thanks.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll start with the guidance. Again, we tightened up the range a little bit, essentially left the midpoint alone. The uptick on the free cash flow is basically a sense that our working capital needs are going to be less than we originally anticipated. And so we pulled in the net income range, $5 million off the top and up from the bottom. But it's really the working capital that's driving the $25 million uptick in free cash flow.","All of our \u2013 most of our capital spending is to support the growth of our business, Our rough estimate is about 75% of what we spend is growth-orientated, as opposed to repair and replacement and the like. As long as there are really good opportunities to continue to grow our business, we will deploy capital behind our businesses. Obviously something like Tamworth, that maybe a once-in-a-moon kind of event for our companies, something that size and scale. But there are other situations across North America where we are going to be expanding warehouses, going into new distribution facilities to support the continued growth of our business.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I just want to add one thing to that, Jamie. As a percent of revenue, our capital has been pretty much in line. So to Nick's point, as long as there's opportunities to continue to grow the business, it will stay in line with that percentage of revenue.","Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Understood. And just if I may, a quick follow-up, just a housekeeping item. Rob, you've talked about alternative parts usage historically in the U.S. and UK. Are there any update you can provide based on the data you're seeing in those markets? It's still around 9%, I assume, in the UK, and 37%-ish in the U.S., but I wanted to get your insights there?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is correct. A little bit less in the U.S., circa 36% to 37%, it's been right in the middle there, teetering between the two. But we expected that in the U.S. with the recent surge in the new car park. We're seeing the same thing actually over the UK a little bit, with a strong SAAR rate right now, but we do expect as these new cars get into the sweet spot outside of three years, we are going to start seeing an uptick in the AP usage here in the U.S..","Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good. Thanks again, and good luck in the third quarter.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, just one last thing, as we highlight in the slide deck, in our investor deck, is the part count. I just wanted to give a quick update on that. There are actually up to 9.1 parts per estimate now, versus 7.9 just five years ago. So we are seeing more parts get on the estimate, and that's why we're kind of bullish, what we think is going to happen as these cars get into our sweet spot at three years we are going to see that growth in the AP usage.","Jamie J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your company \u2013 your question.","Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ben.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Just quickly on the UK collision side, you've talked in the past about the pilot program with insurance carriers. Any update there, what kind of progress you're making and what that pipeline looks like?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we're still at 17 carriers right now, Ben, in the program, which amounted to about 80% of the UK insurance base. So it's probably going to be at that number for a while. No one has pulled out of the program, and as I mentioned in my remarks, a 33% increase. So still getting traction and still heading in the right direction.","As we've mentioned on previous calls, once we get our 322 built out, our three step to two step in the Netherlands, we will be introducing collision parts there with \u2013 many of the same carriers that write in the UK also write on the continent. So we are probably couple quarters away from launching some kind of program on the continent.","Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, very good. Secondly, looking at the Unipart branches, how have those progressed since you've made those acquisitions? Are they comping in line with the chain? What does profitability at those look like? What your thoughts on the progress there?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll talk about the \u2013 what we've been able to integrate. We've pretty much opened every one of those stores that we did, that we targeted. Remember, some \u2013 we closed two stores to make one, we either closed the ECP store or we closed the Unipart store brought in. That has been done. And we are starting to see the benefits of that. The employees are fully trained now our systems and taking phone calls, as we do in our normal course of business.","As far as the profitability, it does kind of get melded in there into the overall mix, and \u2013 but we're very pleased with what we've done there, and as I said, we have 194 branches now, so we are certainly at the tail end of our build-out of 200 to 225, and we anticipate that being done in the next couple of years.","Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. Lastly from me, we saw some pretty severe flooding in Texas. I'd be interested to hear if those cars are showing up at auction yet, what they look like? I would think with your predisposition toward buying higher quality vehicles, those would be a good fit for you, but just any commentary or color there would be helpful?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll go back to my days at the auction business. Those are great cars, as \u2013 in terms of their quality. Freshwater floods are really great because there's no body damage. We have not seen them start to flow through the auction yet. There is generally a lag of about 45 to 60 days before the pools can get access to the titles, but we do expect some really good salvage to be coming through.","Ben S. Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks guys. Best of luck.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please proceeds with your questions.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. I'll also add my appreciation for these slides. I think there are very helpful. Are there any construction costs for the Tamworth DC built into the second half of 2015 in your guidance?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There are some just ancillary costs related to the project, Bill, but nothing of significance. Again, right now it's under construction as you can see by the slide that we put into the deck. It's a pretty massive facility, but ultimately the landlord is incurring those expenses. Obviously there's some broader project-related activities as we continued to plan out for the outfitting of the facility and the like, but nothing material.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. In terms of the auction environment, can you talk about your average price that you paid per car for the quarter versus a year ago, and what you're seeing in the auctions overall in terms of supply and pricing trends?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure, Bill. This is Rob. Our salvage cost was basically flat. It was about $4 better a vehicle, but again we are buying a younger vehicle, so we know we're buying a better vehicle. On the self-service side of the business \u2013 really not so much in the auction, but we do buy some \u2013 we were down $81 to an average of \u2013 well, just under $400, which is all scrap-related. In terms of the volume at the auctions, very consistent. We track the number of cars at the auctions we visit; they're pretty much flat to slightly up. So plenty of availability. We're still only buying roughly 6% to 7% of the auction, so plenty of availability to keep driving the top line.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then in terms of vehicle miles driven, we know in the U.S. that we've had a pretty strong increase this year. Do you have any data for that in the UK or the Netherlands, by any chance?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We do not have that available. We know the SAAR rate is up, but we do not have miles driven on a European basis. But we'll have Joe get back to you on that.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please proceed with your question.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Yes. Just a question on ECP's organic growth rate for the branches open more than 12 months. It came down a little bit in the quarter versus historical trends, and I was wondering if there were any one-time factors there? Or is that the rate we should expect going forward, just given the maturity of the branches?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, couple factors going on there, Jason. Certainly when we bought the business in 2011 with 89 locations, the 90th, the 91st to the 100th branch were obviously the lowest-hanging fruit. So we're getting at the tail end of that, so that's having a little bit of impact there. There is a surge of new cars as I just mentioned, so that's going to be a little bit of a headwind for the time being, until those cars get out of warranty. One thing that I do want to add, and we show that 12 month and over, that it does include our paint locations now. So that does drag it down a little bit.","And then just one last point on that. In talking to our suppliers, they say that the market is generally a little soft right now. They equate it to the new car sales going up a little bit, and just general market conditions. They do expect it to rebound, so I think you'll still see mid- to high-single-digit growth out of the stores open more than 12 months. You take the paint out of there, it's actually little bit higher. But we are expecting, with the new stores as well as the stores in general, still double-digit growth here for the balance of the year.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","That's helpful. And then, how should be thinking about foreign currency and scrap for the second half for the year?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. If you take a look at the slide where we've kind of set out the historical scrap prices, right, in Q1 the comparison was $224 versus $141; in Q2, $217 in last year, $140 this year; Q3 of last year was $215; so scrap remained pretty steady last year. And if you assume that it's going to stay in the $140 range, we would expect \u2013 we lost a couple pennies in the first quarter, a penny in the second quarter, there is chance that there is a half a penny to a penny yet in Q3. By Q4, where the comparison gets a little bit better \u2013 Q4 of last year was $187, so if scrap stays at $140, it'd be probably more of a rounding error, if you will. So maybe another half a penny to a penny.","On the FX, you can go through the same analysis. Really for the first three quarters of last year, the currencies stayed pretty consistent. On the euro, $1.37, $1.37, $1.33 for the first three quarters of last year. The pound sterling, $1.66, $1.68, $1.67. And so, it was \u2013 we talked about $0.02 in FX last quarter, it was actually $0.016 and rounded up. This quarter was another couple pennies, but again it's a rounding up, so $0.03 for the first six months. We're probably going to be in that same range for Q3, so think about maybe a penny and a half, plus or minus. In Q4, both the sterling and the euro started to drop a little bit, so probably a little bit less in Q4. We thought originally FX would hit us for $0.04 to $0.05. Last call, you may remember we talked about that the $0.08 to $0.10 from scrap and FX was probably going to get flipped, probably $0.06 or so from FX, and that's not a bad estimate.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Hi, guys. I think I have \u2013 the last question here just asked the same question I was going to ask. We're still looking at those same ranges for FX and scrap to impact your EPS guidance for this year, correct? I think it was like $0.03 to $0.04 for scrap and $0.05 to $0.06 for FX?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct. Again, scrap ended the quarter right around $137, $138. There's a lot of noise coming out of China about economic growth and the like, and there are some folks out there forecasting that, that scrap will get little bit softer here. We're assuming, at this point at time, a kind of a steady state on scrap. We'll have to see what the Fed does with interest rates and the impact that has to do on the dollar, but again, we're assuming that rates are going to stay relatively constant at $1.55 for the pound and about $1.10 for the euro.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Is scrap all really predicated on what goes on in China? Because I know Turkey is a big buyer of scrap, too. Are you hearing anything out of there?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Those are the two countries, Gary, you are right. I have not heard much out of Turkey, it's really China is the big one. The domestic mills seem to be doing okay. But Turkey and China will definitely drive the exporting, for sure.","Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Jordan (59:42) with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, good morning guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Brett (59:47).","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","In the Benelux, what percentage of your revenues are two step versus three now? Maybe you can give us some color what the spread on the margin is in those channels?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll have to get back to you on that, Brett (60:03).","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And part of it is, it's hard because once we make the acquisitions, it all gets integrated, if you will, into the \u2013 into our financial system. So it's not like we have a bunch of standalone P&Ls that we then roll up at the end of the month and the end of the quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks. And then I guess on PartsChannel, can you give us any color on what their productivity looked like versus your own aftermarket parts business?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry, their productivity?","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Were they generally generating similar profits to you, or were they less productive because they had smaller scale?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we'll be able to pull their margin up to ours, Brett (60:45), and they did get us into a few new markets, interestingly enough. So yeah, their margins were generally a little bit lower than ours, and they will come up to our numbers.","Unknown Speaker","All right, great, thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Mr. Joe Boutross, LKQ Corporation's Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Joseph P. Boutross - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.","Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's slide presentation.","And, with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Zarcone.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour as we adjusted the timing of our call. We are pleased to share both the results of our most recent quarter and the progress made on the various initiatives we've implemented since our first quarter call. I will provide some high-level comments and then Varun will dig in a bit further into the segments and related financial details before I come back to discuss our updated 2018 guidance and make a few closing remarks.","Overall, we had an excellent second quarter, highlighted by exceptional revenue growth in each of our segments, progress on improving margins and a successful closing of the STAHLGRUBER acquisition. As noted on slide 4, consolidated revenue was a record $3.031 billion, reflecting a 23% increase over the $2.458 billion recorded in the second quarter of last year. This is the first time the company has crossed the $3 billion threshold in a quarter.","Total revenue growth from parts and services was 22.8% during the second quarter, while organic revenue growth in parts and services on a global basis came in at a robust 7.2%. As mentioned over the past several quarters, very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth anywhere close to our level.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the second quarter of 2018 was $0.50 as compared to $0.49 for the same period of 2017, an increase of 2%. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the second quarter of 2018 was $0.61 a share, an increase of 15% as compared to the $0.53 for the same period of 2017. These EPS results were slightly above our expectations and due largely to the strong revenue growth and progress on the profit enhancement plans discussed last quarter.","Let's turn to the operating highlights. As you'll note from slide 6, total parts and services revenue for our North American segment grew 8.3% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment during the quarter was 7.4%, which was ahead of our expectations. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that, according to CCC Information Services, collision and liability related auto claims on a national basis were essentially flat in the second quarter of 2018 compared to last year and down sequentially from the 0.8% growth recorded in the first quarter.","As was the case in Q1, there continue to be meaningful variances in growth rates across the geographic regions of North America. We believe that significant outperformance in our growth relative to the CCC data for repairable claims is due to the continued increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot, that being model years 3 to 10 years old as well as a continued market share gain.","Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q2 was achieved, while miles driven in the United States were up only 0.8% on a nationwide basis in May, although like the claims data there were significant regional differences. The organic growth for aftermarket parts continued to outpace that of salvage parts, as the repair shops continued to focus on improving cycle times given the increased volume of work they were processing.","Importantly, we continue to see increases in the total aftermarket collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 5.7% and 12.6%, respectively in the second quarter. Our North American team made solid progress with their recovery efforts related to many areas, including reducing unwarranted discounts, driving higher levels of stops and orders per vehicle per day with Roadnet, and reducing fleet maintenance cost per mile.","These are just a sample of the several initiatives in play. We know there is more opportunity to be garnered and we are not done. Importantly, we have the right team in place to execute on our plan and capture these opportunities. Lastly, on North America and as many of you know, during Q1 and Q2 of 2018, three U.S. Code trade statutes were cited by the President of the United States as requiring investigation due to national security concerns and intellectual property rights violations. Today, under the enacted round 1 of Section 301, there has been little impact on LKQ from the tariffs or the subsequent Canadian countermeasures given that most of the U.S. origin product shipped to Canada are indirect or stocking transfers.","With that said, if the imposition of tariffs gains further traction and leads to price inflation in our North American segment, we, like many other domestic distributors exposed to tariffs, expect to pass along these increases to our customers. That said, it'll be important to keep in mind that we will not be able to earn a profit on any increases related to cover the tariffs. So, should tariffs become a real consideration, it will appear as though gross profit and EBITDA as a percent of revenue will be a bit lower.","Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 44.2%. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was a very strong 8.3%, reflecting a significant snap-back from Q1 levels, and performance well ahead of our expectations. Acquisitions added an additional 28.8% to revenue growth in Europe during the second quarter of 2018, due largely to STAHLGRUBER being included in the June 2018 results, while the strengthening of the euro and sterling when compared to the second quarter of last year resulted in an FX-related revenue increase of 7.1%.","All of the major operating units in Europe achieved organic growth in excess of 7% with the strong results reflecting both the reversal of the negative impact of the timing of Easter experienced in Q1, and the absence of major weather disruptions. In addition, you will recall that the UK had soft revenue growth in Q1 due in part to some of the branch replenishment issues related to bringing the T2 distribution facility online.","During the last call, we mentioned that the software issues related to the automated elements of this large distribution center appeared to have been largely rectified in early April and sales were trending back to normal levels. Based on the excellent Q2 revenue growth at ECP, you can see that that was indeed the case.","As you know, there were two redundant distribution facilities that were slated to close as part of the overall T2 project plan. As previously disclosed, one closed at year-end and, as expected, the other was vacated and handed back to the landlord in the second quarter. So, those costs are now fully behind us.","With respect to Andrew Page, we continue to integrate and rationalize the Andrew Page branches that we were allowed to retain. And I am happy to report that the entire Andrew Page branch network is now completely being replenished out of the T2 distribution facility.","Additionally, Andrew Page's national distribution center was vacated and returned to the landlord a few weeks ago, with the head office functions still to be consolidated by year-end. At this time, we are in the process of selling 11 Andrew Page branches, including the 9 required by the UK competition authorities and two additional branches that are focused on the commercial vehicle markets. We anticipate the divestiture will close shortly.","During the second quarter, we opened up a total of 17 new branches in Europe, including two new locations in Western Europe and 15 new locations in Eastern Europe. Overall, it was a terrific quarter for our European operations from a revenue perspective, and we made meaningful positive progress on the margin front, which Varun will discuss in more detail.","Let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the second quarter, Specialty reported total revenue growth of 13.6%, including organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.1% and then the Warn acquisition added an additional 9 points of growth.","As you may recall, Specialty was negatively impacted by the harsh March storms both on the demand side for our RV-focused products and our ability to distribute and serve certain markets. Given this dynamic, we believe that during the second quarter, there was a bit of pent-up demand that we were able to capture, further validating the sustainability and resiliency of our business model.","Also, the industry leading product design and development efforts at Warn continues under LKQ's ownership. Warn recently introduced the next generation of powersport winches called AXON and VRX, products that have received tremendous positive feedback from both our customers and industry press.","Moving on to corporate development matters; on May 31 of 2018, the company announced the closing of its acquisition of STAHLGRUBER. This transaction demonstrates our ongoing strategy to expand our European footprint. We believe that STAHLGRUBER's leading market position in Germany, unparalleled distribution network, unique value proposition and strong leadership team will play a pivotal role in our efforts to grow LKQ's business in Europe.","As many of you know, prior to the closing of the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, the European Antitrust Commission cleared the transaction with the exception of the wholesale business of STAHLGRUBER in the Czech Republic, which was referred for review to the Czech Republic competition authority. Accordingly, the operations in the Czech Republic, which represented an immaterial portion of STAHLGRUBER's revenue and profitability, have been temporarily retained by the seller. That said, we have filed our application with the Czech Republic antitrust authorities and have responded in early July to their comments. We remain optimistic about receiving clearance to acquire the Czech-based business of STAHLGRUBER and we'll report on our progress during our Q3 call.","In addition to our acquisition of STAHLGRUBER, we completed four small acquisitions of wholesale businesses in Europe, including one in the UK and three in Sweden for a total net consideration of approximately $7 million during the quarter.","And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun who will run through the details of the segment results.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through our consolidated segment results for the quarter and cover our current liquidity before turning it back to Nick for an update on full year guidance.","Overall, we are pleased with our results for the quarter. After a disappointing start to the year, we feel we're headed back in the right direction. While there is still a ways to go to get our margins back to the desired levels, the initiatives we've put in place are showing promise with some benefits reflected in the second quarter and others primed for the rest of the year.","As Nick mentioned, we closed the STAHLGRUBER transaction in late May. So, we have one month of operating results in our Q2 figures. I'll highlight the impact of STAHLGRUBER in the quarter as relevant later in my remarks. As noted on slide 13 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was down 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.3%. Roughly 70 basis points of the decrease is attributable to our Europe segment with the balance relating to our North America segment. Segment EBITDA totaled $342 million for the first quarter, reflecting a $36 million or a 12% increase over the comparable quarter of 2017.","As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was down 110 basis points to 11.3%. We saw a 30 basis points increase in our operating expenses, largely due to freight and vehicle expenses in our North America segment. And during the second quarter of 2018, we experienced a $13 million increase in restructuring and acquisition-related costs compared to the prior year and a $10 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, both largely due to the STAHLGRUBER acquisition that we closed on May 30.","With that, operating income for the second quarter of 2018 increased by about $12 million or roughly 5% when compared to the same period of 2017. Non-operating items were unfavorable by about $6 million versus Q2 of 2017. The change in gains on bargain purchase and an impairment loss on Andrew Page related to the branches to be divested represent $5 million of the unfavorable variance. Other non-operating income primarily related to foreign currency losses represented the remaining variance.","Interest expense was up $14 million year-over-year due to higher average balances and higher interest rates. And interest in the second quarter related to the STAHLGRUBER financing was $11 million. Pre-tax income during the second quarter of 2018 was $218 million, down $8 million or 3% compared to the prior year.","Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.9% for the quarter. We updated our estimate of the annual effective tax rate during the second quarter to 27%, up 100 basis points from our previous estimate in Q1. The higher rate is driven mostly by the effects of the STAHLGRUBER transaction, including non-deductible interest and deal costs, as well as the higher effective tax rate in Germany. For your long-term forecasting, please note that about 60 basis points of the rate increase is related to non-deductible interest and deal costs, and should fall off in 2019.","Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the second quarter was $0.50, up $0.01 relative to the comparable quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, acquisition and divestiture-related gains and losses, and the tax benefit associated with stock-based comp, was $0.61, reflecting a 15% improvement.","STAHLGRUBER's results were consistent with the projected impact as we discussed during Investor Day with a negative impact on the quarter totaling approximately $0.02. While the STAHLGRUBER operating results were solid for the month of June, the negative impacts from pre-acquisition interest cost related to the euro note offerings, the tax impact from non-deductible interest cost, and the dilution effect from issuing 8 million shares caused the overall negative impact on the quarter, as we had communicated on May 31 at our Investor Day.","Moving to the segments, with North America on slide 16, gross margins during the second quarter were 43.1%, down 80 basis points over the 43.9% reported a year ago. The decrease was primarily attributable to mix, with strong revenue growth in some of our lower-margin product lines, including batteries and reman engines.","Additionally, we experienced some softening in salvage margins, as a result of increasing car costs. The base aftermarket business performed consistently with the prior year comparable period. And while we don't typically talk much about sequential changes, I want to highlight a few points related to activities in the second quarter.","Our second quarter gross margin percentage declined sequentially by 20 basis points. Though this variance was driven mostly by our self-service business as a result of the rising cost trend we referenced last quarter. On a positive note, our aftermarket business increased its gross margin percentage sequentially by 30 basis points.","The North American management team has made a good start towards addressing cost pressures, by adjusting net prices in aftermarket to boost margin without sacrificing revenue growth. We are encouraged by the progress the team made in the quarter and are optimistic about our ability to maintain these net pricing levels.","Moving on to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in our North America segment, these increased by 30 basis points compared to a year ago, but were down 20 basis points sequentially. Consistent with last quarter, we're still facing headwinds related to freight and fuel costs like many other distributors, and these costs drove a 60 basis point increase over the prior year. We are actively working to address these headwinds to the extent we can, given the macroeconomic scenario, including adjusting third-party freight costs to reduce freight surcharges, sourcing less expensive freight options, and resource management.","Going in the other direction, we had a partial offset of 30 basis points from a non-recurring charge in Q2 of 2017 related to a contingent liability. Non-operating income and expenses had a negative impact on segment EBITDA of 20 basis points in 2018, due to an increase in various miscellaneous expenses in the second quarter of 2018.","In total, segment EBITDA of North America during the second quarter of 2018 was $175 million, roughly flat compared to last year and as a percentage of revenue was down 130 basis points from the prior year quarter. Sequential EBITDA margin is down 30 basis points, which reflects a seasonal pattern in our North America business. Prior to 2018, four of the prior five years had lower margins in Q2 versus Q1 in a range of 20 to 140 basis points.","We also started to incur the incremental employee benefit costs as discussed on prior calls in Q2, which negatively impacted our sequential margin. In this context, we're encouraged by the relatively small sequential decrease, but we're clearly not where we think we can be.","Looking at slide 18, scrap prices were up 33% over the comparable quarter last year and flat relative to Q1 of 2018. The benefit from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing, as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time. As such, there was minimal year-over-year impact from changes in scrap prices on our reported results.","Moving on to our European segment on slide 19, gross margins in Europe were 36% in Q2, a 120 basis point decline over the comparable period of 2017. The decrease is attributable largely to our UK operations and to the mix shift given the acquisitions and organic growth of the Central and Eastern European region which has structurally lower margins.","As we've discussed over the past few months, the migration issues with our T2 facility in the first quarter had an ongoing negative impact in Q2, as some of the incremental costs capitalized into inventory were recorded in the income statement as the inventory turned. Going forward, we expect to see the remaining incremental capitalized costs flow through COGS in the second half of the year, primarily in Q3.","We did have some positive news on gross margins in Europe with our centralized procurement, yielding a 30 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs. Also, our Sator business in the Benelux region showed continuing margin expansion, contributing a 30 basis point improvement to the segment with a specific strength in private label sales and the ongoing move from a three-step to a two-step model in that market. The STAHLGRUBER impact on gross margin percentage was immaterial in the quarter.","With respect to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we experienced a 30 basis point decrease on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter a year ago. The improvement was primarily attributable to leverage as we could grow revenue at a greater rate than our costs, including facility, freight and advertising expenses. European segment EBITDA totaled $111 million, a 33% increase over a year ago.","As shown on slide 21, relative to the second quarter of 2017, the British pound was up 6% and the euro had strengthened 8% against the U.S. dollar. Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 8.6% for Q2 2018, down 80 basis points from the same period a year ago. Our goal for Europe remains double-digit segment EBITDA margins over the next 36 months.","Excluding the impact of the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, which was dilutive by 10 basis points, Q2 was a step in the right direction with a sequential margin improvement of 130 basis points. We have more work to do and the European management team are intensely focused on this task.","Related to Europe, I'd also like to share some news on our equity interest in Mekonomen, a leading car parts and service chain in the Nordic region. We don't control the entity and so do not consolidate Mekonomen's results in our reported figures. Instead, we record our share of its income in the equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries line on our income statement.","Since we acquired our shares of Mekonomen, its market cap has declined by approximately 25% as of June 30. While we concluded that no permanent impairment has occurred as of June 30, we will be monitoring developments closely over the next quarter as we evaluate the possibility of an impairment. That said, we remain optimistic about Mekonomen's future prospects, including its recently announced acquisition in Denmark and Poland. And we look forward to continuing our partnership with them in Europe.","Turning to our Specialty segment on slide 22, the business continues to deliver solid results. The Warn business is performing well and, as previously disclosed, has a higher margin profile than the base Specialty segment. Warn contributed 90 basis points to the growth in the gross margin percentage. The base Specialty business, i.e. without Warn, generated a 4.1% organic revenue growth rate in the quarter, which was a nice rebound from Q1 and we were encouraged that we were able to do so, while maintaining gross margin expansion.","Specialty underwent a program to rationalize some low-margin business which had a positive impact on the overall gross margin percentage in the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were 120 basis points higher relative to the prior year. The primary variances related to higher personnel, vehicle and fuel expenses and the impact of Warn, which has a higher overhead expense structure than the base business. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $56 million, up 15% from Q2 of 2017. And as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 20 basis points to 13.6%.","Moving on to capital allocation and the balance sheet, as presented on slide 24 you will note that our cash flow from continuing operations for the first six months of 2018 was $329 million. We talked in February about the growth in inventory related to buying opportunities in our North American business.","In the first half of the year, we've maintained a modest cash outflow of $13 million related to inventory, as we could support our strong organic growth without a significant investment in inventory. Receivables represent an outflow through the first six months which follows the seasonality of the business with our highest sales in the first half of the year.","Payables represent a $25 million outflow through June of this year, which is nearly a $90 million swing to the negative relative to a year ago. Payables fluctuate from period to period based on purchasing activity and timing of payments. Payables is one of the more volatile line items on the cash flow, and historically we've seen periods with inflows followed by outflows and vice versa. So, I expect to see some bounce-back in the second half. Overall, we remain optimistic about our ability to generate strong cash flows from operations for the full year of 2018.","CapEx for the quarter was $53 million and $115 million for the year-to-date period. The largest capital changes reflect the impact of the STAHLGRUBER transaction. In April, we issued \u20ac1 billion senior notes in 8- and 10-year tranches at a weighted average rate of 3.75% to fund the STAHLGRUBER transaction. Additionally, we borrowed approximately $80 million on our line of credit and issued 8.1 million shares to complete the financing of the transaction.","Moving to slide 25, as of June 30, we had approximately $4.5 billion of total debt outstanding and $345 million of cash, resulting in a net debt number of about $4.1 billion or 3.1 times last 12 months EBITDA. Excluding the STAHLGRUBER transaction, with the debt pay-down in the first quarter and a further pay-down in the second quarter totaling $162 million for the first six months, we continue to make good progress in reducing our net leverage.","At this net debt ratio, our credit facility margin increased by 25 basis points in June. So, we'll see a higher interest cost on all of our credit facility borrowings until we reduce our net leverage ratio below the 2.75 times tier of the credit facility. The impact of this interest rate increase was included in our STAHLGRUBER accretion estimate. And finally, we have approximately $1.6 billion of availability on our credit facility, which together with our cash yields total liquidity of $1.9 billion.","With that said, I'll turn the call back to Nick to cover the updated guidance.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Varun. In light of the results achieved in the second quarter and the closing of STAHLGRUBER, we have adjusted our annual guidance on a few of the key financial metrics. With respect to organic growth for parts and services, we anticipate all the segments will continue to report reasonably strong results, though not quite at very high levels achieved in the second quarter. Accordingly, we have adjusted the bottom end of the full year guidance range for global organic growth up from 4% to 4.5% and have kept the top end of the range steady at 5.5%.","In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we have moved the range up to $2.25 to $2.33 a share, with a midpoint of $2.29. This reflects both the better-than-anticipated results for the second quarter, the anticipated accretion from the STAHLGRUBER transaction, offset by the weaker euro and sterling which are down 4% and 6% respectively from when we set guidance last quarter, and the slight uptick in the estimated effective tax rate as we continue to refine the impact of the tax law changes and the STAHLGRUBER acquisition.","Currencies and taxes collectively account for approximately a negative $0.04 a share impact relative to our prior guidance. So, as to be clear, starting with the midpoint of our prior guidance which was $2.25 a share, we added $0.05 for STAHLGRUBER, $0.03 for the strong Q2, and then backed off the $0.04 for the negative currency and tax rate impacts to get to the new midpoint of $2.29 a share. Those adjustments yield a range for adjusted net income of $710 million to $735 million.","We also anticipate that the higher earnings will have a positive impact on cash flow from operations and have revised the guidance range to $660 million on the low end and $710 million at the high end, a $35 million increase. We have also increased our capital spending plan a bit to a range of $255 million to $285 million, reflecting the inclusion of STAHLGRUBER and the addition of a few large facility expansion opportunities, primarily in our North American wholesale operations.","We believe the effective tax rate will be approximately 27% and the guidance assumes the current levels as it relates to FX rates. This guidance does not include any impact from the pending tariffs nor does it assume any meaningful impact from scrap price fluctuations, though there is a reasonable amount of speculation in the market that prices may come under pressure if the Chinese restrict the amount of imported recycled material.","In closing, I am very proud of the hard work and dedication of our 49,000 employees and I am equally proud of the team's efforts to effectively address the headwinds encountered in the first quarter. While we have made good progress, there is substantial room for improvement and I am confident in our team's ability to effectively implement their respective plans.","Finally, I would like to publicly welcome the entire STAHLGRUBER organization to the LKQ team. We could not be more excited to have you as our colleagues and partners, and we look forward to working with you in the months and years ahead.","And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Nick, I realize the trade dynamics are fluid, but a bigger picture, how would you frame your sourcing exposure geographically? I guess, I'm asking, for example, what percentage of European costs of goods sold would be sourced from Europe, the U.S.A. and China and maybe the same question for the U.S., just so we can put some context around these tariffs.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Craig, and good morning. Yeah. The tariff issue is trying to hit a moving target, right, because there's five different programs under two different trade statutes that are somewhere between 40 years old and 60 years old that are currently at play. The reality is in our North American business, the entirety of the salvage supply chain is from the U.S. So, there's no impact related to our salvage business.","The vast majority of our aftermarket product comes from Taiwan. And Taiwan is not deemed to be China. So, it's not really impacted by the tariffs that are exclusively kind of focused on China. But the last of the five programs which has very little detail around it, Craig, relates to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 where the President is talking about putting a 20% or 25% tariff on all imported automobiles and auto parts. But that's on a country-by-country specific basis, and they haven't been clear as to what countries are included in that. So, that's probably potentially the biggest exposure.","When you look at the original tariff item related to steel and aluminum under Section 232, there is really no impact on us because that really related to raw materials. Under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, there's three different rounds. Round one put the tariffs on 818, what they call, tariff headings. That went into effect actually on July 6, so that's real and live. We have about 60 products that fall under those 818 headings and so the tariff impact there will be less than $5 million.","Round two, which was proposed on June 20, it put a 25% surcharge on another 284 tariff headings, and we think the impact there is rather minimal. The round three, which was just kind of introduced as a possibility a couple weeks ago, put another 10% surcharge on another 6,031 tariff headings. And that's probably going to have a bigger impact actually on our PGW business, because a lot of the windshields that we distribute on the aftermarket side come from China and our Specialty business, if you will.","We don't see a lot of impact on our European business from the tariff structure and the trade issues that are in the press these days, because almost all of the inventory that we sell in Europe is procured either from European or Asian sources. We're not buying product from the U.S. and moving it over to Europe. So, hopefully that helps.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","It does. Thank you, Nick.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, and congratulations on the quarter B.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Ryan.","Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC","So, I have a question on North America aftermarket gross margins. I think \u2013 it sounds like you've made some progress on passing along product price increases that you've seen from your suppliers, along with passing on for higher freight. Did I hear that correctly? And then, the second part of that question is, by the end of the year, do you think you'll make more progress such that price\/cost in that aftermarket piece can be neutralized?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Hey, Ryan, good morning. It's Varun Laroyia calling in. Yes, listen, to your question about aftermarket, the base business, which is our traditional crash parts, we have been able to offset some of the margin pressures. As we'd mentioned, our recovery plans are well underway. The North American management team has been working hard on these pieces and they continue to go through tiers of customers, as we had spoken about previously. So, yes, they've made good progress.","But again, as we'd mentioned previously, given the size and scale of the activity, this element will keep ramping up through the second half also. So, while we were in a position to essentially get our aftermarket margins flat on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter versus where they were trending previously, so that's been stabilized. And, yes, we do expect that piece to continue to ramp up through the back end of the year.","Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","I want to ask about, in North America, the relationship between organic growth and margins. I suspect April was a challenge to the quarter as it relates to the disparity in demand across geographies that you saw in the first quarter. And I'm just curious as to how much of that sustained inclement weather into April lifted organic growth, but also suppressed gross margins. And then, as we think about the sequential move into the back half of the year, do you think you can show margins up year-over-year in the back half?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Ben, this is Nick. I'll start and I'll let Varun jump in afterwards. So, there's no doubt that the demand in our North American business, particularly on the collision side of the business, has been very strong. You saw some very good growth in Q1, some continued excellent growth in Q2 and that growth was really pretty consistent throughout the quarter. On the margin side, we were coming off of a soft Q1 and so the margins in the quarter actually got better as we marched through the three months of the quarter. That's why Varun indicated just a moment ago that we anticipate that we're going to continue to make good progress through the back half of the year.","But, Varun, do you want to add?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. Hey, Ben, good morning. Yes. Listen, I think to the second part of your question in terms of what we anticipate versus a year ago for North America margins and if you turn to slide 16 of the earnings deck, you'll see that the first half typically is a strong set of results for us from a margin perspective. And then, typically seasonality does tend to play its part with regards to mix.","So, for example, in the first half of the year, we do tend to have more collision parts in the North America mix and that typically tends to tail off. But if you think about the dip that we have traditionally experienced first half to the second half, we don't expect that to be as significant to what we've seen in prior years. So, back to the point about a year ago 12.9% and 12.7% in Q3 and Q4 for North American margins, we would not see that, call it, 160, 170-point decline from the first half that we just reported for 2018.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Understood. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate taking the question.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Jamie.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Wanted to ask sort of more of a strategic question and congratulations on closing STAHLGRUBER. But wanted to look \u2013 kind of looking ahead and you traditionally take some time off after larger scale deals like STAHLGRUBER. But wanted to see kind of what your view was on sort of the growth strategy looking out over the longer term. Or are you at a size now where it makes more sense to sort of reinvest in sort of internally making sure the margin trajectories in North America, Europe and so forth sort of stabilize and start to grow again? And we can kind of think of this as about sort of optimizing the portfolio you have versus growing via acquisition and sort of via roll-up into the future.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Jamie, this is Nick. And I'll just take everyone back to May 31 at our Investor Day at T2. And what we mentioned then is we've just come off the largest acquisition in the history of the company, the acquisition of STAHLGRUBER which, again, we are thrilled to have as part of our family of companies and we think there's huge benefits that will accrue in the years to come, but that's \u2013 there's a big integration to go on there. But the reality is we expect to do both. We'll continue to grow our business through acquisition over the next three to five years.","Having said that, we also need to optimize \u2013 I think that's the word to use and I think it was a very good choice of words \u2013 we need to optimize what we currently owned. And so, it's not really an either\/or. As I indicated back on May 31, no one should expect another blockbuster transaction, anything close to something like STAHLGRUBER in the near term, right, because we have a lot on our plate and we're going to be focused on making sure we get the integration right.","But over time as our leverage comes down and the like, if and when the right opportunity arises, we would be willing to again do something on a slightly larger scale, but we need to get our \u2013 we need to get STAHLGRUBER integrated, we need to get our leverage down. But that doesn't in any way, shape or form take our eye off the ball of optimizing what we own, getting the margins up in not \u2013 in all of our businesses really. Again, we've been very clear about the goals in Europe. We absolutely want to drive higher margins in North America. There's a lot of blocking and tackling that goes into that. And so, we're focused on both.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much, Nick, and best of luck.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Bret.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Hey, good morning.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Could you give us an update where we are as far as sort of purchasing synergies in Europe? I think you said you picked up 30 bps on some supplier rebates. But maybe how much of our purchasing has been consolidated and you talked at Sator about the private label programs, how are we across the board in private label and maybe percentage mix, and where you see that going?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Hey, Bret, it's Varun. Good morning. Yeah. Listen, in terms of our overall European procurement program, continues to make great strides. We have a team that's been actively working with our key suppliers, and so that's how you've kind of seen that improvement come through on a year-over-year basis. We haven't given exact numbers in terms of what level has been covered at this point of time.","But clearly, I can assure you, we'd call it 45 to 50 days into the STAHLGRUBER transaction, the teams have been spending a lot of quality time out there also to consolidate as to what the opportunity is with the STAHLGRUBER transaction, obviously net pricing analysis being done on several thousand SKUs at this point of time. And so, we remain optimistic not only about the STAHLGRUBER purchasing synergies, but the overall European procurement program.","With regards to your second part of the question on Benelux and Sator, yes, absolutely. Listen, we've talked about this previously, the rise of private label brands. Certainly, Sator has been making great strides on that from that perspective. But really, I'll probably take you back in terms of one of our core critical businesses, ECP. They're the ones that have actually been going down the path of the private label brands.","So, they've certainly shown the path to the European teams. Sator has picked up on that also. And then, obviously, we do know through our equity investment in Mekonomen in terms of the margin profile of private label brands. So, we do see that to be a key pillar for our European margins getting to that double-digit EBITDA margin rate by the end of the 36-month period that started January 2018.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. And, Bret, what I would add is, obviously, when you make a large acquisition, you don't get the procurement savings day one, right? So, if you go back to when we bought Rhiag back in 2016, we put out some broad guidance as to what we thought we could get from a procurement benefit across the European platform by combining purchasing, negotiating kind of common elements, common contracts with our suppliers, if you will. At the time, we thought we could get $10 million of procurement. And we're very well on the way of getting that.","With respect to STAHLGRUBER, we really won't see the benefit of that really until very late in the first year of acquisition, which would put us into kind of mid-2019. One is you need to go and actually renegotiate some of the contracts, then you need to actually start buying at those new levels. But then you need to turn the inventory, right? And so, there's a little bit of a time lag, but we are very confident in our ability to really get our arms around all of the procurement savings that we've noted, both as it relates to the historical acquisitions and obviously as it relates to STAHLGRUBER.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Do you have a feeling for what percentage of your sales are private label?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","It really varies business by business. We don't disclose this, but ECP has the highest level of private label and STAHLGRUBER probably has the lowest level of private label business. And Sator and Rhiag are kind of in between, if you will.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning. I was hoping given the rapid moves in commodity, and just give us a quick refresh, a primer on the puts and takes to your P&L. So you're hit on the self-service side, but what about your core North American wholesale business? That's where you have inventory on hand. Initially, you would think increases are positive to get LIFO liquidations, but as you kind of turn through it, how should we be thinking about them? How that impacts margins?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, the impact to commodities has a very little impact on our, what we call our full-service North American salvage business, if you will. These are the cars that we're buying at auction and dismantling. Because the real commodity play there is the scrap. And the scrap is a couple hundred dollars on a $2,000 purchase for which we're hoping to park the car out for maybe north of $4,000. So, there's a very little impact. Biggest impact clearly on the self-serve business where the majority of the revenue from the self-serve, more than 50% of the revenue is actually from the residual metals that we end up selling off in the form of scrap.","On the aftermarket part side in North America, a lot of the product that we bring in from the Far East is either made of steel, think about hoods and fenders and the like, or plastics. The shallow, the mirror, the bumper covers, grills and so resin prices are really key there. And so, like in any business as the cost of raw materials for the suppliers that we buy from moves around, they're going to try and recoup some of their cost through higher selling prices to their customers. And we've seen a little bit of that, we talked about that in Q1. We're doing what we can to adjust our prices to take care of that.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. Okay.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Does that help?","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. That does help. And then as a related follow-up, you had referenced in the call something, the effective \u2013 the Chinese considering pulling back from purchasing recycled materials. Just want to get your \u2013 what are the puts and takes that they actually do do that? Do you have less competition for buying parts? Are there like lateral effects that we should be aware of? And then, like do you have an ability to source more aftermarket to offset that, if it is problematic? Just overall picture there would be helpful.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, the reference that I made about the Chinese is earlier this year, the Chinese government put in regulations to effectively limit the volume of recycled materials. That's everything from paper to cardboard to metals and the like flowing into China. And really as it related to metals is they wanted a cleaner source of metals because sometimes when the metals that they were bringing into the country, you think about copper wiring, right, the copper is always coated with something, fabric or plastic and the like. And they basically put a halt on the importation of some of that material.","And so, at first, their ports weren't fully compliant with the law and more recently we're hearing that they are by the end of the year going to put a hard stop. And that's going to have potentially an impact on prices. We just don't know where. But that's why I made the comment. The reality is, again, in our core North American business, most of the product comes in from Taiwan. Taiwan is deemed to be a different country. And so, the Chinese import laws as it relates to recycled materials do not relate to Taiwan.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much, Nick, Varun and Joe, for taking the question. Could we look at page 17 on your deck, and could you help us bridge what is in the 90 basis points of headwind from gross margin? What's making up that 90 basis points so we understand what you're dealing with and can get a hand around?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Michael, good morning. It's Varun Laroyia out here. Yeah, listen, going back to the margin decline on a year-over-year basis in our North America business, really it's the vast majority of it is mix driven. If you think about the base aftermarket business, as I mentioned on the call, and then to one of the questions earlier also, that was pretty much comparable on a prior year period.","But if you think about the strong revenue growth similar to what we had called out even in Q1 in some of our lower-margin product lines, think about batteries, this is coming off the FCA Mopar deal that we announced and essentially got the first full quarter in Q1. While it has contributed to organic revenue, we are nowhere close to getting the margins that we would on our traditional aftermarket crash parts, or for that matter reman engines. Again, great from a revenue growth perspective, but again significantly lower-margin business.","And then, finally, with the salvage side of it, also specifically on our self-service business, the rising car cost trend as a result of scrap metal prices going up, that obviously doesn't allow us to get the same level of margin for the parts we pick off those vehicles. So, that really is what comprises the kind of 90 basis points kind of down on a year-over-year basis.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. But can you give us the actual portions of that? So, how much of this is batteries versus reman engines versus salvage?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Michael, we don't typically disclose that entire piece in terms of what the key elements of that would be. But if you think about the key components, roughly call it 50 basis points, 30 basis points, 20 basis points between aftermarket, the salvage, self-service operations. So, that really is what we say. So, again, I would not call out anything that was de minimis, but again full-service and salvage are a key piece of it. And in the aftermarket, outside of the base business, which has some of the lower-margin product line that also roll up, those are the key pieces.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, if I may follow on it, when we were in England and the presentations were given, there was a high degree of confidence that the company would return to the starting year margin by year-end. Is that still the case in North America?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yes. Well, if you think about \u2013 when we've kind of broken out our Q1 headwinds specifically on the gross margin piece of it, you'll recall one of the key pieces we had called out were rising commodity prices in our traditional aftermarket crash part piece. And so, I think that really is where the key piece was.","The team has been successful in being able to offset those prices. But with regards to the mix, given what we see from scrap metal prices in the full-service salvage or for that matter what we've seen come through on some of the other product lines, that is something, will just be a mix piece. So, to the time we don't lap the comps on, say, the battery business which will be in Q1 of 2019, we will see that, but in terms of that is a small part of our business, but the big base of our North America wholesale by far is the aftermarket. And that's trending well. Okay?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Stephanie.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Stephanie. And again, welcome to the LKQ call and we appreciate you initiating coverage on us.","Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Absolutely. Thank you. So, just kind of looking back at the European margins during the quarter, obviously, a lot of moving parts. Just looking at the apparent mix between Western Europe and Eastern Europe and just kind of the margin gap there, is there anything near term or long term that can be done to kind of close the gap between those two regions' margin structure?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Stephanie, the difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe, that's really structural, if you will, almost across the board and we've seen financial statements from a lot of different companies, obviously, all over Europe. The Eastern Bloc just structurally has lower gross margins and lower EBITDA margins. The market there seems to be willing to work for just a lower level of profitability. And to be competitive, our Eastern Bloc countries also have lower margins than in the West.","We think that's going to persist for the foreseeable future. We don't see a huge shift in the market. That said, we still believe we can earn a good return on capital on the Eastern Bloc operations, if you will, because those companies are growing a lot faster. And so from an absolute euro perspective, if you will, we can grow the EBITDA faster in Eastern Europe than Western Europe just because of the top line growth.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","The only one additional piece I'll add to just complement Nick's comments here, are if you go back to our Investor Day and John had laid out the key pillars of the margin enhancement for our European business, there was some of the slightly longer-term initiatives which will actually benefit all of our European segment. So, things such as logistics and warehousing optimization or for that matter shared services, back office, rationalizing the infrastructure side a bit, that certainly is a slightly longer-term piece of it, but that really allows us to make some significant moves into our cost structure.","So, as Nick mentioned, the margin is what those markets will bear. But in terms of us being able to further optimize relative to competition given our size, scale and footprint in that region, we believe we will be best-in-class even on segment EBITDA margins relative to competition in that market.","Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Very helpful. Well, thanks so much.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Scott Stember with C.L. King & Associates. Your line is open.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Scott.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Can we just maybe just go back to price increases that we have talked about in the aftermarket business in North America? Last quarter you guys had talked about having to be careful with raising prices, just given the fact that you need to stay within a certain pocket below the comparable OEM prices. Can you maybe just talk about what you're experiencing on that front and maybe that just will give us a gauge of how quickly you can get through the price increases that you need altogether? Thanks.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Scott. I mean, the reality is in Q2 and true going forward, it has less to do with actually raising prices and it has more to do to make sure that the level of discounts that we're giving to our customers are actually earned. The reality is not everyone earns the same level of discount. And clearly, the bigger customers who buy large volumes consistently over a longer period of time get a higher level of discount off a list than the smaller customers, and it's making sure that our sales team is being incredibly rigorous and focused on giving the right level of discount.","And that's where we've made some progress here in Q2. We think we're going to make continued progress through the back half of the year. And it gets you to the same spot, right, that if you're really being more disciplined on the level of discounts, if that can increase revenue that helps obviously improve your margins, if you will. But again, we want to be \u2013 we are very careful. It's a tightrope that we need to walk. We don't want to turn off the revenue growth by being too aggressive on the price front, right, because at the end of the day, we want to continue to take market share and we want to continue to broaden the overall base.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. That's all I have. Thanks.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Okay. Great.

Again, we think we had a great quarter, but we're not done, and we're working really hard and we'll continue to focus on improving the margins of all of our businesses around the globe. And we look forward to sharing our further progress with you at the end of October when we report third quarter results. And we hope to have another good report for you at that point in time.

Hopefully everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. As normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. In Q1, revenue reached a new quarterly high of $1.77 billion, an increase of 9.1% as compared to $1.63 billion in the first quarter of 2014. Net income for the first quarter of 2015 was $107.1 million, an increase of 2.3%, as compared to $104.7 million for the same period of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, increased 2.9% from $0.34 for the first quarter of 2014. Please note that adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2015 would have been $0.36 compared to $0.35 for the first quarter of 2014 after adjusting for net losses resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, loss on debt extinguishment in 2014 and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.","Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 7.5% for the quarter, following an extremely tough comp from last year. I am particularly pleased with the sequential improvement in the EBITDA margin of our wholesale European segment, which increased 130 basis points in the quarter. Nick will provide more color around margins momentarily.","Now moving on to operations. During the first quarter, we purchased nearly 70,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 3.1% decrease compared to Q1 2014. I want to put some context around the drop in our dismantling procurement. During our third quarter 2014 earnings call, I indicated that we adjusted our procurement strategy for our salvage inventory by focusing on buying a better quality car that would part-out for additional revenue. The intent of this strategy was to drive incremental revenue and gross margin dollars. Though we are still working through the selling cycle, I am encouraged with the initial results, despite lower procurement volumes.","Since implementing this strategy, our salvage organic revenue growth has outperformed our overall North American organic growth. Thus far, in Q2, sequentially, our procurement and pricing are trending favorably with ample volume at the auction. With inventory already on hand and a continuation of our current run rate for acquiring cars, we should have sufficient inventory for our recycled parts operations.","In our self-service retail business, during the first quarter, we acquired approximately 100,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars as compared to 120,000 in Q1 of 2014 or roughly a 16% decrease. Similar to last quarter, this decrease was intentional given the continued downward trend in scrap prices and a continued pressure on margins. Also, regarding scrap, it is important to note that scrap will continue to become a smaller portion of our global revenue mix, which we believe will reduce our exposure to unexpected surprises in our earnings stream. For further context on this point, at the end of Q1 2011, a period before we diversified our business into Europe and Specialty, the other revenue line was over 16% of our revenue versus 7.3% at the end of Q1 2015.","Lastly, in North America, in April 2015, we renewed our designed patent license agreement with Ford. The license agreement grants LKQ the exclusive right to distribute aftermarket replicas of Ford automotive parts covered by U.S. design patents. The renewal is on a substantially the same terms as the previous agreement, except that the term now extends until March of 2020. LKQ and Ford have forged a mutually beneficial relationship that helps ensure that customers continue to have a choice between original equipment and non-OE automotive parts.","Now moving to our European operations. In Q1, our Wholesale European segment had acquisition growth of 12.7% and organic revenue growth of 14%, which was offset by a decrease of 10.7% related to the foreign exchange rates. ECP continued its double-digit performance by posting organic revenue growth of 16.8% in the quarter and for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 10.2%.","In addition, during Q1, our collision parts revenue with ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 34%, despite a mild U.K. winter. We believe that this growth demonstrates that our 17 insurance partners in the U.K. recognize the value proposition of our alternative parts offering. During the quarter, ECP opened a total of 3 branches, bringing our network total to 192 branch locations.","Turning to our Sator business. During the quarter, Sator witnessed some gross margin benefit year-over-year, primarily from the shift in its network from a 3-step to a 2-step model. I am particularly pleased with Sator's 5.3% organic growth in the quarter. We believe that we've successfully weathered any further fallout from our customer base as a result of this new distribution model. Also, during the quarter, Sator acquired 2 additional distributors of aftermarket automotive products in the Netherlands, 1 of which closed on April 1. These 2 acquisitions added an additional 8 locations in the market, bringing Sator's branch network to 72. As I noted on our last call, additional acquisitions in the pipeline and the innovative partner strategy should see us complete our national footprint in the Netherlands by the year end with a target count of circa 80 branches.","Now on to the Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year revenue growth of 36% in the quarter, including the benefit of Stag Parkway and organic revenue growth of 6.3%.","In Q1, our Specialty team made continued progress on synergy and cost-saving initiatives with Stag Parkway by closing and integrating 4 additional warehouses. We expect the balance of the identified Stag locations to be closed and fully integrated by year-end.","Turning to our acquisition activity and pipeline. In addition to the Netherlands distributors, during the first quarter of 2015, the company also acquired a salvage business located in Nebraska.","I am pleased with the diligent efforts of our development team and our team's ongoing integration efforts. We continue to see a robust pipeline of opportunities to acquire businesses that fit our growth strategy in each operating segment.","At this time, I'd like to ask John and Nick to provide more detail and perspective on the financial results of the quarter.","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Rob. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'll give a little color on the overall company results. In a moment, Nick will address the segment details, the balance sheet and the guidance.","Q1 2015 saw LKQ reach a number of significant milestones. It was our first quarter with revenue reaching an annualized run rate over $7 billion with a Q1 revenue annualizing of $7.1 billion. And this is also the first time we exceeded $210 million of EBITDA in a quarter. These accomplishments were completed even in the face of a severe drop of scrap steel prices.","Getting to the specifics in the quarter, beginning with revenue, our Q1 2015 revenue were $1,774,000,000, was an increase of $148 million compared to Q1 last year, or an increase of 9.1%. For Q1, our total organic revenue growth was 5.1% and we delivered an additional growth of 7.5% from acquisitions with foreign exchange negatively impacting total revenue by 3.4%.","Rob mentioned that the Q1 2015 organic growth of Parts and Services was 7.5%. We completed 2 small acquisitions in Q1 2015, which were and are expected to be immaterial to revenue.","Total change in other revenue, which is where we recorded our scrap commodity sales was negative 17.4%. That was mainly due to the negative organic growth of 17.7% with a small acquisition growth in foreign exchange almost offsetting each other.","As Rob mentioned, we saw purchases of cars down in the quarter year-over-year. In the recycling line of business, we've been targeting a better quality car, whereas in the self-service line of business, we adjusted our buying to account for the difficult scrap environment, a process we started in Q4 2014. Some of that volume decrease will impact Q2 when we scrap those cars. The decrease in volume offset some of the fall in scrap steel prices we experienced year-over-year and helped reduce the impact of lower scrap compared to what we had anticipated on the February call.","The average price we received for scrap steel was approximately 37% lower year-over-year at $141 per ton this year versus $224 per ton in Q1 2014.","Other revenue was 7.3% of total revenue as compared to 9.6% for the same period last year and has continued the trend of becoming a lower percentage of and less significant to, our total revenue.","In Q1 2015, revenue for our Self-serve business was $85 million or 4.8% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 42% of this revenue was parts sales included in North American parts and services revenue and 58% scrap and core sales included in other revenue. A year ago, in Q1 2014, our Self-serve business was 6.4% of our revenue and that percentage has been falling as scrap prices fell and as we've grown our other lines of business.","Our reported gross margin for Q1 2015 was $699 million or 39.4% of revenue, a decline of approximately 70 basis points from our gross margin percentage of 40.1% in Q1 2014. Fifty basis points of the decline was due to mix with lower-margin European and Specialty businesses growing faster than North America. North American margins were 10 basis points lower, which is primarily due to scrap pricing. We estimated that the drop in scrap prices impacted EPS by $0.02, which equates to approximately $10 million of gross margin impact. Without this headwind, North American would have seen improvement in gross margins. Specialty gross margins were lower, primarily due to the acquisitions we completed in Q4 of 2014.","Moving on to operating expenses. Facility and warehouse cost improved from 7.8% of revenue in Q1 2014 to 7.5% in Q1 this year. This improvement is primarily due to mix caused by the growth in our Specialty and European segments, which tend to run lower facility costs than the North American segment.","Distribution costs were 8% of revenue this quarter, down from 8.4% in the same quarter of last year. The primary reason for this improvement was due to lower fuel expenses.","Selling and G&A expenses increased from 11.4% of revenue in Q1 last year to 11.5% in Q1 this year. This reflects cost in the Netherlands associated with the move to a 2-step distribution model, which was responsible for a 20-basis-point increase and that was offset by a 10-basis-point improvement in the Specialty segment as we achieved synergies following the acquisitions. The combination of facility and warehouse distribution and SG&A costs was 27% of revenue in Q1 2015 as compared to 27.6% in Q1 2014.","It's worth noting that the drop in other revenues was probably masking additional leverage we achieved in the base business. It's hard to accurately quantify the exact impact, but as I've pointed out in the past, other revenue tends to incur very little incremental cost on these line items. So it's likely an improvement in leverage being masked by the lower scrap in core revenue. We estimate this improvement in the 30 to 50 basis-point range.","During Q1 2015, we recorded $6.5 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, up from $3.3 million in Q1 last year. The 2015 cost primarily related to the restructuring cost in the Specialty segment. Depreciation and amortization was 1.7% of revenue during Q1 this year as compared to 1.6% of revenue in Q1 2014, reflecting higher capital spending and the impact of acquisitions on amortization.","Other expenses, net, increased to $16.8 million in the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, compared to $15.1 million in the same period last year, an increase of $1.7 million. Year-over-year, net interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment was $1.5 million favorable, offset by contingent consideration liabilities, which were $1.4 million of unfavorable and greater foreign exchange losses of $1.8 million.","Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 3.4%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.5% compared to 34.0% in Q1 last year. The increase rate reflects mix with a higher portion of pretax income in the higher tax rate United States and a $700,000 unfavorable discrete charge in Q1 2015.","On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.35 in Q1 2015 compared to $0.34 in Q1 2014, an improvement of 2.9%. Adjusting for the combination of acquisition-related expenses, contingent purchase price adjustments and the loss on the debt extinguish, EPS would have been $0.01 higher both this year and last. So on an adjusted basis, Q1 2015 would've been $0.36 as compared to $0.35 last year.","I'd also point out that the strengthening U.S. dollar causes our reported foreign exchange earnings to be lower. We estimate the net impact of the stronger dollar added $0.02 negative impact on Q1 2015 earnings per share.","With that, I'd like to pass over to Nick Zarcone to provide some details regarding these segments and some color on our outlook.","Dominick P. Zarcone","Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm delighted to be part of the LKQ leadership team and I look forward to sharing our financial results with you for many quarters to come. While John has provided an overview of our consolidated results, I'd like to take a few minutes to address our 3 segments: North America, Europe, and Specialty products, particularly as it relates to some of the margin dynamics.","North American parts and services revenue during the first quarter grew 5.1% compared to last year, most of which represented organic growth. You may recall that Q1 of 2014 was a particularly harsh winter, which resulted in our then-strongest ever quarter. So we knew it was going to be a tough comparison and we are very pleased with these results.","In Europe, revenue was up 16% on a year-over-year basis with organic growth of 14% and acquisition growth of 12.7% being modified by the 10.7% negative impact in the movement in FX rates. To put that latter point into perspective, converting the Q1 2015 local currency results, including the acquired revenue at the lower exchange rates, reduced European revenue by approximately $60 million compared to where revenue would have been had the FX rates remained constant at 2014 levels.","And as mentioned, revenue for the Specialty segment grew 36%, combining 6% organic growth and 31% acquisition growth, the latter being the result of the Stag Parkway acquisition that was completed in Q4 of 2014.","So organic growth from parts and services was 7.5% on a global basis, which is consistent with the guidance provided during our last call. And as mentioned by John, the significant drop in scrap prices led to a 17% decline in other revenue, bringing total organic growth down to 5.1%.","When thinking about profitability, it is important to remember that each of our 3 operating segments have different margin characteristics, with our North American segment historically having the highest gross margin and EBITDA margins. As a result, when looking over time periods, a significant portion of the change in margins on a consolidated basis can be attributable to the change in revenue mix. In the first quarter of 2015, North America fell to 59% of global revenue compared to 63.3% during the comparable period of 2014. This largely reflects the impact of the acquisitions in our European and Specialty businesses during 2014, which have further diversified the revenue stream.","As highlighted in the press release, consolidated EBITDA margins fell from 12.5% in the first quarter of 2014 to 12% in the first quarter of 2015. Most all of that change was the result of 2 items: one, higher restructuring cost related to the integration of Stag Parkway into our Specialty business as we closed overlapping facilities, incurred-related moving expenses and terminated redundant staff; second, we experienced an increase in the losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries.","Importantly, segment EBITDA, which excludes the impact of restructuring charges and the results of unconsolidated subs, increased 7.9% in the first quarter compared to last year to $221 million from $205 million. Segment EBITDA margins were 12.5% in the most recent quarter compared to 12.6% last year. Again, most all of the change was due to a shift in our revenue mix.","Gross margins in North America were slightly lower in Q1 of 2015, as improved pricing on the aftermarket side was more than offset by a decline in the salvage margins, particularly due to the significant decline in scrap prices and the change in purchasing strategy that Rob mentioned toward newer, higher-priced salvage vehicles, which generate higher parts sales and dollars but slightly lower gross margins.","EBITDA margins of the North American segment were 14.3% during the most recent quarter, which is up 10 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. As one would expect, given the seasonality of the business, on a sequential basis, first quarter margins were up significantly from the 12.8% we reported in Q4 of last year. Remember, Q1 tends to be our strongest quarter of the year in this segment.","Notwithstanding the negative drag related to the lower scrap prices, these are the best Q1 margins posted by our North American segment in several years as we experienced leverage in the distribution system due in part to the decline in fuel prices.","The gross margin of our Specialty segment fell about 80 basis points due to the acquisition of the Stag Parkway RV-related business in Q4 of 2014. Stag Parkway traditionally has had lower gross margins than our KAO operation. That said, EBITDA margins for the Specialty segment increased by 40 basis points to 10.5% in Q1 of 2015 compared to 10.1% in Q1 of the prior year and ahead of the seasonal low of 7.3% recorded in Q4 of last year. This was largely due to the realization of logistic synergies associated with the rationalizing the distribution network of the acquired business. So it was an excellent performance for this segment and solid evidence that the integration of the recent acquisition is on track.","With respect to Europe, gross margins in the first quarter remained constant with the comparable period of 2014. We experienced a slight decline in gross margins in the U.K. related to a shift in revenue toward national accounts, but that was wholly offset by an increase in margin on the continent, reflecting the internalization of incremental gross margin from the acquired distributors as part of our 3 to 2 distribution strategy.","As you may recall, the EBITDA margins of our European segment fell by approximately 150 basis points in the second half of 2014 due to 4 primary items: first, there was an aggressive planned ramp in new ECP branches; second, there was an unexpected opportunity to add more than 20 branches from Unipart when it was shut down. Collectively, this resulted in the addition of 44 new branches in the U.K. during 2014, a majority of which hit in the second half of the year. As you know, it takes several quarters for new branches to breakeven and a few years to reach maturity. Clearly, the acceleration and branch openings had a depressing impact on margins; third, as discussed during the last call, there was some price discounting in the marketplace as all the participants sought to replace Unipart as the preferred vendor at select clients when Unipart was shut down. We believe most of that is behind us.","And finally, as part of our 3-to-2 distribution strategy in the Benelux region, we had purchased 5 of our former distributor customers in the second half of 2014 and under U.S. GAAP, we were not able to record a profit on the inventory we had previously sold to these distributors, which depressed margins at Sator. While we will continue to buy other distributor customers as we work to complete the migration to a 2-step distribution model, the impact will likely be less than what was experienced in 2014. Those 4 items all had a negative impact on EBITDA margins in the second half of 2014, but we knew with time, the impact would begin to fade. Importantly, if given the same set of circumstances, we would absolutely make the same decisions to grow the business as they were in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders.","While EBITDA margins of our European segment in Q1 of 2015 were 9.5%, down 30 basis points from the 9.8% reported in Q1 of last year, the entire decline was due to foreign currency transaction losses, including the impact of foreign currency contracts used to hedge the purchase of inventory.","Importantly, EBITDA margins in Q1 of 2015 improved by 130 basis points from the 8.2% recorded in Q4 of last year. While some of the improvements is seasonal, we believe the residual impact of our decisions to aggressively grow the European business last year are beginning to abate.","Moving on to the key cash flow items for the company as a whole. Funds from operations during Q1 of 2015 totaled $180 million compared to $97 million in Q1 of last year. While we realized a $10 million increase in consolidated EBITDA, the real benefit came from an improvement in working capital since year end as we experienced a reduction in inventories and an increase in payables.","You may recall that we accelerated our purchases of aftermarket inventory in Q4 of 2014 in anticipation of some potential issues with the U.S. ports on the West Coast. So this decline was a temporary move and we fully anticipate inventories will grow as we proceed throughout the year.","During the quarter, we used $34 million of our cash for long-term investments. This included approximately $26 million of capital expenditures and $8 million of other investments, including acquisitions. The resulting net cash flow of $146 million was used to repay down approximately $80 million of our debt and to build our cash on hand.","At the end of Q1, we had approximately $1.7 billion of debt outstanding and $175 million of cash balances. The available capacity under our revolving credit agreement at the end of the quarter was just north of $1.2 billion which, when you add the cash balances, resulted in approximately $1.4 billion of available liquidity.","Total debt to the latest 12-month EBITDA was about 2.2x. And if you factor in the full year impact of EBITDA for the acquired businesses, the ratio fell to approximately 2.0x. So we believe we have more than ample ability to finance the continued growth of our business.","Finally, we are not changing the guidance provided in late February. We still expect organic revenue growth from Parts and Services will be in the range of 6.5% to 9%. Our net income and earnings per share guidance ranges are $420 million to $450 million, or $1.36 to $1.46 a share, respectively. And our guidance for capital expenditures is $150 million to $180 million with cash flow from operations of approximately $425 million.","I would like to highlight a few of the changes we have seen in the business since February and give you some indication as to why we have decided to leave the guidance unchanged, even after a solid first quarter.","The organic growth of 7.5% we reported for Parts and Services was in line with our prior guidance. While there will be periodic fluctuations due to weather or other events, we expect the fundamental drivers of that growth to continue. We believe that in North America the number of vehicles in our sweet spot will continue to grow and the trends of higher miles driven will help.","In Europe, we will continue to get the benefit of the new branch openings of the past few years and the growth of our collision and e-commerce businesses.","On our February earnings call, we discussed that we expected the negative impact from falling scrap prices to be $0.05 to $0.06 a share, primarily spread over the first 2 quarters with an emphasis in Q1. The impact of scrap prices in Q1 was only $0.02 a share. So basically, a $0.01 or $0.02 less than we had anticipated. Assuming current scrap prices hold, we now anticipate the full year impact to scrap will be $0.03 to $0.04 a share compared to the $0.05 to $0.06 we anticipated back in February. In other words, at current levels, we expect scrap to continue to hit earnings per share for $0.01 or $0.02 in the second quarter.","The other item we discussed last quarter was the impact of foreign exchange. The currencies continued to be volatile and, as noted, the impact on Q1 earnings per share was $0.02 a share. While the pound is currently trading in a range similar to when we issued our original guidance in February, the average exchange rate for the euro during April is down a bit further. So depending on where the currencies move during the remainder of the year, the initial estimate of FX having a $0.04 to $0.05 negative impact on the earnings per share might be light by a $0.01. So in total, we believe that the combined negative impact of scrap and FX, which was estimated in February at approximately $0.08 to $0.10 a share for the year is still a reasonable estimate.","In terms of putting some high-level characterization on the quarter's results, I would say that we believe we saw a strong performance in all of the lines of business.","North America continues to benefit from the trends we discussed earlier. As we anticipated on the last call, we saw the European segments starting to snap back from its soft performance in the second half of 2014. And while some of that is simply seasonal, we also benefited from better sales, margins and cost controls. And the integration plans in the Specialty business are on track.","The key message is that the underlying business -- the underlying business is progressing very much according to our plans and our balance sheet is in great shape to provide us the flexibility needed to continue to execute our strategy.","Before I turn the conversation back over to Rob, I just wanted to mention that over the past few weeks, I've received a few questions from the investment community as to why I decided to join LKQ. While major career changes are never simple, it really boiled down to 2 key items.","First, I believe the growth potential of LKQ is significant. How often do you have an opportunity to join a company that is a clear leader in its core categories and markets around the globe and still has organic growth rates that are 3x to 4x that of GDP? And there are still very significant potential to grow through acquisition. That affords an opportunity for me to help build the company into a substantially larger enterprise in the foreseeable future.","Second, I have known the company, and more importantly, the leadership team for a very, very long time. I understand the culture, core values and the absolute integrity of the organization, and that reduces the natural risk inherent in a move. Overall, it simply created an opportunity I couldn't pass up.","And I will now turn the discussion back to Rob for a wrap-up before Q&A.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, Nick. To summarize, we are quite pleased with our first quarter 2015 results. And as always, we could not do it without the dedication of our 29,000-plus employees. LKQ was founded in 1998 with a goal of forming the largest nationwide provider of recycled OEM automotive products. We achieved that objective yet have more runway to expand in that particular line of business across our existing North American network and into new geographies.","With the acquisition of Keystone Automotive Industries in 2007 and ECP in 2011, we diversified our company into different markets, products and geographies with the intent of expanding the use of all alternative parts globally, both in the professional mechanical and collision repair.","Though on the surface some segments and geographies look different, our strategies remain the same: identifying niche markets ripe for consolidation that offer combined synergies and network leverage; seek to acquire the #1 or #2 player with outstanding management in each segment; focus on sound return metrics and strive for the highest fill rates in our operating segments.","With this strategy, we continue to believe that LKQ is a unique company, not just because of the strength of our business model and operating segments, but also because of the consistent growth we are able to deliver both organically and from acquisitions.","Over the last 5 years, we have averaged over 8% organic growth for parts and services and nearly 19% from acquisitions. This performance was achieved in a low-growth environment for both our economy and for a lot of the companies in our industry. This strategy, coupled with the dynamics of increased miles driven, lower fuel prices and a strong sell rate, creates ongoing opportunities to grow our company across all of our operating segments and add long-term value for our stockholders.","Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First question just has to do with the start of the second quarter. If you could give us any perspective on the pace of revenue in the second quarter and any cost we should be aware of just so that we set the second quarter expectation correctly.","Robert L. Wagman","Craig, this is Rob. We've been talking to some of our bigger customers in North America. We didn't have a backlog coming out of Q1 that we had last year, but business has been steady, so we're pretty much where we thought we should be for April thus far. In Europe, same story there, pretty much where we expected to be. Revenue was looking to plan over in Europe as well.","John S. Quinn","And Craig, I think Nick noted that we're expecting some continuing impact from scrap because the cars we're selling today are ones we bought maybe earlier in Q1.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right, that helps. That helps, John. And then maybe my second question for you, John, since we may not get the opportunity to talk you as frequently on these calls. Just maybe give us a sense for your priorities in Europe. I know it's still early, so you're still forming your plan, but what are your priorities there? And how should we look to track that progress?","John S. Quinn","Sure. So I spent the better part of last month over there and I guess the way I view it is we have 2 really good businesses for the Netherlands and the U.K. But within each country, I think there are still a lot of work to do to finish some of the integration or the acquisitions we have, particularly in respect to the Netherlands. First thing is don't do any harm but make sure that we can continue to integrate those acquisitions within the countries. And there are some additional deals we need to do to continue to fill out the footprint there. In the Netherlands, we are at about 72 locations. We think we can probably end up somewhere in the 80 to 85 by the time we're done and we hope that platform builds over the end of the year. And then, when you move a little bit higher and you say, what else can we do? There's more integration to be done between the 2 countries. We did some preliminary integration on procurement in the last couple of years. I think we can do a lot more on that front. And that probably starts with getting the common catalog. There was a project underway to get a common catalog among the countries. And then using that knowledge to leverage the procurement across the group. And there are also some opportunities to probably integrate the procurement a little bit stronger between North America and Europe, particularly on some of the collision businesses where there's a heavy overlap in suppliers. And then, the third platform in the car integration is probably on the revenue opportunities, with particular [indiscernible] like e-commerce, where both countries have a nascent e-commerce business and we can lever the distribution network that we have to try to go through that. And then if you take those 1 step higher, there's obviously some other opportunities to do additional product lines, like, for example, we're now distributing paint or collision business in the Netherlands. So we look for additional opportunities to do those kinds of things, probably once we get the integration done. And then other geographies so that's [indiscernible] countries they currently exist, and then look for opportunities in other countries. So I think we'll be pretty busy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens.","John Russell Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Rob, would you go through a simple example? I mean, for years and years we've talked about this core competency of the acquisition procurement process. So with that algorithm now, can you just sort of walk us through what that would look like when a car comes into that -- to the handheld or whatever, what exactly changes as far as just the sort of the remedial process of looking at those cars to get that higher quality?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, really, nothing's changed, John, at all. The handheld device calculates demand, calculates the probability of sale. It's interesting, our average cost has come down from Q4 to Q1, up 4%. So we are buying a better car for less money. So we're very pleased with that trend. But in essence, whether you're buying a $300 car or a $2,000 car, the handheld does the exact same data lookup just basing on demand and probability of sale. And so nothing really has changed in that respect. In fact, it just allows our reps to get a higher dollar for that part as it's just a higher price part. We are buying, on average, about 1\/2 a year younger to 1 year younger vehicle this time now as opposed to last year. So really nothing has changed at all.","John S. Quinn","John, it's John Quinn speaking. I guess one thing you can think about is, if you got somewhere that is, for example, space constrained, the throughput whether you're dismantling a $2,000 car or a $3,000 car, it takes up the same amount of geography and roughly the same amount of labor and warehousing space. So the thinking is that if you can get a better car, you can improve your return on capital as well on those things. We don't have to buy additional land to grow the business. We've always said one way to grow this business is to buy additional cars. You provide 5% more cars, your revenues should go up about 5%. If you also buy a 5% better car, your revenue should go up 5% on basically the same footprint. And so part of this is just the strategy to try to move up market and particularly in a couple yards that are potentially space-constrained where we wouldn't -- want to avoid buying extra land.","John Russell Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Well, we're 40 minutes into the call, so I got to ask about State Farm, I guess.","Robert L. Wagman","Sure, glad to answer that. Update on the bumpers, Q1 was a 19.5% increase year-over-year. So still getting -- and that's up a strong comp, John. Other than that, no new news out of Bloomington, unfortunately. But we continue to really raise the number on the products they are writing in the aftermarket, in the bumpers. So we keep reminding them and we'll continue to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two questions, if I could. The first one has to do with your sequential operating expenses Q1 over Q4. I noticed that there was very nice leverage sequentially. I also noticed that there wasn't a whole lot of acquisitions this quarter, which gives us a little bit of a unique look into potentially what your organic leverage might look like with the legacy business. Can you help us, I'm not sure, Nick, if this for you or for John, but can you help us in terms of sequentially, how much of that leverage came from the absence of some one-off costs that may have occurred in 4Q? For example, some of the European branches, how much of that was seasonal? And how much of that might have been organic leverage, if you could? Specifically around S&W [ph] expenses, distribution expenses and SG&A expenses.","John S. Quinn","I think it's probably best to talk about the different segments because there's certainly a unique story in each one, right? So you're right, in North America we didn't -- we haven't done a lot of acquisitions in the quarter. There wasn't a lot of acquisition activity going, coming out of Q4, frankly, either in North America. So a lot of that was, I would say, sort of a seasonal leverage and you can just see that through the segment data. On the Specialty segment, that is a seasonal business both on -- with respect to that business and with respect to the European business. I'd just remind people that Q4 tends to be a bit softer in those 2 businesses. Historically, if you look at the company, Q1 was our strongest and Q4 was our second strongest when we were basically a collision-focused business. But as we've been diversifying into more into some of these hard parts [ph] Specialty products, Q1 tends to be the strongest quarter. And on those 2 segments, Q4 is a lot lighter. So you didn't see -- on the Specialty segment, we got the benefit of some of the integration of Stag Parkway. Stag Parkway didn't contribute very much at all in Q4 last year, probably because of the seasonal thing and partly because we haven't really executed on some of the synergies, which I think Nick spoke to the fact that they did a good job getting a lot of those synergies captured already. So some of that is, you're right, integration improvement coming through. And then on the European business, I don't have any specifics for you, Sam, but we did talk about the fact that we were carrying some additional cost associated with the branch openings. There's also a little bit of a profit deferral associated with those acquisitions that we do in the Netherlands. So we did see operating leverage with respect to the businesses there, for sure. And again, some of that's the seasonality and some of it is just better -- getting the revenue, I would say, from those acquisitions and being able to recognize more of the profit with respect to the Sator acquisition.","Dominick P. Zarcone","And Sam, this is Nick. As Rob indicated, and this particularly goes to distribution cost, we did gain a little bit of benefit on fuel, as fuel prices came down pretty substantially from Q4 and that helped a bit. We helped thousands of trucks that travel millions of miles across the roads and highways around the globe and we consume a fair amount of fuel. So that helped a little bit.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two more quick questions, if I could, and I think you mentioned this in the prepared remarks and I missed it I apologize. What was the impacts specifically of the Sator move to 2-step on overall gross margins? And I have 1 final quick follow-up as well.","John S. Quinn","On a year-over-year basis?","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Sure.","Robert L. Wagman","Let's take a look at that while you go on and ask your second question.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Sure, sure. The last question, I noticed a minority interest was up pretty nicely on a percentage basis, which suggests that your Australian JV is doing quite well. Anything there that is learnings or something translatable that you're seeing down there, Rob, that you might be able to transfer over to your European operations as you try and grow that alternative business?","Robert L. Wagman","Well, one thing that is nice, Sam, is that we're obviously working directly with the insurance company, so that owns a large body shop chain down there. So we're taking the parts that we're procuring directly from them and putting them right into their repair stream. So yes, we think there could be actually some move over. As you know, we entered the Swedish market last quarter and we're doing something very similar in the Swedish market there actually by procuring directly from the insurance company. So we do think there is something to be done there. The reason why we don't think it's really applicable here in the U.S. because the country is so large. I mean, Australia is a unique market in that 90% of the population live in 4 cities and we have [indiscernible] in 3 of those 4 cities. Perth, on the western side of the country, we haven't focus on yet. But yes, we do think there is something we could take from the U.S. or from the Australian market into the European market, which we're kind of doing in Sweden right now.","John S. Quinn","And Sam, with respect to the impact of the acquisitions, we did see a little bit of improvement in the margin in the Netherlands, but because the Netherlands is relatively small compared to the total company, it wasn't really enough to drive the overall company margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I appreciate all that color. A couple of things. One, just focusing on kind of the North American organic growth rate. Obviously, we were up against a tough comp. You probably had some weather disruption in certain areas in February with cities shutting down, which ends up being a net negative for you guys. And my gut tells me that there's obviously with buying a few -- fewer cars, obviously that's probably impacted the portion of the self-service that goes into the parts and service number for North America. How should we think about that kind of going forward? Historically, you've always given a range of about 5% to 7% organic growth for North America. We have some favorable trends going on with miles driven and more parts for repair, and like you say, a little bit better quality part. How should we think about the growth rate there for kind of the next couple of quarters or the remainder of the year?","Robert L. Wagman","Nate, we get a report from CCC, the leading estimating company here in the United States. We just had a sit down with them this week. It's interesting, they showed stats by states. And New England, as you rightly mentioned, was shut down for those 3 blizzards they had. So it was very slow in New England. It was pretty interesting from Pennsylvania West to the Minnesota-Iowa market, claims were actually down. So they -- we had very little snow in Chicago as you know. So we don't have a backlog coming out of Q1. However, as you mentioned, we're up against a tough comp. We do feel good because of those trends you're talking about, the newer car part, definitely is working in our favor. One thing you didn't mention was the amount of certified parts. Certified parts increased 18% year-over-year, which is good for obviously for the aftermarket. Our backlog is very healthy. Very strong backlog at all of our facilities. Miles driven are increasing. Gas prices, although they've come up a little bit, are still substantially down year-over-year. And the man time [ph] is finally stable. So yes, we feel good about the next couple of quarters once that all fleshes out. And certainly, when these new cars, these 16 million and 17 million SAAR rates start getting 2 and 3 years out, we feel pretty good that there's going to be a really healthy amount of cars coming to the sweet spot. So pretty bullish on the North American growth and I feel confident that the 5 to 7 is still going to hold.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And John, kind of a question along the other one in terms of all the opportunities over in Europe. And it sounds like, just based on some of the cost pressures that we had temporarily in the fourth quarter and some of things that happened, as those go away, I think it sounds like that, that margin improvement over there is fairly sustainable and probably even has upside as you implement some of those 4 things that you spoke about. Do you have any rough time line on how long you think it will take to get to each of those 4 opportunities or any initial viewpoint on how fast that kind of moves in terms of making that integration kind of seeing at 100% versus where we might be at, give or take, I don't know, 70% today?","John S. Quinn","Yes. We don't have a good sense here. We just kicked off the project on sort of getting the common catalog. And I think the procurement though, we're very quick to bringing that team together, and so that will be relatively quick. I do think over time, what we'd like to get is the sustainable double-digit EBITDA margins over there. I'd be a bit like an economist to give you number but not a date, but I don't think it's years and but it's probably some time in 2016, 2017 before we get there on a sustainable basis.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick final question regarding the gross margin improvement in North America, which kind of helped by not buying as many cars because of the scrap impact. Should that be -- I mean, I know that there's a net-net negative impact in the second quarter, but should we continue to see kind of those margins trend up temporarily as we kind of do some of these better pricing initiatives, et cetera? Or it will be impacted buying the better quality parts, eventually kind of offset that and maybe it's kind of a neutral going forward kind of look?","Dominick P. Zarcone","Nate, this is Nick. The gross margins in the first quarter on a comparative basis to last year were actually down, just that and that really reflected the impact of the scrap and the pressure it weighed on with the -- the positive impact of increased prices on the aftermarket not being able to fully cover the impact of scrap. We do not see any major shifts in our margin structure in North America. Obviously, that assumes that scrap prices stay about where they are and it assumes that we still get the pull-through purchasing the higher-quality car that Rob and John talked about a little bit earlier in the call, because that gives us the ability to get more parts dollars off those vehicles. But we are not anticipating any major shifts in the margin structure.","Robert L. Wagman","I was just going to add to what Nick said about scrap. Scrap last week was roughly about $135 a ton, so it at least stabilized from where it was in February. But just to put in perspective, it's 37% down year-over-year and 25% sequentially. So scrap will be a little bit of a headwind, still.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","But just then kind of put that into conclusion at least going sequentially, we should expect, given some of the puts and the takes, to kind of balance out and give or take, pretty flat gross margins for the rest of the year, again, assuming scrap stays where it's at?","John S. Quinn","Yes, there's a little bit of seasonality on the gross margin in the Specialty business.","Robert L. Wagman","In Q4.","Dominick P. Zarcone","Right.","John S. Quinn","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Rob, you mentioned that you're paying about 4% less for car. Is that really a function of the fact that scrap has come down? Is that what is making the car purchases a little bit better for you?","Robert L. Wagman","I think that's certainly a portion of it, Gary. I also think that there's such a large export that the auctions export, and I think that the dollar has worked in our favor. So I think that may also be impacting it. So I think it's a combination of the strong dollar and scrap coming down.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of -- I just want to clear something up with myself, in terms of Sator, when you're going from a 3- to a 2-step distribution model, is the intent to have all of Sator's business go to that 3- to 2-step model?","John S. Quinn","No. It'll continue to have 3-step distribution models. Keep in mind, we're only talking about the Netherlands when we're talking about converting this right now. The Belgian operation is still [indistinguishable] and so is France.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so it's only the Netherlands, okay.","John S. Quinn","Well, even within the Netherlands we'll continue to have partners where -- that are distributing as well.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And I know you had mentioned something about collision parts on the continent, and I know you've purchased something, I think, in Sweden or something like that?","John S. Quinn","Correct.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","But in terms of the bigger part of the continent, France, Germany, all that, when do you think you'll start getting some of that collision parts business out there?","John S. Quinn","Again, if you -- let me backup. First of all, France has unusual rules that it's against the law to put an aftermarket product on a French-made car. Until that law gets changed, probably not be huge business there, although people do distribute through companies like ourselves OE parts. The OEs use non-dealers to distribute parts there. So there is an opportunity on that front. We generally need the last mile, right? We need to be able to get the parts to the customer. At the moment, we don't have the network to do that anywhere in a particular country, as you described, Germany, France, even the Netherlands, we still not have the product -- the facility built out and the infrastructure built out. So I think the initial focus really is just to get the Netherlands integrations. And if we can find an acquisition or a couple of smaller companies that distribute aftermarket product and there's some salvage companies, if we could find one of those that was attractive and want to sell at a reasonable price, then we would probably buy that and use that as a footprint. Most of our distribution right now is to the mechanical repair shop on the continent. We have a very little interaction with collision body shops. Whereas in the U.K., we've developed very strong relationships with all of the body shops, particularly through our paint acquisitions there. So I guess what I'm telling you, Gary, is it's probably not going to be this year, but it's not going to be multiple years either.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Thanks for clearing that up. And then just lastly, on the tax rate, John. I think the last call, you had said that the tax rate would be high in the first couple of quarters, then transition down to about 34% as you start getting a better balance of profits coming from lower tax rate jurisdictions is that about where you thinking right now that by the third and fourth quarter, we would be at a 34% tax rate?","John S. Quinn","No. Generally we try to do is estimate the full year tax rate and then adjust for any discrete items. So there's about a $700,000 discrete item that was -- if you look at the year-over-year increase on the tax rate, about 1\/2 of that was a discrete item, that will go away in Q2. And we would anticipate using that same rate, for the rest of the year. So the rate going forward, to use a little bit over 35% is probably about right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers [ph] with Great Lakes Review [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Nice to see the continued double-digit organic growth and the 12 months and older ECP branches, and I was wondering how sustainable you think that is?","John S. Quinn","It takes almost 4 years for branch -- 3 to 4 years for branch to reach full maturity. So if you look at the cadence of the branches that we've opened the last couple of years -- branches that were opened, for example, in 2013 are still maturing and they're still growing. So some of that growth what you're seeing is maturing on the branches, and then also, the much older branches continue to take market share. So yes, I don't want to get into specifics and giving sort of multi-year guidance here, but we do believe we have a number of years of additional growth just as those branches, as Nick mentioned the 40-odd branches we opened last year, are going to continue to mature over the next couple of years.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then looking at the acquisitions that you made, the 2 distributors and the Nebraska business, how much in total revenue do you expect that to contribute on an annual basis?","John S. Quinn","It's less than $5 million, it's very small.","Unknown Analyst","Alright. And finally the online purchasing through CCC, about what amount in revenue does that make up currently?","Robert L. Wagman","We've been tracking it as a percentage of increase because it's still off of a small base. But revenue, Jason, was up 75% year-over-year, and purchase orders were up 70% year-over-year. It's roughly annualizing at about $22 million a year right now.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we have exceeded our allotted time for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning. We look forward to speaking to you in July, we report our second quarter 2015 results. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour.","We are pleased to share both the results of our most recent quarter and the progress made on the various initiatives we have implemented since our previous call. I will provide some high-level comments, and then Varun will dig into the segments and related financial details before I come back to discuss our updated 2018 guidance and make a few closing remarks.","Taken as a whole, we had a very solid third quarter, and today's discussion will focus on four key things: our continued pursuit of highly profitable revenue growth, solid progress on our margin improvement plans, excellent cash conversion, and adding a tool to optimize our capital allocation strategy.","In reviewing our results, you will know we had excellent organic growth in global parts and services revenue and that our margins in Europe and Specialty improved compared to the third quarter of last year. While North American gross margins on a reported basis were down a bit on a year-over-year basis, they were up when removing the self-service business, which took the brunt of the negative impact of falling metals pricing during the quarter. Varun will cover this specific segment margin details shortly.","Solid profits and effective working capital management led to one of the highest levels of quarterly operating cash flow in the 20-year history of the company. And with respect to capital allocation, as hopefully you all read from our press release issued this morning, I am pleased to announce that our board of directors has authorized a $500 million stock repurchase program. As we stated in the release, our main priorities are to continue to both invest in the growth of our global business and de-lever the balance sheet. That said, our strong capital position and healthy cash flows afford us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers while simultaneously utilizing our share repurchase program to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy.","Now on to the quarter. As noted on slide 4, consolidated revenue for the quarter was a record-high $3.12 billion, reflecting a 26.6% increase, as compared to the $2.47 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2017. For the third quarter of 2018, parts and services total revenue growth was approximately 27% with organic growth of more than 4% and acquisition-related growth of approximately 23%. As mentioned over the past several quarters, very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth anywhere close to this level.","Net income attributable to LKQ stockholders for the third quarter of 2018 was $134 million, up 9.6% year-over-year. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to LKQ stockholders was $177 million, an increase of 26.9% as compared to the $140 million for the same period of 2017.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the third quarter of 2018 was $0.42, as compared to $0.39 for the same period of last year, an increase of 7.7%. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders was a record third quarter high of $0.56 a share, a 24.4% increase, as compared to the $0.45 recorded for the same period of 2017.","Let's turn to some of the segment highlights. As you will note from slide 6, total parts and services revenue growth for our North American segment grew 5.5% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter of last year, with organic revenue growth for parts and services during the quarter of 5.2%, which was in line with our expectations. As noted the past few quarters, the new battery distribution agreement with FCA contributed about 150 basis points to the organic growth, so it comes with a lower margin structure as we essentially just get a service fee.","All said, we continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC Information Services, collision and liability-related auto claims on a national basis were up only 0.3% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to last year and up only 0.4% on a year-to-date basis. As was the case in the first half of the year, there continues to be meaningful variances in growth rates across the geographic regions of North America, with key markets such as New York, California, Pennsylvania, Florida and Michigan each down low to mid-single digits. We believe the significant outperformance in our growth relative to the CCC data for repairable claims is due to the continued increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot, that being model years 3 to 10 years old, and continued market share gains.","Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q3 was achieved while miles driven in the United States were up just 1.2% on a national basis in August. Although like the claims data, there were significant regional differences.","The organic growth for aftermarket parts continued to outpace that of salvage parts, as the repair shops continue to focus on improving cycle times given the increased volume of work they were processing. Importantly, we continue to see increases in our total aftermarket collision SKU offerings, as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 5.7% and 11.2%, respectively, in Q3.","Our North American team made solid progress with their recovery efforts despite facing the ongoing cost pressures primarily from wage, fuel and freight inflation. These efforts include being disciplined in terms of pricing and discounts and driving continued improvements with our telematics and road map platforms.","These are just a sample of the initiatives in play. We believe there are more margin improvement opportunities, and we are not done. I'm very proud of our North American team and how diligently and aggressively they are working to offset these inflationary pressures, which we anticipate will be with us for the foreseeable future.","Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 53.7%, primarily driven by the acquisition of STAHLGRUBER. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 2%, reflecting a pullback from the second quarter levels. While we fully anticipated organic revenue growth in Europe to decline from the very robust Q2 levels, our performance in the third quarter was a bit below our expectations.","The slightly lower organic growth is reflective of several factors. First, there was soft economic growth in a few markets experiencing some level of political instability, including Italy, which elected a new government earlier this year and is dealing with major budgetary issues; and the UK, which continues to muddle through the Brexit saga. Second, there was unseasonably warm weather throughout most of Europe during the quarter. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we did not submit to price-cutting practices from our competitors and stayed very focused on our efforts to maintain our margins through profitable and balanced revenue growth.","That said, there were several positive longer-term developments during the quarter. For example, in the UK, our depth of inventory, national footprint and service levels owing to the T2 investment have enabled us to continue winning national account business, evidenced by several recent wins with the likes of Halfords Autocentres, The CarShop, Formula One and the British Telecom Fleet. The new contracts will have little impact on our 2018 results, and the primary benefits are expected next year.","With respect to Andrew Page, on August 31, we finalized the sale of the Andrew Page branches the antitrust authorities required us to divest. We continue to integrate and rationalize the remaining 77 branches, and I am happy to report that the entire Andrew Page branch network is now being replenished out of the T2 distribution facility. Additionally, Andrew Page's former national distribution center was vacated and returned to the landlord in July on schedule. The recently acquired STAHLGRUBER acquisition is performing consistent with our expectations, and we are very pleased to have it as part of LKQ Europe. Finally, during the third quarter, we opened a total of seven new branches in Eastern Europe.","Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During Q3, Specialty reported total revenue growth of 18%, including organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8% and acquisition growth of more than 10%. The higher-than-anticipated organic growth is a result of increased RV parts demand, positive U.S. economic conditions, including low employment, strong consumer spending, and the continued favorable trend in light truck and SUV sales.","Additionally, as you may recall from our May 31 Investor Day, Bill Rogers, the President of our Specialty segment, outlined some of the key initiatives and strategy for his team, which included increasing customer penetration and expanding our exclusive brands offering. During the quarter, the Specialty team delivered on its promise by entering into exclusive distribution agreements with Yakima Products for automotive and RV market distribution of their racking products, and GRID Off-Road, a leading designer and manufacturer of specialty off-road wheels and accessories.","These agreements are a testament to the power of our Specialty distribution and logistics network, the depth of our customer base, and the effectiveness of our industry leading marketing programs, which combined allow partners such as Yakima and GRID to focus on what they do best: design, innovation and manufacturing.","Lastly on Specialty, I'm pleased to announce that during the quarter, we opened up our new 450,000-square-foot distribution center in Eastvale, California. This warehouse further demonstrates our commitment to continuously enhance the superior service experience for our customers, support the operating efficiencies of our suppliers, and create a higher level of safety measures for our team.","Moving on to corporate development. In addition to finalizing the divestiture of the Andrew Page branches, during the third quarter, we acquired three wholesale businesses in Europe for a total net consideration of approximately $79 million. We continue to work on both the integration of STAHLGRUBER and the benefits of scale across our entire European footprint.","Lastly, on August 6, the company announced the appointment of Meg Divitto, John Mendel and Jody Miller to our board of directors. As our Chairman Joe Holston stated in the announcement, these three new directors complement and enhance our board with skills and experiences in such areas as automotive technology, government affairs and finance. We are quite confident they will provide valuable perspectives as we continue to execute our strategy.","And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run through the details of the segment results.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter and cover our current liquidity position before turning it back to Nick for an update on full-year guidance.","Overall, we are pleased with the results of the third quarter, especially as each segment delivered some positive notes. North America generated solid organic revenue growth and narrowed the year-over-year gap in segment EBITDA margin relative to the past few quarters. Europe delivered a 50-basis-point year-over-year and a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in segment EBITDA margins. And Specialty had excellent revenue growth along with a 40-basis-point year-over-year expansion in segment EBITDA margins.","I'll cover these results and the underlying causes in greater detail in a few minutes, though needless to say that while we continue to make positive progress in each of our businesses, we also acknowledge that we still have further work to do related to our initiatives to offset the ongoing cost pressures and improve profitability.","Regarding year-over-year comparability, we completed the STAHLGRUBER acquisition in May 2018, so the third quarter represents our first full quarter with the STAHLGRUBER operation. I will highlight the impact of STAHLGRUBER on the variances as relevant.","As noted on slide 13 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was down 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.3% due primarily to a 20-basis-point reduction in the North America segment and a negative mix impact related to Europe off a further 20 basis points. With our STAHLGRUBER acquisition, the lower gross margin European segment makes up for a larger percentage of the consolidated result and has a dilutive effect on the consolidated margin.","Segment EBITDA totaled $326 million for the third quarter, reflecting a $59 million or a 22% increase over the comparable quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was down 30 basis points to 10.5% versus the prior year.","Our operating expenses were flat year-over-year with increases in freight and vehicle expenses offset by leverage in personnel costs and a favorable mix effect from the STAHLGRUBER acquisition. During the third quarter, restructuring and acquisition-related costs increased by $2 million compared to the prior year, and depreciation and amortization expense grew by $20 million largely due to the STAHLGRUBER transaction. With that, operating income for the third quarter of 2018 increased by about $35 million or roughly 18% when compared to the same period in 2017.","Interest expense was up $16 million or 62% year-over-year due to higher average debt balances and slightly higher interest rates primarily related to the STAHLGRUBER financing. Pre-tax income during the third quarter of 2018 was $201 million, up $23 million or up 13% compared to the prior year.","Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 22.9% for the quarter. We updated our estimate of the annual effective tax rate during the third quarter to 27.2%, up 20 basis points from our previous estimate in the second quarter. The higher rate is driven mostly by a change in the geographic distribution of earnings.","We had various discrete items in the quarter, including a favorable adjustment for a $10 million true-up to reduce our provisional estimate of the transition tax related to repatriating cumulative foreign earnings. We have excluded this favorable discrete item in our calculation of adjusted EPS.","In the equity earnings line, which is where we report our share of the results of Mekonomen, we recorded a $20 million loss in the quarter. This loss is attributable to a $23 million noncash impairment charge on our Mekonomen investment, which I noted as a possibility during the second quarter earnings call.","Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the third quarter was $0.42, up $0.03 relative to the comparable quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, acquisition and divestiture-related gains and losses, impairment charges, adjustments to the provisional demands related to the U.S. tax reform and the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation was $0.56, reflecting a 24% improvement.","Moving to the segments with North America on slide 16, you will note that gross margins during the third quarter were 43.2%, down 40 basis points over the 43.6% reported a year ago. Our self-service operation's growth is 60 basis points decline, primarily resulting from lower revenue per car due to declining scrap steel prices. Without the self-service impact into lower scrap prices, gross margin in North America was up on a year-over-year basis.","Additionally, our gross margin in the wholesale North America operations contributed a 40-basis-point improvement relative to the third quarter of 2017, owing to active margin management and pricing refinements. I'm very encouraged that our wholesale North America operations reported sequential improvement in gross margin percentage of 70 basis points. This result is the continuation of efforts that the North America management team initiated during the second quarter. I'm also encouraged that we were able to generate sequential gross margin improvement while producing solid organic revenue growth. As Nick mentioned, we will continue to pursue profitable revenue growth, which may in the short term put pressure on sales volumes. Make no mistake, this will require discipline to stick to the objective.","Apart from the potential for some short-term disruption, we do believe that our customers will recognize the advantages of partnering with LKQ, namely our broad product offering, strong customer service and nationwide distribution capabilities will certainly swing things in our favor.","Shifting to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we saw an increase of 50 basis points compared to last year and 140 basis points sequentially, which we traditionally see going from the second quarter to the third quarter due to seasonal revenue patterns. Consistent with the first half of the year, we're still facing headwinds related to freight, vehicle and fuel costs like many other distributors, and these costs drove a 50-basis-point increase over the prior year. We're actively working to address these headwinds as well as wage inflation and rising benefit costs to the pricing initiatives that I previously noted and cost controls throughout the organization.","In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the third quarter of 2018 was $154 million, up 1% compared to the prior year, and as a percentage of revenue down 70 basis points from the prior-year quarter.","Looking at slide 18, scrap prices were up 4% over the comparable quarter from a year ago but down relative to Q2 of 2018 by 16%. As we previously mentioned, the impact from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time. The downward trend in Q3 had a negative effect of approximately $7 million on segment EBITDA or a little under $0.02 on adjusted diluted EPS. Without the negative impact from scrap prices, our segment EBITDA margin for North America would have been roughly flat to the third quarter of 2017.","Sequential EBITDA margin is down 90 basis points for North America, which reflects a seasonal pattern in the business. You may recall in 2017, the prior year, the segment EBITDA percentage dropped by 150 basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. So while we are narrowing the year-over-year gap in margin and continue to make progress on the initiatives launched earlier in the year, we've clearly got further room for improvement and the team continues to push hard.","Moving on to our European segment on slide 19. Gross margin in Europe was 36.6% in Q3, a 20-basis-point increase over the comparable period of 2017. In addition, our Sator business in the Benelux region continued to show margin expansion, contributing a 40-basis-point improvement to the segment, with specific strength in private label sales and the ongoing move from a three-step to a two-step model in that market. Our centralized procurement yielded a 30-basis-point improvement from supplier rebate programs and STAHLGRUBER had a 30-basis-point favorable impact on gross margin percentage as well.","As we've discussed in prior quarters, our UK operations were working through incremental costs associated with T2 in the third quarter, and these costs are mostly past us as we got into the fourth quarter. The T2 costs combined with higher inventory write-offs drove a 40-basis-point reduction in gross margin. And the Central and Eastern European mix cost us a further 30 basis points.","With respect to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we experienced a 40-basis-point decrease on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago. This improvement was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs in the UK and a favorable mix impact from STAHLGRUBER. STAHLGRUBER's results were consistent with the previously disclosed projected impact for the remainder of the year. European segment EBITDA totaled $129 million, a 63% increase over the prior year.","As shown on slide 21, relative to the third quarter of 2017, the pound sterling and the euro both weakened by approximately 100 basis points against the U.S. dollar. So, there was a not very material effect from the translation in the third quarter","Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 8.8% for the third quarter of 2018, up 50 basis points from the same period a year ago. We are pleased with the year-over-year and sequential growth in margins, and the team remains committed to the previously stated objective to deliver double-digit segment EBITDA margins by the end of the three-year period that started in January 2018.","Related to Europe, I'd also like to discuss our equity interest in Mekonomen, a leading car parts and service chain in the Nordic region. We noted on the Q2 call that Mekonomen's share price had declined since we acquired our shares in 2016, which could necessitate an impairment charge if the share price didn't show sufficient improvement. Well, this was indeed the case, and in the third quarter, we recorded a $23 million noncash impairment charge.","Further on Mekonomen, in connection with its previously announced acquisition in Denmark and Poland, we elected to participate in a rights offering for additional Mekonomen shares. Earlier this month, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million additional shares for roughly $48 million to maintain our 26.5% ownership interest in the company. We continue to believe Mekonomen is a strong, well-run business, and we are very optimistic about its prospects going forward. Please do note that both the Mekonomen impairment and a non-operating gain related to the rights offering have been excluded from our calculation of adjusted diluted EPS.","Turning to our Specialty segment on slide 22, the business continues to deliver solid results. The One (00:29:31) business is performing well and, as previously disclosed, has a higher margin profile than the base Specialty segment. One (00:29:38) contributed 70 basis points to the growth in the gross margin percentage. The base Specialty business, i.e., without One, (00:29:47) generated an 8% organic revenue growth rate in the quarter, which was a nice rebound from the lower rate that we experienced in the first half. And we are encouraged that they were able to do so while maintaining gross margin expansion. The increase was partially offset by higher inventory write-offs representing 50 basis points related to damage and defective parts identified during warehouse expansion projects.","Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were 30 basis points higher relative to the prior year, and the primary variances related essentially to similar stories what you'd heard before higher vehicle and fuel expenses. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $43 million, up 22% from the third quarter of 2017, and as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 40 basis points to 11%.","Let's move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. As presented on slide 24, you will note that our cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2018 was $521 million, which is about $72 million or 16% percent higher than through the comparable period a year ago. As Nick mentioned earlier, operating cash flows for the quarter were strong at $192 million due to solid profitability, improved receivables collections and moderate inventory growth.","We've adjusted our full-year guidance for operating cash flows from operations to $610 million to $660 million. You may be asking why we would take our cash flow from operations guidance down by $50 million after such a good quarter for cash flow conversion. Well, first, we are lowering our earnings guidance by approximately $20 million that will translate into lower cash flows.","Second, we made a decision to unwind a large receivables factoring program in our STAHLGRUBER business, as we had a significantly more cost-effective financing available than this legacy arrangement. However, unwinding the program will slow receivables collections in the quarter, and we expect an outflow for these STAHLGRUBER receivables in the fourth quarter, which should not reoccur in future periods. Other than these two factors, we expect to continue on pace with our prior guidance.","As always, we will continue to be nimble in reacting to changing market conditions. For example, while we currently have not incorporated any Brexit-associated impact, there is a chance we will need to begin to increase our inventories in the UK during the fourth quarter to protect our business from potential supply chain disruptions resulting from a lack of a robust trade agreement between the UK and the EU.","As I previously mentioned, cash conversion is a key area of opportunity and focus for us, so let me give you a little insight on what we've been doing to improve cash flow conversion. First, working capital management has become a prominent component of our monthly business reviews with segment management. We covered trends in key statistics such as past due receivable, inventory turns and days payables outstanding, and we actively discuss the action items that our field management is taking to improve these metrics.","Second, we are going to hold ourselves accountable for managing working capital by including free cash flow and other working capital measures in the performance targets for our 2019 incentive programs. While I am confident that we have the team's attention on working capital today, adding the compensation element will heighten that focus. And also while I appreciate that organizational change does not happen overnight, we've been laying the groundwork in the background, and I'm confident that we are setting the business for a strong year of free cash flow generation in 2019.","Moving on to CapEx, CapEx for the quarter was $56 million and $172 million for the year-to-date period. In our guidance, we have decreased our capital spending plan a bit to a range of $240 million to $260 million. In the third quarter, we continue to make progress on our outstanding debt by paying down a further $74 million, which we funded from cash flows from operations. In the first nine months of the current year, we've now paid down $199 million on our credit facility borrowings.","Moving on to slide 25, as of September 30, we had approximately $4.4 billion of total debt outstanding and $341 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $4.1 billion or 3 times last 12 months' EBITDA, down from 3.1 times as of the end of the second quarter.","On slide 26, we've added the key return metrics that we track, though please note that we are excluding the impact of STAHLGRUBER in the calculations to eliminate the short-term movement caused by large investments. We will add STAHLGRUBER into the calculations once we've annualized the transaction.","And then, finally, on the stock repurchase program that Nick mentioned earlier, we believe we can finance the repurchases primarily through free cash flow generation with a measured approach towards future acquisitions, and our ongoing efforts to improve profitability and working capital management, we expect to generate sufficient cash flows to invest in the growth of the business, manage our leverage and return excess capital to our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick to cover the updated revenue and earnings guidance.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Varun, for that detailed overview.","Considering the results achieved in the third quarter and a detailed review by our operating units with respect to their projected fourth quarter results, we have adjusted our annual guidance on a few of the key financial metrics.","With our continued focus on highly profitable revenue, we anticipate our global organic revenue growth from parts and services will likely come down a bit in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, given we are sitting at 5.1% through September, we have tightened the top end of the full-year guidance by 50 basis points and now have a full range of 4.5% to 5% for organic revenue growth.","In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we have moved the range to $2.19 on the low end to $2.25 on the high end with a midpoint of $2.22 a share. This reflects both the $0.56 reported for the third quarter and the revised field forecast for the fourth quarter, which historically has always been the softest quarter of the year, reflecting the natural seasonality of our businesses. Importantly, the impact of lower FX rates and metals prices collectively account for approximately $0.04 of the reduction relative to our prior guidance.","Those EPS adjustments yield a range for adjusted net income of $690 million to $710 million. As Varun mentioned, we have revised the guidance for cash flow from operations to $610 million to $660 million, largely reflecting the change in earnings and the onetime increase in receivables related to the termination of a special factoring program at STAHLGRUBER. We believe the effective tax rate will be approximately 27.2%, and the guidance assumes current levels as it relates to FX rates and no further deterioration in scrap metals pricing.","In closing, I am very proud of the hard work and dedication of our more than 49,000 employees as they have delivered for the company, our stockholders and, most importantly, our customers during the quarter. I am equally proud of our team's efforts to effectively address the headwinds encountered this year. We have made further progress, and while we are not done, I am confident in our team's ability to effectively implement their respective plans.","Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Varun, I wanted to ask about the STAHLGRUBER factoring program that you ended. I think a lot of shareholders are interested in these factoring programs as a way to promote better capital efficiency. So, clearly, you've explored that but concluded that you have a more cost-effective way of pursuing it. Shed a little more light on that because I think a lot of shareholders would like to see more factoring, not less, but I'm sure you've looked at it and would love some detail.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yes, absolutely, Craig, and listen, good morning and thank you for calling in this early in the day. I know it's a busy day for all of you, and so really, really appreciate joining our call this morning.","Yeah, so with regards to factoring programs in general, we have been working in the background. And while we're not ready to disclose anything at this point of time, we do believe there is a certain level of benefit that could accrue from a balance sheet management perspective.","With regards to the STAHLGRUBER program more specifically, it's essentially a case of the cost of funding that they've been paying for their factoring program versus what we can provide on an ongoing basis. But part of it involves us essentially terminating that program, which will take place in the current quarter, i.e. the fourth quarter, and then we will replace it with an alternative program in any case. But partially, the factor that we will trip (00:40:55) into the receivables collection in the current quarter, which will lead to a slower collection effort in the current quarter.","So, again back to the program itself, we believe there are certain benefits, but not at the levels of funding that STAHLGRUBER was paying. We believe there are synergies associated with the lower cost of capital that we will be deploying.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Nick, Varun, for the questions. Around just (00:41:35) the $0.02 to $0.04 when you think about it operationally because like, fair enough, $0.04 is FX and scrap, help us understand what you control to be able to get that back in the future and between discounts, pricing, like are you seeing any OE (00:41:53) pricing? Can you help us with the plans that help get that back in the future?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Michael, and thanks for the question. So the adjustment to the guidance, $0.07 in total, if you will, $0.04 of that is basically scrap. You saw $0.02 of it hit in the third quarter, the next $0.02 will hit in the fourth quarter. Scrap has fallen from almost $200 a ton at the end of last quarter. Today, it's sitting in the high $150s, if you will, so even well below the third quarter average. So there's very little we can do to offset the impact of scrap metal pricing.","The other $0.03 is a combination of things. Some of it has to do with the fact that we are focusing on high margin revenue growth. Every dollar of revenue is not worth the same. And the reality is in an effort to improve our margins, we're more than happy to let some of that incremental revenue go by the wayside if it's at low margins, if you will. Some of it has to do with rising benefit cost. We had a significant uptick in our healthcare expense in the third quarter in North America, if you will. We think that's going to leak into the fourth quarter as well. And then we took some legal reserves and expenses.","The focus is and the key, I think, is in the third quarter, as both Varun and I mentioned, gross margins in North America. If you take out the impact of the self-serve business, which is where most of the impact of scrap is, gross margins were up. So we are making progress and climbing back on some of those inflationary operating expenses that have been a cause of concern earlier in the year. So we are making good progress. We think in the fourth quarter, actually, we're going to continue to make progress and the EBITDA margin gap on a year-over-year basis is going to shrink further, if you will. So the programs we have in place, we think, are working. It's just it's going to take a little time.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Michael, just one more piece to kind of reiterate what Nick mentioned in case that was kind of lost on everyone calling in. The previous guidance that we gave at the end of July, which had a midpoint of $2.29, that did not include any FX or, for that matter, scrap declines. That's what we've always done and that's how we've always given guidance.","And so really if you kind of think of the $2.29 midpoint to call it the now $2.22 midpoint or the $0.07 drop, $0.04 of that $0.07 is essentially related to scrap, $0.02 of which was realized in the third quarter, and based on what we're seeing scrap prices currently, in the current quarter a further $0.02. So that's how you should be thinking about. And then, again, the remaining $0.03 essentially is exactly how Nick mentioned, we're focusing on margin accretive profitable business coming through and so we will keep focusing on that and margin management and pricing refinements to offset the operational macroeconomic headwinds that are buffeting our industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ben.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","This is actually Daniel (00:45:29) on for Ben, but thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to start actually on CapEx. As you guys work through improving margins in the coming years, Nick, I think you mentioned a few times that large-scale M&A probably slows down from here. What's the CapEx trajectory would look like from here? Should there be a continued ramp in CapEx in the coming years? Know (00:45:48) this year was more of a catch-up, but just wondering what that outlook looks like?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So we obviously brought down our CapEx estimate for the year as a whole, and some of that has to do with where we are this year and what people around the globe have spent, if you will. Again, this was a pretty big uptick in capital in 2018 relative to the past years. Next year, obviously, we're going to have STAHLGRUBER in the mix for the entire year, so that will be an incremental amount. But if you think about the non-STAHLGRUBER CapEx probably relative to 2018, probably flat to maybe down a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Albertine from Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Jamie.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Appreciate it. I wanted to ask just an operating question, if I could, and then maybe a strategic question, if I could sneak one in.","First on the operating side, just wanted to get your sense on \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks, I dialed in a little late \u2013 severity versus frequency trends and sort of how you're thinking about starting to lap sort of the beginning of the uptick in organic growth in North America and how we should think about that from a modeling perspective.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, again, we anticipate that organic growth in Q4 is going to come in a little bit from where it's been. I mentioned that in the prepared remarks largely because we are absolutely focused on making sure that each incremental revenue dollar has good margin. We do not want to chase low-margin business down the rabbit hole, because at the end of the day, that doesn't do us any good. And the easiest way to drive revenue is to drop your prices.","The reality is when you have a market position like we do, which is the largest in all of our global businesses, if you will, we've got the deepest inventory, we think the best logistics and distribution system, the primary way people compete against us is through price and drop in price, and we're being very disciplined not to do that.","So, I would expect and we do expect in Q4 that the organic is going to come in a little bit. Recall that last year in Q4 was the best organic growth of the year at 5%. And then going into 2019, again, we think 2019 organic is still going to be very good. Don't get me wrong, it's not going to zero or anything close, okay, but we don't think Q1 of next year is going to be another 7% quarter like it was in 2018.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","And you hear that...","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Yeah, sorry.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yes.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","I was just going to say just to clarify, the underlying trends from a frequency and severity perspective don't concern you in light of that. It's just that you're going to go after some higher-margin business and so forth, if I'm hearing you correctly.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","That's correct.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. And if I may, the strategic question, we noticed during the quarter, there had been a trial scheduled. I believe there was a settlement related to State Farm and a class action lawsuit. Believe this is several decades now of back and forth on litigation related not only in parts. Do you have any sort of views on that and how we should think about State Farm potentially flowing into the business?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Sure. Absolutely. After years of questions about State Farm where we've said no new news, there's finally been some new news. While not widely publicized, in September, State Farm reached a settlement agreement in its legal battle against the class action suit that had been going on in the courts for 20 years. The initial lawsuit related to the use of aftermarket parts in the collision repair process. And while that court case was going on over the past 20 years, State Farm largely had not used aftermarket parts in the repair of vehicles for their policyholders.","This agreement needs to be finalized by the court, which we understand is going to happen in December of 2018. To our knowledge, State Farm has not made any public statement regarding its intention to reinstate the use of aftermarket parts. But once the lawsuit is out of the way, we would not be surprised if, ultimately, State Farm joins most every other auto insurer and begins to slowly reintroduce the utilization of our high-quality, cost-effective certified aftermarket parts which, by the way, come with a lifetime warranty.","While we obviously can't comment as to when or to what extent State Farm may ramp up its use of aftermarket parts, we generally view this as a positive for our industry, as State Farm is the largest insurer in the United States of automobiles with about a 18% share. So, we continue to meet with State Farm on a regular basis. We meet with their leadership to discuss joint business opportunities. And we will certainly let you know during a future quarterly call if there are any material updates, but we view this as a positive.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Understood. Thank you for the \u2013 taking the questions and best of luck.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Hi. Good morning, Bret.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","A question and I ask for clarification. On the STAHLGRUBER factoring comments, are you looking at a factoring program for STAHLGRUBER's collections, or I guess where people were maybe looking more at it more (00:51:50) as more of a payables program where you are extending STAHLGRUBER's payables and basically reducing inventory? And it wasn't quite clear from that first line.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, Bret, it's a yes and a yes, okay? So, clearly, in terms of the cost of funding that was being paid by STAHLGRUBER, we believe there are synergies associated with cost of funding that we will avail of that's part of our overall synergy program with STAHLGRUBER.","And then with regards to the payables piece of it also, as I mentioned previously, we have activities in the works, and we will \u2013 once we're ready to inform the broader markets we sadly will, but at this point of time, we continue to operate on an as-is basis. We clearly believe there is an opportunity. But again, this needs to be carefully architected to ensure that we have all the relevant stakeholders on the same page. We enjoy good relationships with our suppliers, and we want to make sure that this is done for the mutual benefit of everybody.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is open.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Good morning, everyone. So my question is on the trajectory of North America EBITDA margins. I'm wondering how long do you think it will take to offset some of the cost pressures and start delivering rising margins again, or is the message you want to deliver to us today, Nick, that you may be in a chase for a few more quarters?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So again, as both Varun and I mentioned, if you take out the impact of the self-serve business and basically the scrap hit in the third quarter, our North American EBITDA margins were flat year-over-year. So while in the first quarter they were down substantially, the second quarter a little bit less, during the third quarter, again excluding scrap, they were flat. So we are making that positive progress, if you will. Even with scrap, our expectation is in Q4, North American margins will still be a little bit under 2017 fourth quarter levels, if you will, but again the gap will close even further. And then obviously, as we get into 2019, the year-over-year comps become a little bit easier. So we think we're getting close, Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Stephanie.","Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the organic growth in Europe, if maybe you could speak to the cadence maybe throughout the quarter and if these price-cutting efforts you're seeing from competitors was largely quarter-specific or kind of how we should think of it as we progressed in the fourth quarter. Thanks.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So the reality is the competitive nature over in Europe, with pricing coming really from everybody, because when you're the market leader, that's the easiest way to compete against us is with price, was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. There wasn't a huge uptick or downtick at the end of the quarter. So we are anticipating for Q4 a little bit of an uptick but not a huge uptick in inorganic growth in Europe, if you will.","Again, we were at 2% which was below our expectation, below the expectations of our leadership team in Europe. They're working hard to move that up a bit. But again, we're not going to do that at the expense of margins. And we do anticipate that gross margins, EBITDA margins in Europe in the fourth quarter will again continue to nudge up a bit just like they have in the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Chris.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Hey, good morning, Chris.","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to kind of dig in on Europe a little bit about the pricing environment, I saw GPC's AAG business was a little bit above where you were. Wanted to get a sense if some of these North American guys are the source of the pressure on pricing. Have you seen it elsewhere?","And then, secondly, I understand the macroeconomic concerns, but covering the aftermarket retailers in the U.S. generally speaking, when economic conditions tighten, you tend to see those aftermarket growth accelerate as people forgo car sales, et cetera. Is there a reason why this wouldn't apply for your own business in Europe?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, great question. The reality is we're seeing pricing pressure, if you will, from our competitors really across the European landscape. It's not just in the UK where Alliance which is owned by GPC or Parts Authority which is owned by Uni-Select operate. It's really across the board, if you will. And part of it is, in general with the warm, really warm summer, I mean, activity was a little bit slower than typical. There's no doubt about that. And I think everybody was scrambling, if you will, to get as much revenue as they could. Again, we're assuming that Q4 is going to be a similar quarter, but we have to wait and see.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. And I'll just kind of add to what Nick mentioned, listen, there are wage pressures and fuel pressures in Europe also. We do know that fuel is kind of across the board globally, a global phenomena in terms of where oil is currently trading. In addition to that, we do have some competitors who have been on a fairly aggressive branch opening spree in certain markets.","Again, as we've kind of reiterated time and time again earlier but also on the call today, we are highly, highly focused on profitable margin, margin-accretive business. A number of folks want to go down the path of margin-free, calorie-free revenue and good luck to them. We believe the macroeconomic headwinds with regards to fuel, freight, wages is not going to abate anytime soon, and so there needs to be that margin discipline continuing within our business.","Given our position across every geographic segment but also every product line, we believe that the customer service, our footprint and the reliability of our service that we continue to deliver will come through to our key partners. In the UK, for example, we've seen some great key account wins come through, the BT Fleet, for example, Halfords, Formula One, among others, these are multiyear contracts. And again, it is a validation of the investments we've put into our footprint, into our advanced logistics centers and, clearly, we believe that that's what will win the day in the longer term.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Healy from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Wanted to ask just kind of a bigger pictures question. Four or five months ago you guys had an Analyst Day and now we're starting to see some additional announcements, and I think we'd applaud those with some of the additions to the board and the meaningful step on the repurchase side. I was just hoping to kind of get your thoughts on what drove the timing for those items and especially the buyback. I mean, given the stock price, to me it seems incredibly attractive here, but just kind of a big change for you guys and I was hoping to get more color on each of those.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Sure, John, and thanks for participating this morning. Look, we're a 20-year-old company now and we've matured a lot. We've got the better part of $12 billion of annualized revenue. And so, we recognize that the days of 26% compounded annual revenue growth like we've had in the last 10 years that it's coming to a close. We're just too big to continue to grow at that pace.","We will still be active in terms of corporate development, but we also recognize that we've just completed the largest transaction in the history of the company with STAHLGRUBER at \u20ac1.6 billion of revenue. And we need to be laser-focused on making sure that that integration is effective and efficient and we need a little time to digest things. We've got a lot of capital available. We've got great cash flow and, quite frankly, we've got the ability to invest in the growth of the business and repay some debt and have some capital available to give back to our shareholders. And in chatting with the board, it just felt like we were approaching the time to be a bit more balanced in our capital allocation strategy.","Certainly with the stock at these levels, which in terms of your estimates, the analyst estimates for 2019, we're trading below 9 times EBITDA and below 11 times adjusted earnings per share. These are historically low multiples and creating an attractive opportunity to buy some shares. So when you take everything into consideration, the board just felt this was the right time and the right price level to introduce the share repurchase program, if you will.","The addition of the new directors, terrific. We had one director, Paul Meister, had been with us for the better part of 17 years, roll off in May. We went through a very detailed search process. We didn't get to the right folks in time to include them in the 2018 proxy, and so they got added in August and, quite frankly, these are three absolutely terrific people. They're going to add a lot to the board. And so we were fine given their talent to expand the board from what was 10 to 12. And we're going to continue to keep our eyes open again for always to be on the search for good talent, whether that's at the management level or at the board level. So no real changes there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Van Horn from B. Riley FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Hey, Chris.","Dan Drawbaugh - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. Hi. This is Dan Drawbaugh on the line for Chris. Thanks for taking our question.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Drawbaugh - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Good morning. Just on the Specialty business, the growth in the quarter was obviously little bit of an acceleration from the first half. And I don't think we've seen that growth rate from that segment in several quarters now. And I'm just wondering if you can talk about the sustainability there. Is this the result of the shift towards light trucks flowing down to you guys, or is it more of a onetime event in the quarter?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","No, we don't think it's one-time. We would expect that Q4, based on the run rate of activity coming out of Q3, that Q4 is going to be pretty strong as well. Probably not going to be 8%, but it's going to be \u2013 it should be pretty healthy.","It's a combination of things. You can't put your finger on just one thing. Is it the fact that truck and SUV sales have been very high now for sustained period of time? That ultimately feeds into it, kind of the RV marketplace being very strong, again, a good portion of the revenue from Specialty goes into the RV marketplace. Some of it is just the day-to-day tackling that the team is doing, some of these new exclusive relationships that we have are helping, if you will.","So it's a lot of things. I would not suggest that people should model 8% growth for Specialty in 2019 because the industry isn't growing anywhere near that capacity or near that rate. But, again, we do think it's going to be a pretty good Q4 and we're optimistic about next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Stember from C.L. King. Your line is open.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Hi, Scott.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Hey, good morning, Scott.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","In North America, just a quick two-pronged question, maybe just talk about your ability to raise prices and being mindful of the elasticity of demand versus OEM. And with State Farm, just remind us how big the aftermarket piece is of your North American business. Thank you.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","So, Scott, let me take the first part of the question and then Nick will pick up the second part of your question regarding State Farm. So with regards to our North America business, as you would have heard in my comments earlier this morning, if we were to exclude our self-service operations, essentially, that's where the scrap price hit, our gross margins are actually up on a sequential basis and also up on a year-over-year basis. So if you think about it from that perspective, that business has been actively managing its margin expectations.","We've mentioned this previously also, the macroeconomic headwinds, fuel, freight, vehicle expenses, wage inflation, we do not expect that to abate in the short term. And so really that's where we need to have a margin enhancement program that the team has been pushing incredibly hard on to offset those cost pressures.","We believe we've seen the stickability of those pieces. It's certainly coming through our results. And again, as I mentioned, the team is working hard and continues to push. The unfortunate part is, because our North America business includes the self-service operations also, the headline numbers that you see on a reported basis seem to show it's actually still dropping, but quite frankly, if you were to take the scrappy side effect, that business has actually been delivering against the initiatives that we put in place earlier this year.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","And as it relates to the second part which is kind of the overall size of the aftermarket business, as we always disclose in our standard slides, there's a pie chart in there, if you take kind of 2017, 2018, you kind of annualize STAHLGRUBER for a full year, the North American aftermarket business is somewhere around 21%, 22% of our consolidated revenues, if you will, so somewhere north of a $3.5 billion business.","Operator","At this time, I turn the call back to Nick Zarcone.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, we know we ran a little bit late here, but we wanted to make sure we had a chance to get most of the questions out on the table, so we appreciate everybody hanging in there. Again, we thank you very much for your time and attention.","Again, we think this was a very good quarter for us. We saw very good revenue growth in our businesses. The European margins are up, the Specialty margins are up. Again excluding scrap, the North American margins were flat on a year-over-year basis. We do have headwinds coming at us from scrap in Q4. Again, that's $0.04 between Q3 and Q4, $0.04 of the earnings change, if you will. I'd love to be able to never talk about scrap but, unfortunately, goes up and down and we have to deal with it.","The key takeaway is we are very focused on driving our margins. We're very focused on improving our cash flow. We had a great quarter in that regard in the third quarter. And again, we think the share repurchase program, it's just the right time to do that and to return a little bit of capital to our shareholders.","So we appreciate your time and attention and look forward to chatting with you at the end of the fourth quarter. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Director of Investor Relations.","Joseph P. Boutross","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This morning, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results, and provided our full year 2014 guidance.","In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Quinn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rob and John have some prepared remarks, and then we will open the call for questions. In addition to the telephone access for today's call, we are providing an audiocast via the LKQ website. A replay of the audiocast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call.","Before we begin with our discussion, I would like to remind everyone that statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties, some of which are not currently known to us.","Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it was made, except as required by law.","Please refer to our Form 10-K and other subsequent documents filed with the SEC and the press release we issued this morning for more information on potential risks. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. As normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the next few days.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Revenue reached a new quarterly high of $1.32 billion in the quarter, an increase of 23.3% as compared to Q4 2012. Net income for the fourth quarter was $77.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.26, a 23.8% increase over the $0.21 reported for the fourth quarter in 2012.","Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 9.9% for the quarter. Total organic revenue growth for the quarter was 7.7%.","For the full year, our EPS was $1.02, representing an increase of 17.2% from the $0.87 reported in 2012. Our reported earnings in both years had some special items that I'd like to highlight to help in your evaluation of the year-over-year results.","Please note, 2013 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.04 per share resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, a loss of -- on debt extinguishment and a change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, all of which we exclude when setting our EPS guidance. Additionally, full year 2012 diluted earnings per share included a $0.04 per share gain from the settlement of a previously disclosed lawsuit and a $0.01 per share loss related to restructuring and acquisition-related expenses and the change in fair value of contingent consideration. So all things considered, I'm really pleased with the year-over-year growth.","Revenue reached a record $5.1 billion in 2013, an increase of 23% as compared to 2012. Net income for the full year was $311.6 million compared with $261.2 million for the prior year, an increase of 19.3%. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for 2013 was a strong 11%. Total organic revenue growth for the year was 9.3%.","During the fourth quarter, we purchased over 70,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, bringing our full year 2013 vehicle procurement to approximately 281,000, which is a 7% increase over 2012. As noted in previous calls, in 2012, we aligned the reporting structure of our heavy-duty truck salvage with the geographic reporting structure of our wholesale operations. So the aforementioned procurement numbers include the units we purchased for our 26 heavy-duty truck salvage yards.","As we enter 2014, the volume at the auctions is robust and the outlook for supply remains steady. Despite the flat pricing dynamic in the quarter, the pricing relief we're witnessing early in Q1 is encouraging trend into 2014, a year that many industry observers have projected a softening in the used car market, which we believe will translate into pricing relief at our salvage auctions. For full year 2013, we witnessed a drop of approximately 3% in our average vehicle cost compared to 2012.","In our self-service retail business, during the fourth quarter, we acquired over 120,000 low-cost self-service and crush-only cars, bringing our full year 2013 self-service procurement to approximately 513,000 units, which is a 23% increase over 2012.","And lastly, on North America, during the quarter, we continued to make significant progress with the intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services. CCC ONE's total repair platform is now available to approximately 4,200 users of the CCC ONE Control, Optimize and Innovate product packages, up from 2,000 users in Q3. Though off a small base, the revenue and number of purchase orders processed through the CCC platform both grew sequentially, 197% and 175%, respectively, during the quarter. Clearly, the trend towards shops adopting this feature within the CCC platform is gaining traction.","Now turning to our European operations. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to increase market share. In Q4, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 25%. For branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 19% during the fourth quarter. For full year 2013, ECP had organic revenue growth of 32%, and for branches open more than 12 months, organic revenue growth was 21%. With this type of continued financial performance and the impressive track record of ECP's management team to effectively open, grow and gain market share, I am pleased to announce that we approved an additional 20 new ECP branches for 2014.","And now a quick update on ECP's collision program. During the quarter, we again witnessed strong double-digit year-over-year growth of approximately 80% with our collision parts sales at ECP. I am also pleased with the growth in our collision parts offering in the fourth quarter, which today stands at over 19,000 SKUs, which represents an increase of 26% year-over-year. In addition, during the fourth quarter, ECP added 5 additional insurers into their pilot program, bringing our total carrier relationships to 13. Many pilot program participants continue to appreciate the value proposition of ECP's collisions offerings and continue to increase their collision parts spend monthly. During Q1 of this year, one of the 2 insurance companies we signed in 2013 extended their agreement for 3 years. In addition, based on recent dialogue, I expect that in 2014, we will become the key supplier to many of those 11 pilot programs remaining.","For our Continental European operations at Sator, we have approved the opening of an additional distribution center in France that will allow us to serve a significant additional hard parts customer base in southeastern France. We expect to be operational by mid-Q2 of this year and are excited about the opportunities this market provides. Also, I continue to be pleased with the purchasing synergies we are witnessing at Sator and I am confident that we are on target to reach the metrics we indicated when we announced the acquisition.","Now moving on to acquisitions and development initiatives. On January 3, 2014, the company completed its previously announced acquisition of Keystone Automotive Operations, a leading distributor and marketer of specialty aftermarket equipment and accessories in North America. Keystone markets products to serve 6 category segments: truck and off-road; speed and performance; recreational vehicle; towing; wheels, tires and performance handling; and miscellaneous accessories.","Within those categories, Keystone carries approximately 150,000 stocking units and have access to about 300,000 total SKUs.","SEMA, the Specialty Equipment Market Association, estimates the total U.S. vehicle specialty market to be approximately $31 billion. Excluding certain products that Keystone doesn't currently distribute in meaningful volumes such as tires, we believe that Keystone's addressable market today is approximately 5 billion, and little, if any of this, overlaps with our existing business. So Keystone provides us with material additional segments to address.","With all the acquisitions, we look for strong management teams who want to stay with the company and help us further grow the business. And with Keystone, we clearly have the right management team in place. Though we have only owned Keystone since January, their management team has moved rapidly on synergy and cost-saving initiatives. And today, I am pleased to report that they have already integrated 10 of their cross stocks into existing LKQ and Keystone aftermarket collision warehouses.","During Q4 of 2013, we also acquired 3 additional companies: in addition -- in an aftermarket, parts and remanufactured bumper distributor in Wisconsin; a new and refurbished wheel business in New York; and a self-service operation in Indiana. Clearly, our ability to identify and execute effective acquisitions is cornerstone to our strategy, and 2013 was no exceptions, a year in which we added 20 new businesses to the LKQ portfolio.","And now a quick update on ECM parts, our Australian joint venture with the largest insurer in the market, Suncorp insurance. ECM parts is on track to begin dismantling and selling recycled auto parts from the first wave of Suncorp salvage vehicles in early Q2 2014. In addition, ECM parts has received its first shipment of aftermarket parts for use in an Australian-specific certification program, operated by NSF, an independent testing organization. We expect the certified aftermarket parts catalog to increase in size over the coming quarters, and we'll have a significant certified part offering for our Australian body-shop partners by Q4 of 2014.","At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more details on the financial results of the quarter.","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin with our prepared remarks, I want to comment on a topic of discussion regarding LKQ over the past few months, namely unfounded allegations made regarding the quality of our accounting practices.","The management of LKQ and our Board of Directors, auditors and other constituents take seriously any allegation of accounting irregularities or ethical complaints made against the company or any member of management. We have a comprehensive compliance program to ensure that the financial statements signed by Rob, Michael, our board and me are in compliance with GAAP. We operate a whistleblower hotline, where we encourage employees to come forth with any concerns. We review at least quarterly with our Audit Committee any complaints regarding accounting or auditing matters. We have a talented internal audit department that reviews our systems and controls that has direct access to the Audit Committee. We involve numerous independent advisers, such as valuation firms and outside legal counsel in the preparation of our financial reports. Our banking partners, underwriters and other constituents regularly perform due diligence on the company, management and our books and records.","In addition, our external auditors, Deloitte & Touche, provide an independent assessment of the financial statements and of the quality of our internal control procedures.","The company, our auditors and our audit committee have reviewed each and every allegation ever asserted regarding our accounting practices. As I speak today, I can confirm there are no outstanding or unresolved matters. I can also confirm that although there have been queries, as one would expect in any large public company, there has never been a complaint found to have any material substance or resulted in a change in our books and records. I also note that Deloitte has always issued clean audit opinions, both with respect to our compliance with GAAP and the effectiveness of our internal control of our financial reporting.","Within the next few days, we will be filing our Form 10-K with the SEC. While I take my responsibility for those statements very seriously, I rest well knowing the professionalism, integrity and character of the people involved in the preparation and verification of those documents.","Of course, our shareholders, bondholders, banks, employees and other constituents should expect nothing less of us. With the integrity of our company well established, in my opinion, the more important thing is how we can continue to create shareholder value. So that said, I want to share with you some of the success we've had in Q4 2013 and some of the plans we have for the current year.","Beginning with revenue, our Q4 2013 revenue of $1,317,000,000 was an increase of $249 million compared to Q4 last year or an increase of 23%. It's obviously difficult to quantify exactly the impact of having Christmas holiday fall on a Wednesday compared to a Tuesday in 2012. Our sense is that, overall, it probably had a slight negative impact on sales, but was helpful to our cash flow.","For Q4, our total organic revenue growth was 7.7%, and we delivered an additional growth of 15.8% from acquisitions. Rob mentioned that in Q4 2013, organic growth for parts and services was 9.9%. Within that, we saw our North American operations grow organically 5.9%, while the European segment grew 25.2%. We completed 3 acquisitions in Q4 2013, bringing our full year count to 20 transactions.","Total change in other revenue, which is where we record our scrap commodity sales, was a slightly negative 0.3%. That was mainly due to the negative organic growth of 5.7% driven by the closure of one of our furnaces that was processing excess aluminum wheels. The average price we received for scrap steel was higher by about 2% year-over-year, $229 a ton this year versus $225 a ton in Q4 2012.","Other revenue was 11.1% of total revenue compared to 13.8% for the same period last year and has continued the trend of becoming a lower percentage of and less significant to our total revenue, although it is still susceptible to commodity price swings.","In Q4 2013, revenue for our self-serve business was $101 million or 7.7% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 32% of this revenue was parts sales included in North American parts and services, and 68% scrap and core sales included in other revenue.","Our gross margin for Q4 2013 was $546 million or 41.4% of revenue, a decline of approximately 30 basis points from our gross margin percentage in Q4 2012.","Acquisitions in the European segment were the primary cause for this change, with Sator causing approximately 70 basis points of the decline and the paint companies in the U.K. adding the further 20 basis points of decline.","We saw net improvements in the other lines of business and a favorable mix, which offset all but 30 basis points of the impact from those acquisitions.","Custodian warehouse costs were 8.6% of revenue in Q4 2013, a 20-basis-point improvement over the 8.8% in Q4 last year. Our European operations are driving this figure lower as they become a larger proportion of the total revenue base.","Distribution costs were 8.5% this quarter as compared to 9.2% in the same quarter last year, an improvement of 70 basis points. Sator has lowered distribution cost, and that acquisition drove 30 basis points of the improvement.","In North America and the U.K., we saw the benefits of higher revenue leveraging these costs. We also saw lower fuel cost contributing about 10 basis points to this improvement.","Selling and G&A expenses decreased from 12.3% of revenue in Q4 last year to 12.2% in Q4 this year. Again, this improvement is primarily related to Sator, which has higher sales per customer and, therefore, lower SG&A expense. In total, facility and warehouse distribution, selling, general and administrative costs were 29.3% of revenue in Q4 2013 compared to 30.3% of revenue in Q4 2012, an improvement of 100 basis points.","Sator accounts for approximately 60 basis points of that change.","I mentioned on our last quarterly call that excluding the impacts from acquisitions, we appear to be getting leverage in these costs in North America, and we continue to see that leverage coming through in Q4 2013 figures.","During Q4 2013, we recorded $2.8 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses. These are primarily related to a tuck-in acquisition we completed in the Netherlands.","Depreciation and amortization was 1.8% of revenue during Q4 this year as compared to 1.6% of revenue in Q4 2012. Depreciation and amortization grew from $17.1 million in Q4 2012 to $23.1 million in Q4 2013, an increase of 35%.","It's worth taking a moment to note that this figure is growing faster than revenue, primarily because of the amortization of intangibles associated with our acquisition program. When we complete an acquisition, we are required to identify and then amortize intangibles, such as the value of customer relationships. These are noncash charges which impact our net income and earnings per share, but are not related to future needs for capital asset investments.","Other expenses net increased $15.2 million in the 3 months ended December 31, 2013 -- excuse me, increased to $15.2 million compared to the $7.7 million in the same period last year, an increase of $7.5 million.","Interest expense was $6 million higher due to higher debt levels combined with higher interest rates on our senior notes. Expenses in Q4 2013 related to adjustments of contingent consideration were $739,000 compared to income of $144,000 last year in the same period.","Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 4.5%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.3% compared to 35.6% in Q4 last year. We continue to see some benefit from lower foreign tax rates as our international business becomes a larger percentage of the total company.","On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.26 in Q4 2013 compared to $0.21 in Q4 2012, an improvement of 24%. The combination of acquisition-related expenses and contingent purchase price adjustments impacted EPS by less than $0.01 for Q4 in both 2012 and 2013.","Switching to our year-to-date cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $428 million for 2013 compared to $206 million in 2012. Obviously, a key driver of the year-over-year improvement was our higher net income. We also had favorable working capital movements, including lower cash payments for income taxes of $36 million due to prepayments made in 2012. Cash payments for incentive compensation were $14 million lower during 2013. You may recall that in Q4 2012, we had an inventory build partly in anticipation of port disruptions, which we did not repeat in 2013. The timing of inventory and other payments, particularly at year end in 2013, gave us a favorable working capital benefit, which exceeded our expectations.","Capital spending was $90 million in 2013, only $2 million higher than the $88 million in 2012. Some of the projects we anticipated for completion in 2013 will be carried over to 2014, as I'll mention in a moment when discussing guidance. We spent $408 million on acquisitions, the largest being Sator, which accounted for $273 million of the total.","On the cash flow statement, you will note that we also show a $9 million investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary related to our Australian joint venture. We ended 2013 with $1.3 billion of debt, and cash and cash equivalents were $150 million.","As of December 31, 2013, availability in our credit facility and accounts receivable facility was $1.2 billion. In early July -- excuse me, in early January, we used some of the balance sheet cash and borrowing capacity to finance Keystone Automotive Operations' acquisition. On a pro forma basis, availability after that transaction was approximately $700 million.","Turning to guidance. As we stated in the past, our guidance excludes any restructuring costs and transaction costs, gains, losses, contingent purchase price adjustments, capital expenditures or cash flows associated with acquisitions. Our guidance for 2014 for organic revenue growth for parts and services is 8% to 10%. We are expecting North America to continue to perform much like we saw last year. Europe's growth will likely abate slightly as the new ECP locations will not be as impactful as those that contributed to last year's growth. In addition, in May 2014, we will reach the anniversary of Sator, and in August, the anniversary of the U.K. paint deals. These lines will not be growing at the same rate that our core ECP business has been growing.","So while we remain bullish on the ECP growth story, it will be slightly diluted by other slowly growing lines of businesses as they reach their 1-year anniversary.","Our net income and earnings per share guidance ranges are $400 million to $430 million and $1.30 to $1.40, respectively. Our guidance for capital expenditures is $110 million to $140 million. This guidance is higher than the $90 million we reported for 2013, primarily because we are that much bigger a company, and we do have some carryover projects from 2013 that are still in the development stage.","We still believe the majority of the spending is associated with our growth as opposed to being replacement projects.","We are projecting cash flow from operations of approximately $375 million. And obviously, this level would be lower than the $428 million generated in 2013.","As we have seen in 2012 and 2013, working capital movements can cause this number to fluctuate at year end in ways that are sometimes difficult to project. In 2012, working capital changes were less favorable than we expected. And in 2013, they were more favorable. Our 2014 projection has assumed what we would consider normal movements.","We don't provide quarterly guidance for specific line items, but I do want to give the analyst community a few data points to assist with modeling.","On the December 6, 2013, call, we discussed the then-pending Keystone Automotive Operations acquisition that subsequently closed on January 4 this year. As a reminder, we expect that acquisition will generate approximately $700 million of revenue in 2014. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30% range and approximately 10% EBITDA margin. We are still working through the opening balance sheets and the identification of the intangible assets, but you should anticipate that our depreciation and amortization will continue to rise disproportionately to our other costs simply due to an increase in amortization of the intangible assets for Keystone, along with the carryover effect of the acquisitions we completed in 2013.","Obviously, these are noncash charges to rinse, but we have included an estimate of them in our guidance.","We've previously disclosed our joint venture in Australia. We expect that this operation will incur initial start-up losses that must be expensed. Because of the JV and the accounting rules, we're not able to tax effect those losses at this time. We are anticipating those losses to be approximately $0.02 per share this year. This loss is built into our guidance, and we expect that by the time we exit 2015, this operation will no longer be generating losses.","We expect that the tax rate will be in the 34.5% to 35% range. There'll be some variability in this rate depending upon the mix of foreign earnings. We forecast minimal discrete items in 2014.","I note above that other revenue, which includes scrap and core sales, has been falling as a percent of our revenue, notwithstanding commodity prices create some variability in our income statement quarter-to-quarter. We assume that the majority of our commodity prices would be flat to Q4 2013. Unfortunately, in the last few weeks, we have seen prices drifting lower, and thus far, Q4 -- Q1 prices are about 3% lower than the Q4 2013 levels, but hopefully, this will be a short-term issue.","As our foreign operations grow, foreign exchange could cause additional volatility. The pound sterling is high level and the Canadian dollar has been under pressure. We are taking the steps to counter the impact from the weak Canadian dollar. The high sterling would be a concern if it fell because our U.S. dollar earnings would decline.","The Manheim Index remains high. Q4 2013 was essentially flat to Q3 2013 and was down year-over-year by less than 1%. We remain optimistic that as new car production continues to recover, used car prices will begin to fall, but obviously, we haven't seen that come through yet in a meaningful way.","A couple of debt-related and cash flow items. We expect to have approximately $42 million in mandatory debt repayments in 2014. In addition, we have contingent purchase price adjustments of approximately $52 million, which we expect to process in the first half of 2014.","And as a reminder, the bond we issued last year increased our average borrowing rate after May 2013. Unless we see an increase in LIBOR or further refinancings or a large acquisition, we're not expecting our Q4 effective interest rate of 4.5% to materially change in 2014.","Now one final item to mention. There are a number of tranches of restricted stock units for Section 16 officers vesting this week. I believe that most of the Section 16 officers have 10b5-1 plans in place that call for automatic selling of a portion of their shares to pay the related taxes. So we will be filing Form 4S with the SEC disclosing those sales in the next few days.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Rob.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, John. To summarize, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2013 performance. I am proud of the achievements we made in 2013 and confident that the strategic framework we have in place for our operating segments has positioned the company well for continued growth in 2014 and beyond.","As we enter the new year, the trends in our North American business are favorable. New vehicle sales hit 15.6 million in 2013, up nearly 8% from 2012.","During 2013, the vehicles in operation reached the highest point on record since Q3 2008. This trend, combined with an improving employment landscape, should lead to an increased driving during peak times, which would bode well for our North American collision business and for our recently acquired Keystone business.","As I am sure everyone is aware, this winter has posed some unique challenges for all businesses, and we were unfortunately not exempt from the negative impacts of the winter in North America. As a company, we witnessed a number of days in multiple key U.S. and Canadian markets where we were forced to close due to extreme weather conditions. From Texas to Maine, many cities declared state of emergency, forcing motorists off the roads. While this has caused some headwinds for Q1, we are optimistic that there's a backlog of work that will make its way through the base of repairers throughout the course of 2014. In fact, last week was the first week of the year that we had no weather disruptions, and we posted our highest revenue week ever.","As part of our growth and diversification strategy, Europe continues to provide exciting opportunities for the company, and we are quite pleased with the performance of this segment so far and the value it has created for our stockholders. We plan to expand our ECP branch count in the U.K. and continue to focus on driving collision part sales through their existing network while simultaneously leveraging ECP's purchasing power with Sator in attempt to maximize the synergies and cost savings that exist between their respective suppliers and product mix.","And lastly, with our development efforts, we will continue to focus on our core North American collision business by looking at additional salvage locations and product-specific aftermarket businesses. We will also continue to explore aftermarket mechanical parts businesses that will serve as a foothold for operations in other European markets. We have never wavered from this acquisition strategy and are pleased with the pipeline of opportunities for the company.","In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication of our 25,000-plus employees, delivered for the company, our stockholders and most importantly, our customers in 2013. I am equally proud of our team's commitment and laser focus on delivering that same level of success and continued growth in 2014. This focus allows us to project solid EPS gains for 2014. At the low end of our guidance, it represents a 23% increase over 2013 adjusted results, and at the high end, we would increase EPS 32% year-over-year.","And with that, Rob, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe I could start with the weather issue. I think a lot of people would have expected that given the harsh weather and the accident frequency increase, we would see more volume in Q4 and Q1. I'm guessing people don't factor in the lost selling days. But given what Copart said about volumes being so high recently, shouldn't we expect that to start to flow through in the back half of Q1 and then into Q2?","Robert L. Wagman","I think that's fair, Craig. Obviously, there is a backlog at the shops. I did listen to the Copart call as well, and I think that backlog at the salvage auctions bodes well for us, too, in terms of buying. There'll be plenty of salvage available. And generally speaking, when there's more salvage available, we can buy at little bit better rates.","Let me just talk about the quarter so far. We did face quite a bit of disruption from the weather with major cities basically shut down. We had to deal with our own distribution concerns, but we also faced many customers that were closed due to the weather. We are certain there's a backlog at the shops just from our data that we've had with our customers. And we do expect that to work through the back half of the quarter and into other quarters as well throughout the course of the year.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then shifting into Europe, I'm sure there's a large investor base that's interested in your progress there. What's the pipeline look like, Rob? Are you more focused on executing what you've got, or are there opportunities that you think could happen in 2014?","Robert L. Wagman","We're focused on both, Craig, both on, obviously, execution, but we do have people over on our side doing some M&A work, and the pipeline looks good. It takes time. They're relationship-driven acquisitions where we have to get to know the companies, make sure we're getting the best in the marketplace. But I do anticipate more acquisitions in that marketplace. Whether it be 2014 or 2015, I'm not sure. But certainly, the pipeline looks very good there.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then one more, and I'll get back in the queue. But John, I appreciate your comments on sort of the accounting and the discipline behind that. Can you confirm whether we should expect to see an unqualified opinion in the 10-K and whether goodwill is carried at an appropriate level based on how you've carried it in past 10-Ks?","John S. Quinn","I don't want to speak for Deloitte, because they haven't, obviously, issued their opinion yet, but I expect a clean opinion and with no goodwill impairment issues whatsoever. We completed our goodwill testing, as we do every year in Q4, and cleared that hurdle handsomely, frankly.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Albertine with Stifel.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","On the -- I just want to get a sense for given the Keystone acquisition, you came in at the end of the day toward the lower end of your full year guidance. I wanted to understand if that was more timing-related or sort of expense-driven or if there was something else in there that was more of a pressure than you anticipated in the -- toward the end of the year?","John S. Quinn","Keystone didn't really impact it, I don't think at all, really, because we obviously completed that in January. I think we had talked a little bit about the timing of Christmas. We weren't sure whether that was going to hurt us. Our sense is things both in North America and in Europe really slowed down in the back 2 weeks of December, frankly. I don't know that we would want to blame necessarily anything on that, but our sense is that, that probably did hurt the sales a little bit in Q4.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I appreciate that. And if I could ask one more just on gross margin. It looks like while down year-over-year, and you attributed I think some of that pressure certainly to Sator and some international growth, however, it looks like the degradation actually has improved, if you will. I'm trying to get a sense for how you're looking at gross margin trajectory going forward and how that contributes to your expectations for FY '14.","John S. Quinn","Sure, good question. The -- in the quarter, yes, we're down about 100 -- year-over-year in the quarter, we're down about 30 basis points. Sator and the paint deals are probably about 90 basis points negative, and we saw the rest of the business actually get some slight improvement, mostly in North America. So probably about 60 bps there offsetting that. So we do feel like we're continuing to get a little bit of traction in the North American business margin. Nothing dramatic yet because we really haven't seen cost of goods sold come down in terms of the commodity prices -- excuse me, in terms of the car prices, and commodities have not been our friend. They weren't our friend really last year throughout the whole year. They were volatile year-over-year, they ended up slightly negative on the whole year.","In terms of going forward, I just caution everybody, don't forget that Keystone Automotive is going to drag down margins again. We said that probably low 30% gross margins on that business. If you do the math, we're coming up with circa 110, 120 basis points negative impact to the entire company.","Failing that, you're just going to see the seasonality. Scrap, as I mentioned, is down right now. We think that's a short-term phenomenon. Turkey pulled out of the market earlier this year, which was I think partly driven by the political unrest there. So hopefully, that springs back, and we'll be at least at neutral, which is what we're projecting for the year. And then the rest of the gross margin, I don't really anticipate any dramatic changes, unless, as I've always said, \"unless something changes,\" which is commodity prices go up or we see some improvement in the cost of goods sold associated with the salvage business.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, we've -- I certainly appreciate the comments that you made about some of the accounting allegations. I guess from where we're sitting, the 2 questions that we're hearing from investors, the 2 points of concern, I think, are: One, are you seeing any additional pricing pressure from OEMs versus past years? Or I mean -- or really, is this what you characterize the price matching programs as kind of regional, kind of spotty and really nothing new?","John S. Quinn","I think I'll let Rob handle that one.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, John. John, the OEM price match is definitely regional and spotty, and they've been around for many years. GM in that recent report was highlighted, so we actually got some stats for the call. There are roughly 6,000 parts in that program. GM offers over 300,000 different SKUs, and less than 10% of their dealers even participate in the program. Apparently you have to get truckload shipments in order to participate. And then what we did, we also pulled our data since 2009 on all GM parts sold. We looked at all parts and our top 5 parts sold. In fact, the sales are actually in line with our overall performance of roughly about 6.6%. For the parts that are sold just in collision in North America, our growth was roughly 6.6%, and that's right in line. So this program doesn't appear to be hurting us. Like I said, the numbers are in line with other manufacturers. So we do see a little bit of regional, spotty attempts to apply this, but with 10% of the dealer network participating, it's really not a factor to our numbers.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's very helpful. And the second question would be on just the number of ECP stores that you think are needed to cover the U.K. market. I mean, the way we are thinking about it at least is the U.K. market, let's call it, 15% of the U.S. market, and if you look at the number of kind of AutoZone, GPC, O\u2019Reilly type stores, I mean, it's probably 15,000 to 20,000 in the U.S. So 15% of that, you're somewhere around 3,000 stores, and maybe haircut that a bit because there's a smaller DIY market and your stores tend to be bigger. But I mean, is it fair to assume that there's still room for more stores in the U.K.?","Robert L. Wagman","There is. As we announced, 20 new stores have been approved for this year, which, by the way, we expect to get them all done by Q2. So we'll have those 20 stores in, which will put our total at 165 if we get those 20 done.","We believe -- you've got to remember, the U.K. is roughly the size of Oregon. So it's much more compact, and the people are squeezed into a much smaller area. So it allows us to reach a much greater penetration with a smaller number of stores. We believe the right number, when it's all said and done, we have been saying pretty consistently, it's about 175 to 200. We're leaning towards the 200 number, John, because basically, you want to be within 5 miles of the population base we're trying to serve. So 200 in the U.K. Of course, we look at Ireland as another opportunity which we haven't touched yet as well. Northern Ireland, we're in, but not southern Ireland. So there's plenty of opportunity left, and those would be the full ECP branches that we talked about. We did talk about in some more remote areas, we call them ECP light branches, for example, maybe half the size with half the inventory, but be able to service a more remote area. We think another 25 of those. So 200 full branches, about 25 ECP light branches, so we still have at least a couple of years of buildout left, probably closer to 3.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit more specifically, John, if we could, and I mean clearly, we can add some of these numbers up, but I know that not all the accounting is finalized on the amortization for Keystone 2. But can you give us a rough sense now that it's closed in that you kind of have some numbers behind you what we should expect in overall accretion for this year?","John S. Quinn","You're talking from Keystone?","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, Keystone 2.","John S. Quinn","Yes, we haven't -- I mean, we haven't disclosed any specific number associated with that. I want to hold off doing that until we get the other numbers finalized. But I think, with -- if you take the EBITDA and use a fairly heavy rate for the depreciation and amortization, and then apply 4.5% interest. And then remember, that business is all in the U.S., or primarily in the U.S., it's going to be a full 39% tax rate. You'd probably come up with a pretty close number to what we're thinking in terms of pro forma-ing, Nate.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then second question is -- I mean, obviously, you guys are doing great in terms of the top line growth, and certainly, the acquisition part of the story continues to kind of increase the overall expense level a little bit. But can you give us a sense of maybe on a few of the internal programs or what you guys are looking at the overall expense side to let some of the accretion maybe from the past deals flow through, even as we continue to do maybe a few more tuck-ins here and there, just in terms of a sense of where we are on the opportunity to kind of limit a little bit of that expense growth going forward.","John S. Quinn","Yes, I'll start, and then maybe, Rob, you can join in. Obviously, we continue to look at the transportation network, and the strategy has always been to try to fill in the holes and shrink the average distance that the parts move, and we've done a lot of work on that recently, re-tendering some of those transportation links. We continue to look at opportunities when warehouses come available to see if we can co-locate the facilities. And obviously, we're talking with the new Keystone operations to see if there's any opportunities to co-locate those. I think, as an example, I think Rob talked to some of the -- was it 9?","Robert L. Wagman","10.","John S. Quinn","10 cross stocks that we've currently managed to co-locate. It's an evolution that just -- we don't want to run out and do -- replace warehouses before the leases are up, obviously. But just as the leases get expired, we try to see if we can co-locate facilities. It's not -- over time, I think some of the -- you will see the industry moving towards more of electronic procurement, the CCC product that we've been talking about. It's very early days, but you are seeing a lot of electronic ordering coming through for that. We're finding that's improving the accuracy, which means fewer returns, it's improving the -- obviously it's a lot easier to process an electronic order. And we're seeing that pressure coming not only from the shops, but also some of our insurance partners as well. I think we talked in the past about State Farm's product. They're trying to implement some kind of an electronic ordering process, which, at the moment, is actually causing a little bit more cost for us as opposed to less. But ultimately, I think the industry goes to that sort of a platform of some kind.","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, and I was going to highlight, Nate, on top of what John said, that the Keystone integration is a great example. I couldn't be more pleased with the speed of that integration, to have 10 cross stocks in about 1.5 months folded into our facilities. Stage 2 of that, now we've got them moved in, will be to start sharing deliveries wherever we can, of course, to try and gain efficiencies. We actually expect, as a result of that, our service levels to increase. We'll be able to get to the customers even quicker. So we're very pleased with that, and I think we'll continue to leverage that. And to John's second point on the CCC system, just one upgrade that's coming at the end of Q2, we'll be launching e-invoices to all of our customers through CCC, which will allow substantial savings for our customers, and hopefully, eventually us on the admin costs. So we're continuing to look at those opportunities to tuck in the businesses together, and I think the KAO acquisition is a great example of how fast we can move on that.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just last question, John. Usually, at this point, you kind of give us what could impact kind of the high or the low end of guidance in terms of what may or may not be in there. I would assume that you're probably not, even on the high end, including a lot of benefit if you roll out more of the collision parts or if the Manheim really does drop maybe a little bit more significantly. I assume that that's not in there at all, but could you give us a little sense for what is in there on the low end versus the high end?","John S. Quinn","Yes, I think Rob mentioned that Q1 started off a little bit slow. In the -- January, we were shut down in a number of places. We see other industries that are unrelated to us, like restaurants and so forth, saying their sales were down. I don't know if people didn't have accidents because they weren't driving to the restaurant or not. So to the extent how big the backlog is in those shops, we don't really know yet, but if -- our sense is that this is a much better weather environment than we had a year ago. The other things that could be impacting, obviously, are the FX rates, the weather for the rest of the year.","Scrap, we assume scrap is going to be relatively neutral to us. That could be favorable or unfavorable. I think the Manheim Index, we just assume sort of steady as it goes. I don't think there's much risk on the upside to that. Our bias is that it will probably come down over time. I've been saying that on this call, though, for a fair number of quarters. I still believe it to be true. I just, it's a question of when. Obviously, the new car production took a little bit of a step back in January. They think that's the weather, but the systemic trend there that we see is probably good for us. There has been some threats of port strikes. I don't think that's going to impact us yet. We're going to try to manage that and build up the inventory. If it looks serious, we'll try to get the product off the water sooner, but obviously, that could have an impact on us. Rob, did you...","Robert L. Wagman","That's right. Like I said, Nate, in my remarks that I was very encouraged by last week, the first week of the year that we were -- went a week without uninterrupted distribution runs, and we posted a record week. So it feels like there is some pent-up demand that's going to be coming through the system.","John S. Quinn","And Europe is -- I just mentioned that briefly. Europe is suffering from a very mild winter, frankly. While we were hit here, they were suffering from a mild winter, and that was unfortunate for them because things like battery sales and stuff just don't -- are not happening over there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A question on Keystone, now that you've had it for a bit. I guess if you could give us some thoughts on maybe how you see that business growing, going forward as it exists today, and then whether or not there's any change as far as the distribution model that you can make, either adding more direct or incremental points-of-sale that might change the growth rate from just a traditional 3-stepper into something else?","Robert L. Wagman","Sure. And as I mentioned, the speed of integration, we are thrilled with, Bret. I never envisioned getting 10 of these cross stocks already co-located, so we're very pleased with that. I personally have had the opportunity to interact with the associates at Keystone, the customers and suppliers. Keystone puts on 3, what they call, \"big shows\" with customers and vendors. They were all held in January and February. And I got to join 2 of those. It's really just getting to know people and know the space.","The Keystone people or new Keystone colleagues have presented us an opportunity in one major market to add additional warehouse, would make the sixth distribution center. We've already approved it. Great potential for market share gains in that particular market. The operation synergies, as I said, they're not just for cost savings, but I believe there's going to be meaningful enhancements to the customer service levels. We'll be able to get the parts to the customers even quicker, at less expense is what we hope. Back-office synergies, really in line with our expectations and progressing very well.","I just want to talk about some of the cross-selling opportunities as well. At the 3 shows, we actually launched LKQ products to those customer base. Basically 3 main product lines come into play here: ATK, which is our re-man engine division; Goodmark, which is our classic car collision parts; and our Coast to Coast line, which is wheels and accessories. Very well received by the customer base there and very interesting crossover of sales opportunities there.","It's early. I want to warn everybody that these are early days, but we actually are starting to talk with our European counterparts over at Sator and ECP of the potential of European distribution of these products. So overall, we're very pleased. I just want to share with you 2 things that happened at the shows for me personally just talking to some of the customers. I actually ran into a customer and said he needed a pickup bed for one of his units and we sold him a pickup bed on the spot. So there are some opportunities, and the second one that we saw was on paint. These are the customers and these other customers that Keystone markets to have many paint booths. So we already launched our paint teams into these new opportunities. So I'm very pleased with that. The second half of your question was really going to a 2-step. I don't see that happening anytime soon. We will certainly market these products to collision repair shops, but we'll continue certainly to market to that 3-step model because that's the most effective way to go to market at this point.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then one question, I guess, as it relates to North American collision. Net-net, taking out the delivery issues on the first quarter to date, are you seeing what seems to be sort of a fairly extreme weather pattern for this winter being a benefit to total the aftermarket alternative parts demand this year? Is it improving the growth rate?","Robert L. Wagman","I will take this weather over a -- 50-degree weather any day of the week. I think it's just going to be lumpy, Bret, like I said, just because so many days we couldn't deliver the parts, but I am expecting that backlog to come through.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And one last question. Do you have the most recent number on alternative parts penetration?","Robert L. Wagman","I don't. We did get an update from CCC. CCC reports that figure, the annual figure in March. However, during the year, CCC actually reported APU fluctuating between 37% and 38%. I think in June, it was at 38%. It does move depending on seasonality and supplements that hit the marketplace. We think, when the final number is in, it's obviously between -- somewhere between 37% and 38%, but it could very well round down to 37%. But we actually believe there's a reason why the number has been flat recently. And we've really discussed it in the past, but I just want to reiterate as long as we get asked the question. As you know, APU is computed and reported as dollars spent on alternative parts as a percentage of total dollars spent on all repair parts. There have been 3 major trends impacting APU recently: First, the aging carpark. LKQ, this is a pretty interesting stat, compared to 2008, we're selling on average a 2-year older model year part than we were in 2008 because of the aging carpark. Obviously, an older car part is going to command a lower part price. Second, with the recent lower-than-average sal rate [ph] that has limited the availability of recycled parts that we have even to sell. After the fall of new car production between 2008 and 2011, fewer cars reached the salvage pools and then obviously, fewer parts, and what I call our sweet spot, that 3 to 8 years, Bret. However, we think the recent improvement in the sal rate [ph] over the past 3 years should start to mitigate that trend. And we think that the average age of vehicle will start coming down, and obviously, because those -- that bigger tranche of vehicles are now starting to hit that sweet spot, there's going to be more recycle parts available. And the last drag on AP usage has been the recent surge in the sal rate [ph], interestingly enough. That's worked a little bit against us, in that brand-new cars tend to get OE parts for the first couple of years. But again, as those things start aging in the 3 to 4 years, we think that's a good trend for us. So with everything -- with all those headwinds ahead of -- in front of us, and I think most of them now behind us, we're actually pretty happy that AP usage has been stable. Interesting enough, CCC does do a report that actually shows on a per-unit basis, not on a parts dollars, but the number of units actually being written in alternative parts, and it's actually expanding, so we are continuing to take market share from the OEs on a per-unit basis. And the last thing I do want to say about AP usage is, it's an industrywide stat that CCC reports. And while it's remained flat over the past years, LKQ grew organically in our North American collision repair segments by over 6.6%. So I think it really highlights the effectiveness we've had with our direct marketing to the insurance industry and the team that heads up that for LKQ.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Rob, would you comment just a little bit, if you go back, remind us maybe history a little bit of when there's this type of availability in the marketplace at the auctions, what have you seen that variability be as far as the pricing and the ability to, as you get to a certain point in those cycle times to be able to get a better price for that car?","Robert L. Wagman","We tend to see -- it tends to follow supply and demand, John. And the supply is obviously going to be increased. We do some of our better buying in this time frame because the auctions are plentiful and we just buy a lot of cars. So I expect this will be a good buying period for LKQ with the influx of the salvage and just the sheer availability of those cars starting to come through the pipeline should bode well for our purchasing.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And you've got some -- you mentioned some backlog, but just in general, how long, if you buy the car today, just in terms of timing, how long -- that cycle time before you sell that part is roughly what?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, generally speaking, depending on the backlog we have at our operations. But from the time we buy it, bring it into our facility, we triage it, getting the fluids out, getting all the hazardous materials out, inventorying it and keeping in mind that backlog, it's 4 to 6 weeks from the time we buy it until it's actually in inventory and ready to go because we have a pretty healthy backlog as we speak right now.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And last question on Europe, though. Obviously a lot of progress with the insurance companies. What do you think the time frame is for some of these other pilots to be reviewed and decisions made?","Robert L. Wagman","I'm optimistic that in '14, we'll be bringing some of these things over the hill here, John. We've gotten really great response and, again, with 80% growth, it's worked really well for us. What has also been a powerful play for us is the paint acquisition we did there, being able to bundle options to our body-shop customers. We're very happy with the synergies that are coming along and have been achieved, and they will be achieved over the time frame we've made public to the street. And we're making progress on leveraging that distribution network as well, so we can get the products on the same trucks. Our paint NDC, we opened an NDC, a national distribution center, just for our paint products, will be fully operational by the end of March and will be servicing all the branches. And then obviously, having those nationwide delivery capabilities for our paint is allowing us to gain national accounts on the paint business. So I'm very pleased with that and expect continued growth there.","John S. Quinn","Operator, I see we're running a little over -- to just be respectful of people's time, maybe one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our final question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Back on January 16, Rob, you came out with a press release, and in there, you mentioned, you reminded us that neither the company nor its insiders can buy LKQ stock during a blackout. Once the blackout now has been lifted, can we expect to see a fair amount of insider purchases in the coming days?","Robert L. Wagman","Some of us, some of the Section 16 officers sold stock in December, and unfortunately, they're blocked out for 6 months as an SEC rule. So we won't be able to -- those who did sell in December won't be able to do anything. As far as the company itself buying back stock, I don't think that's going to happen, Sam. We think the better use of our capital is to continue our acquisition strategy. And the board has not authorized a stock purchase buyback at this time.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Are you or John restricted to buying stock in the next 6 months?","Robert L. Wagman","We both are.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so the intent, or at least -- putting words in your mouth, hopefully, I'm not doing that, but after that restriction has been lifted, assuming no material increase in the stock price, would you imagine that you would be interested in buying the stock back at these levels?","Robert L. Wagman","I would be.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last question. ECP stores, John, you mentioned the 12-month comps for stores that were open at least 12 months. Do you happen to have the growth rates of those stores that were open at least 2 or 3 years?","John S. Quinn","We have the more than 1 year and that is -- just a second, I'll look.","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, we're looking that up right now, Sam.","John S. Quinn","I thought that was in your remarks.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I think in your remarks, you said it was like either 19% or 21% growth for stores open at least 12 months. But obviously, that would be inflated by those stores that are rolling into the comp base that are only 13, 14, 15 months old. And then you've got a fair amount of those. So to get a sense of what the true organic growth of the business is on stores that have been open for at least 2 or 3 years might be helpful for us.","Robert L. Wagman","And my script was just on the last quarter, so I think you're looking for more detail.","John S. Quinn","We don't have a breakout between years, Sam. We just bifurcate it between open more than a year, which was 19% in Q4 and 21% for the full year, and then less than a year.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning. We look forward to speaking with you in April when we report our first quarter 2014 results. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q3. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance.","Turning to slide 3, Q3 revenue reached $2.39 billion, an increase of 30.3% as compared to $1.83 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $122.7 million, an increase of 21.1% as compared to $101.3 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $139.3 million, an increase of 26.8% as compared to $109.9 million for the same period of 2015.","Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 was $0.40, an increase of 21.2%, as compared to the $0.33 for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting a 25% increase over $0.36 for the same period of 2015.","During the quarter, we continued to witness the lingering effects of a mild winter and the headwinds of certain trends in the North American car park. Despite these dynamics the company delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.7%, an enviable performance compared to many companies in the global auto industry that were confronted with similar challenges and subsequently witnessed negative growth in the quarter.","Turning to our North American organic revenue growth, during the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was 2.1%, which is down from the first half of the year and below our expectations. Clearly, the macro trends in North America, such as miles driven and the size of the car park, continue to trend in our favor. But in order to grow our business, the number of collisions need to grow that will then increase the demand for our collision parts.","According to CCC, collision and liability related auto claims for the first 9 months of 2016 were up only 2.4% nationally, not far from the 2.3% increase witnessed for the first 6 months of 2016.","Furthering that point, when looking at state-level claims data from CCC, we continue to experience large regional variations. The Northeast and Midwest regions faced soft conditions, both experiencing year-over-year declines in repairable claims in certain key states. These two regions combined represent over 30% of our North American revenue.","In addition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven in the U.S. were up 3.4% in August, a measure that also witnessed significant regional differences. During August, miles driven in the Northeast and North Central regions were up only 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively.","Lastly, though difficult to quantify, we believe the surge in the SAAR rate over the last 3 years is initially a headwind, as new vehicles tend to get new collision parts. The surge also impacts our engine and transmission sales, because these type of mechanical parts are covered under manufacturer's warranty.","We also believe that the increase in vehicles in operation of model years 11 years and older has played a role in driving total loss rates above historical levels. Regardless of these short-term headwinds, we continue to believe that the car park is shifting in the right direction towards our collision sweet spot of vehicles 3 to 10 model years old. In fact, the number of vehicles in that sweet spot is expected to increase by a few percentage points in 2017.","And now turning to operations. During Q3, we purchased 70,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 1.4% decrease over Q3 2015. Procurement cost at auctions decreased over Q3 2015 by 1.9%. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 12% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter.","In our self-service retail business, during Q3 we acquired 132,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 3.1% increase over Q3 2015. Similar to the first half of the year, we increased our self-service procurement during Q3 to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher quality vehicles in this line of business.","And lastly, I am pleased with the benefits we are witnessing with our productivity initiatives. During the quarter, North America realized 60 basis points of gross margin improvement from the aftermarket procurement savings alone. And now that we are fully installed with Roadnet, our route optimization technology, we are optimistic about its potential savings.","Today, 95% of our delivery routes are actively using Roadnet. And we are already witnessing some initial cost savings per stop across 49,000 daily deliveries with 3,300 trucks. During his presentation, Nick will discuss the financial impact of these initiatives in the coming quarters.","Now moving to our European operations. In Q3, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.7% and acquisition growth of 54.6%, primarily related to the Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 10.6% related to foreign exchange rates.","During Q3, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9%. And for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.3%. During the quarter, ECP opened three new branches, bringing our network to 209 branches. During Q3, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 13.2%.","Turning to Sator. During Q3, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5.1%. This organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the ongoing three-step conversion and integration efforts we have put in place.","Now on to Rhiag. Rhiag tracked in line with our expectations during the quarter. Importantly, and as mentioned on the last call, we continue to aggressively gather the necessary data and communication plan amongst our European businesses to create a targeted and sustainable pan-European procurement function.","To highlight the opportunity, Sator had an existing agreement on a particular brand and product category that Rhiag is also buying, but at a 10% higher cost. By leveraging the Sator agreement, Rhiag has budgeted a savings of \u20ac200,000 annually, and again on one product.","Rhiag continues to execute on its growth initiatives and expand its footprint (9:23). During the quarter, the Rhiag team opened eight branches in Eastern Europe. Given the growth opportunities in the market, I am happy to announce that we have an additional 14 branches scheduled for Q4.","Now onto our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment posted a year-over-year total revenue growth of 9.9% in the quarter, including the benefits of The Coast [Distribution System] acquisition, and organic revenue growth of 3.7%. We believe the modest organic growth was related the overall specialty market facing an unfavorable mix shift, as certain key product areas witnessed model year changes.","Though still relatively high, we also faced a slight reduction in the year-over-year SAAR rate during the quarter.","Lastly, Specialty finalized the integration activities from The Coast acquisition by consolidating all of The Coast distribution centers and sales processing into our existing network.","And now an update on PGW. During the quarter, the PGW team secured another manufacturing renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch. On PGW's aftermarket business, the team continues to receive industry accolades as the supplier of choice. These accolades were validated this quarter by signing an agreement with a major customer to procure an incrementally higher volume of windshields and sidelights in 2017.","Turning to corporative development. In early October 2016, we acquired substantially all the business assets of Andrew Page Limited, a distributor of automotive parts in the United Kingdom. As part of this transaction, we acquired 102 Andrew Page branch locations. Andrew Page has a proud history of being a value-added supplier to the automotive repair industry in the UK.","With this acquisition, we believe that the transaction will benefit Andrew Page's customers with an extended range of products and a continuation of the exceptional level of service that their employees have historically provided. As we did expect, the UK Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA, commenced the review of the acquisition to assess whether the transaction would unreasonably lessen competition in the UK market.","During the CMA's review, we are not allowed to integrate the business subject to certain exceptions to allow us to support key operations. And there's always a risk that they may ask us to divest some or all of the business. Accordingly, until the CMA approves the transaction, we will not be able to achieve any of the projected synergies afforded by the integration of the combined businesses. We do anticipate the acquired business will continue to be modestly unprofitable during the review process.","In addition to the Andrew Page announcement, during the third quarter of 2016, we acquired a distributor of automotive products in the Netherlands, a distributor of recreational vehicle products and accessories in the United Kingdom, a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Ireland and a heavy-duty truck salvage yard in Minnesota.","Our acquisition strategy has always been to acquire the best assets we can with high-quality management teams and use those strengths to lever the growth of the business. As we look across our key segments, the pipeline is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow our existing market share in key markets, expand the depth of our product lines and enter new geographic markets and, in particular, throughout Europe.","At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our core segments during the third quarter before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016.","The third quarter of 2016 when taken as a whole was an excellent quarter with revenue, Segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS of 30%, 32% and 25%, respectively, when compared to the third quarter of last year. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations continue to perform well and the two big acquisitions generally performed on target. As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2016 increased 30% over last year. That reflects a 33.2% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 9.4% decrease in other revenue.","The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 3.7% from organic, plus 32.6% from acquisitions for constant currency growth of 36.4% before backing up the translation impact of FX which was a 3.2% decline.","I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. As noted on page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 190 basis points to 37.0% due primarily to the impact of the acquisitions.","You will recall that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the two big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up about 60 basis points. While the consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also down about 200 basis points lower than last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the two acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses.","Segment EBITDA totaled $274 million for the quarter, reflecting a 32% increase from 2015, and as a percent of revenue, Segment EBITDA was 11.5%, a 20-basis-point improvement over the 11.3% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $3.8 million increase in restructuring costs related to the integration of our acquisitions.","Depreciation and amortization was up about $26 million, mostly related to the addition of Rhiag and PGW. The same holds true for interest expense which was up about $12 million. And with that, pre-tax income increased 16% in the quarter relative to last year. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.7%, down from the 33.9% recorded in 2015. This lower rate reflects an ongoing rate of 34.75% and a $5 million benefit associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09 which tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.","All companies need to adopt this new accounting standard by the first quarter of 2017, and we elected to adopt early. We have excluded this benefit from our adjusted EPS calculation in order to provide an apples-to-apples comparison.","Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.40, which was up 21% compared to last year. Adjusted EPS, again, excluding restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and the discrete tax benefit just mentioned, was $0.45 versus $0.36, reflecting a 25% improvement. Scrap had a small negative impact on earnings per share for the quarter, about $0.005, and currency fluctuations negatively impacted EPS growth by about $0.01 as well.","As highlighted on page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this revenue mix shift impacts the trends in consolidated margins. This has become more accentuated with our ownership of both Rhiag and PGW. And you saw a shift in the third quarter metrics where in North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of total consolidated revenue.","And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Total revenue in our North American segment during the third quarter of 2016 increased to $1.047 billion or about 1% over 2015. This is the combination of a 2.3% growth rate in parts and services offset by a 9.5% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to lower volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower prices received for a variety of metals.","When looking at the North American growth, it's important to recognize that there were variations across the platform. As Rob mentioned, there were geographic differences with the Central and West regions performing much better than the Northeast and Midwest regions.","Recycling grew at a faster rate than aftermarket, and even within aftermarket, certain car types like the core Keystone fenders, hoods, and lights grew faster than some other products related to cooling or aluminum wheels. So, there were spots of strength and spots of weakness.","Gross margins in North America during the third quarter of 2016 were 43.8%, a 160 basis point increase over last year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relate to the aftermarket operations, and the benefits of the procurement initiatives accounted for approximately 50 basis points of the 90 basis point improvement. Our salvage and Self Service operations contributed 70 basis points of increase to the North American gross margins. You will note that while scrap averaged $118 a ton during Q3, in October, scrap has rolled back down to slightly below $100 a ton.","With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost about 50 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2015. On the upside, we continued to experience improvements in both fuel and facilities cost relative to last year. On the downside, we lost a bit of margin in personnel cost and freight expense.","In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the third quarter of 2016 was $141 million. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.5% in Q3 of 2016, an increase of 110 basis points from the 12.4% reported in the comparable period of last year.","Last call, we indicated that we expected the benefit of our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move throughout the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefit in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings in connection with our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in other expense categories across North America.","In total, we estimate the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the third quarter was approximately $8.6 million, up from the $5 million reported in Q2 or a little bit less than $0.02 a share.","Moving on to our European segment, the total revenue in the third quarter accelerated to $770 million from $511 million, a 51% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the third quarter was 6.7%, reflecting the combination of 6.9% growth at ECP and 5.1% growth at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 55% increase in revenue with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So, on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 61%. These constant currency increases were offset by an 11% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling.","As you can see on page 19, the average rate during the quarter was about 15% below last year, and the sterling was at $1.30 (sic) [$1.31] (22:54) at [ph] quarter end (22:55). More recently, the sterling has fallen a further 7%, down to $1.22. And the euro is also down about 3% to $1.09 (sic) [$1.08] (23:10). The translation impact of these latest drops will weigh on our reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year, probably to the tune of about $0.01 in the fourth quarter.","Gross margins in Europe were 36.2%, a 210 basis point decline from the comparable period of last year, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. As mentioned in prior calls, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. During Q3, Rhiag had a gross margin of about 33.5%, which reduced the consolidated European gross margin by about 150 basis points.","Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to ECP, which experienced an increase in customer rebates, and the impact of some of the incremental costs of the new distribution facility in Tamworth rolling through cost of goods sold.","With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 150 basis point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from a 240 basis point reduction in operating expenses due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than ECP or Sator. Offsetting these gains was an 80 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense, reflecting some of the cost of the Tamworth facility as well as new branches and hubs at ECP. In addition, we lost about 30 basis points of margin in the U.K. related to the impact of translation losses on inventory purchases, which are denominated in a foreign currency.","With respect to the Tamworth project, the incremental costs related to this project in the third quarter were approximately \u00a32 million or about $2.6 million. Again, some of this was recorded in cost of goods sold and some in SG&A. In total it reflects a 30 basis point impact on European margins.","European EBITDA totaled $73 million, a 38% increase over last year, reflecting a solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of real. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA margins in the third quarter were 9.4% versus 10.3% last year, a 90 basis point decline, again 30 basis points of which relate to the Tamworth project.","Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the third quarter totaled $313 million, a 10% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. The organic growth rate was 3.7%, while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 6.2% to revenue growth. In the last couple of calls, we indicated that the high level of organic growth in Specialty was not sustainable, and overall, we were happy with the third quarter growth rate.","Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the third quarter were flat compared to last year, as the impact of stocking two new specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State, which were not in operation at this time last year, was offset by an increase in advertising credits.","Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 100 basis points. Facility expense increased, as certain costs related to the two new distribution centers just mentioned. But on the plus side, we continue to see SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices.","EBITDA for Specialty was $32 million in the quarter, up 24% from the third quarter of last year. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 120 basis points to 10.4% in 2016, compared to 9.2% last year. Remember this is a highly seasonal business, and you should assume these margins will decline as we move through the historically soft Q4 period.","On page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $259 million, while gross margins in Q3 were 22.6%, which is very consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 10.7% in the third quarter.","Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 9 months was approximately $524 million, as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase on working capital.","During the first 9 months of 2016, we deployed a little bit more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $153 million to fund capital expenditures and about $1.8 billion to acquire businesses.","We closed the quarter with approximately $272 million of cash, of which $226 million was held outside of the U.S. And we had roughly $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our net leverage was a little bit less than 2.7 times latest 12 months EBITDA. At quarter-end the total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.2 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the continued growth of our business.","Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we reduced the organic growth guidance for full year 2016 to 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the 5.1% rate for the first 9 months, and an expectation that we don't anticipate any major movements during the fourth quarter.","For those trying to back into the Q4 growth, the range implies a 2.6% to 4.6% growth rate. But it is important to note that there is one less business day in Q4 of 2016 than Q4 of 2015, and while that may sound trivial, it's a 1.5% fewer business days compared to last year. Customers don't buy more on other days to make up the difference, so the calendar simply puts us in a 1.5% hole to start. In addition, the hurricane earlier this month closed some of our operations and some of our customers' operations in Florida and the Carolinas for a couple of days.","Our range for adjusted EPS which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization and the tax benefit of adopting ASU 2016-09 is $1.78 to $1.84 per share with a midpoint of $1.81. As in the past, we have narrowed the range to reflect the fact that we are nine months through the year. The new range reflects the fact that Q3 results were right on track, and the outlook for the core business for the rest of the year is largely unchanged, except for the anticipated headwinds from currencies, lower scrap prices, and the dilutive impact of owning Andrew Page as a completely independent company without the ability to integrate operations.","To be clear, the new EPS guidance assumes pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.22 and $1.09, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at the current levels as well. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%, excluding the benefit of adopting the new accounting pronouncement. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations also narrowed a bit to approximately $575 million to $600 million, and the guidance for capital spending is unchanged at $200 million to $225 million.","At this point in time, I'll turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Nick. As a company, we are always focused on financial performance, but we are equally focused on facing change head on and rapidly adapting in order to continuously deliver positive results for our stockholders, employees, and most importantly, our customers. There is no question that weather impacted various lines of business and many markets for our companies thus far in 2016, a similar scenario to what we witnessed in 2012.","We firmly believe that like 2012, this impact is temporary and that the macro trends continue to present opportunities for all of our segments. Yet we don't rest on our laurels and simply blame softness in our business on uncontrollable circumstances. Rather, during those periods, we strive to maintain our historical growth rates and our leading positions by focusing on what we can control such as the margin improvements we recognized in this quarter.","It is clear as headwinds present themselves, our team of nearly 41,000 employees globally actively adjust to market conditions to effectively and profitably manage their businesses not only for today but to position us well for the future. This focus allowed us again to deliver double-digit EPS growth in the midst of a challenging environment. So, a big thank you to the LKQ team.","And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","You talked about some of the performance disparity in the CCC numbers across geography persisting into 3Q. That's a little bit surprising I guess with the thought that maybe the impact from weather would be less substantial in 3Q across the markets. Maybe your thoughts as to why there's that disparity still in 3Q despite what I would think would be a little bit less impacted.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Ben. We certainly look into that with CCC and with some of our customers. And what we find is that the vast majority in collisions are drivable collisions. So, they do tend to take time to get repaired when the customer is ready to get the car into the shop. So, it does tend to drag on through the entire year actually with the drivable collisions. And then you look at just the overall claims volume being up just 2.4% for the whole year. There is just been a light amount of claims being filed this year. It's just been a really soft year that has carried through all through Q3.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Ben, this is Nick. Think about the map of the United States. I'm going to give you some names of the states where claim volume was down year-over-year: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The only big states missing there in that swath are New Jersey and Illinois. New Jersey was up 0.5% and Illinois was up 0.2%. So, that whole Northeast and Midwest section of the country just has lower claim volumes.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","One other area too, Ben, that we saw was weak was Western Canada, the decimation of the fracking industry up there. Our claim volume is down, way down there as well, as well as our business. So, it's not just weather. It's some economic conditions as well.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Interesting. That's really helpful color. Thanks. And then shifting gears to the Andrew Page business, it looks like from some of the numbers that we've looked at, actually the sales productivity per store is pretty good, but it sounds like maybe operationally that they're underperforming and not particularly profitable stores. Just curious as to what best practices you can bring there to that business to improve the profitability of the stores and then ultimately, what you think the contribution could be from that chunk of stores.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Sure. Unfortunately, under a whole separate world, we were not allowed to integrate the businesses. But we do believe purchasing will be the biggest benefit. We tend to buy a little bit better than they do. We are, under the whole separate world, allowed to sell to each other, so we are supporting the business today. But until we can fully integrate the business -- when we do integrate the business, it will be logistics. We believe we have a much \u2013 with Tamworth 2 coming online, we're going to be able to much better support those businesses with inventory and deliveries, which we think will make a huge operational benefit for those stores that they have.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, just to be clear, Ben, that business was sold. It basically went into receivership, and we bought it basically through a prepackaged bankruptcy process to give you the U.S. analogy, if you will. So, obviously, the performance of the business was headed down by the time we got the assets. We do think there is an ability, by adequately stocking their warehouses and their stores, to actually drive revenue back north to where it was pre their financial issues .","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","And just one last update on the CMA. We are close to filing our submission to the CMA. They have up to two months to decide what the next steps are. So, when we get released, we'll be ready to start integrating the business hopefully by Q1.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is now open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. I wanted to probe the North American business a little further. Could you explain how much of that business is tied to collision trends versus mechanical trends?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","So, the salvage business or the recycling business, Craig, is roughly a 50\/50 split. The aftermarket business is almost wholly collision-focused. So, when you look at it in its entirety, out of our total revenue on a consolidated global basis, slightly less than 30% of our revenue is collision-based.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful. And then, Rob, you mentioned a statistic from CCC that claim volume is up only 2.4%. That sounds like a decent number. Could you give some context to that? What was that figure in the full year of 2015, for example?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","We'll get that. We're looking for that right now, Craig. I just want to state that I know in 2012, we had very similar results to what we're seeing this year. In 2013, it did bounce back. And we believe just some of those macro trends that we're seeing, new car sales are definitely a little bit of a headwind at first, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Those are starting to come out of warranty, so we do expect some help there. We did mention on the call the increase in total losses. The good news there is that CCC is anticipating that those start to level off now because of the newer car part getting into the system. And then of course, the regional segmentation that we're seeing. As Nick mentioned, the Northeast and the Midwest, just really getting decimated by claim volume. So, we are hoping for a normal winter, and we do expect it to obviously bounce right back.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And as you look for that number, if I could just slip in a quick question on Europe and the margin there. I know it's under pressure due to the mix of some of the new businesses you've acquired, but where do you think that margin can settle over time at the gross margin level as you extract purchasing synergies? And thank you.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, we were at 36.2% in the quarter. Last quarter, we're at 37.4%. Some of that is just seasonal differences, Craig. So, gross margins, you figure \u2013 with the addition of Rhiag, I think I mentioned in my comments, Rhiag was at around 33.5% gross margin, so that's what's pulling it down from historical levels. We would hope to get a 1% or 2% from procurement over time. That's a hard process. The vendors are not anxious to just give us big discounts. But we're working at it very hard. John and his team over in London, they've got a dedicated group that's focused on nothing but trying to execute a pan-European procurement program.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","And, Craig, on the number you're looking for, we'll circle back with you. We need to get in touch with CCC on that.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from James (sic) [Jamie] (41:09) Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.","Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thank you and good morning, gentlemen.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Good morning.","Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Wanted to ask just as a point of reference, I know you are a few months, maybe a quarter or two out from the CMA process kind of fulfilling its duties, but if we were to look at prior integration of something like Unipart would that be a good proxy for us to think about with respect to dilution initially and then sort of the opportunity over time with Andrew Page?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Andrew Page, we've got actually earlier in the process by the time that Unipart kind of went out the stores or basically vacant. Andrew Page, its stores were ongoing. We have inventory, depleted inventory but inventory in the stores which we're rebuilding and the like.","So, we do think, however, that we will be able to get Andrew Page back to profitability. It's probably going to make us for $0.01 to $0.015 in the fourth quarter. And so, we would look in 2017 once we are able to kind of fully work with their team, get their customer service levels where they need to be particularly the fulfillment levels and inventories back at the right levels. We can grow revenue and that will help the profitability as well. We'll take some cost savings just related to procurement, some back-office stuff, maybe a little bit on the logistics, but we do think we can drive it back into profitability, which will, obviously, help the overall margins.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, Jamie, unfortunately, with the hold separate (42:54), we can't really dig into the locations at this point. So, initially, our focus will be on purchasing, logistics, and the back-office functions.","Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then a quick question, if I may, on Pittsburgh Glass. Congratulations on the new customer you signed up on the aftermarket side. I just want to understand sort of what that can do to your margin if we kind of look forward, just sort of maybe asking for reminder on the OE versus aftermarket contribution to gross margin.","And then a point of clarification, we understand that PGW is your only business exposure to OEMs directly. Is that true or is there another business channel or subchannel that we're missing with respect to OEs directly? Thanks.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","I'll answer that question and let Nick take the margin question, Jamie. It is the one exposed to OE the most. We have a little bit of exposure on the KAO side, the accessories side, because we do see that as new car sales are up, we do well on the accessory side. But it's sort of a secondary issue there. But the OE business is the only one that has true cyclicality to the OE production.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Jamie, this is Nick. As you can imagine, the gross margin profiles of the aftermarket business and the OE business are very different. Operating costs are as well, since there's no real distribution and selling expense related to the OE business. But order of magnitude, the ARG gross margins are well north of 30%, where the OE margins are in the mid-teens.","Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Great. So this sounds like it'll be a mixed benefit, based on the fact that you're adding that aftermarket customer if I heard you correctly.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Exactly.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Correct.","Jamie Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Perfect. Thank you so much and best of luck.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Rob. Good morning, Nick. How are you?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Good, Sam.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Nick, if you had this in your prepared remarks and I missed it, I apologize. Within your North American parts and services organic growth, the 2.1%, can you parse out volumes versus price mix in that?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, we got benefit from both. The pricing was slightly more than the volume impact. That doesn't mean we were necessarily increasing prices across the board, Sam. As I mentioned I think last quarter, a good portion of the price increase comes from just selling a newer part and the mix shift as to what parts we're selling. And so it may come across and looking like we're taking prices up, but it just has to do with that we're selling a slightly more expensive part. But again slightly more than half of the growth was price related.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Two more quick questions. And I guess one of them is more critical than the other. The first would be, I mean with the increase in total losses \u2013 I recognize that it's a smaller percentage of the overall claims versus repairable claims. But with the increase in total losses, does that have the threat of either overwhelming or offsetting the advantages you have with the SAAR sweet spot over the next few years?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","I don't think so, Sam. I don't think \u2013 we like total losses because that's where we get our inventory from as well. So there's still 82% of the cars that are in accidents are getting repaired. So I see that as a wash actually. Although fewer cars are being repaired, but they tend to be older cars is what CCC is telling us. So they are totaling an older car, which makes sense because the average model year is up to 11.5 model years old.","But the SAAR rate is much more important to us, getting new cars into the system, because the new car is going to be fully insured. And that's why I'm pretty bullish on 2017. We're getting these 1- to 3-year cars out of warranty into our sweet spot. So we'd like to see a strong SAAR rate by far.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Last quick question. Obviously, Germany made some news with respect to the resolution, trying to ban combustion engine production over time. I know it's a long-tailed item and it's far from even being industry standard, but how does that affect your business longer term, Rob, if it does become kind of the world we live in?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","If there's a shift to electric vehicles, that's a little bit more of a problem. If it's going to be more diesel, that's actually a positive. Diesel engines sell for far more than what we get for a gas engine actually, so depending on where it goes.","I was actually in China last week, and they're having similar initiatives over there as well. But nobody seemed concerned about it, the people we talked to. So it's a long tail as you said.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you both, gentlemen. I appreciate it.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Morning, Nate.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Hey, Nate.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","So wanted to talk just \u2013 I hate to harp on the North American issues a little bit. But, one, just wondering if you had any thoughts in terms of the fact that the miles driven were up, but the claims were less in terms of being up. I get the disparity across regions and what not, but usually, those have a little bit of a tighter correlation in terms of why those claims wouldn't follow directly with the miles driven.","And then second part of that in terms of going in next year, obviously, Rob, you've been very bullish in terms of, hey, assuming a normal winter, we have easy comps or easier comps. In theory we should be back to that 5% to 7% North American parts and service organic growth range.","Is there anything underlying the surface? Assuming again a normal winter and things kind of go back like they did in 2013, anything underlying the surface that you would think would be such a substantial headwind where we wouldn't get there?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Nate, when I look at some of the normal weather conditions, as I said, we're getting cars starting to come into that sweet spot. There's a lot of macro good tailwinds for us in terms of miles driven. The late model car park for our KAO business, normal winter will certainly spur our glass business as well.","I don't see any major headwinds that could impact that other than another mild winter. And on top of easy comps, as you said. It just feels like there's enough positive tailwinds behind us that are going to make 2017 look like 2013.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And I haven't heard of anything, but no underlying shifts or anything that we might not be seeing that your customers are saying in terms of something going on that we wouldn't be thinking of?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","The only thing that we've heard from our customers interestingly enough is that they're having a hard time hiring technicians. And just getting the work out the door has been a little bit of a challenge for that side of the business, but that they will fix. They will find people to fix the cars. I'm absolutely convinced of that. So, no, nothing underlying that we're hearing from our customer base whatsoever.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, two, you talked about obviously controlling what you can on the margin side, and kudos for delivering that. And it still feels that we're kind of in the relative early innings in terms of seeing the results as you pointed out mix sequentially, so that continues to go well. Anything else on the top line though that you can do to help your cause in terms of whether it's trying to buy more cars or we talked before about getting into the transmission remanufacturing business or anything on the incremental side of trying to just push incrementally on the sales effort?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Absolutely. We did mention that we've been trying to buy a better car in anticipation of these newer cars coming into the sweet spot. So, we will be pushing more cars through the system, absolutely. That is our goal. We're in the process of acquiring more property wherever we can to process more vehicles, so that is absolutely a focus as well as introducing new product types. We talked about the number of certified parts continue to go up. We're carrying a much stronger level of those parts as well. So, I think our inventory is going to be well positioned to meet the organic growth needs that we have.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just last question, Rob, just because you brought it up in terms of hiring technicians. Is there anything going on in the surface, underlying again in the surface where the cars are becoming so complex and the diagnostics so complex that any worry even past the warranty period that more cars, whether it's a collision or a mechanical repair would be going back to the dealer for some reason?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","We don't think so. I've talked to honestly the MSOs quite regularly on their thoughts on that, and they don't believe that technology is not insurmountable for a technician not trained in a dealership environment. So, they are confident, as you can see, by their acquisitions. They continue to acquire companies. They think they're well positioned to be able to handle those repairs. More importantly, I think, is our manufacturers' ability to replicate those parts over in Taiwan, and they're seeing no issues whatsoever acquiring the correct aluminum or the high-strength steel. So, no issues on either side.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","And, Nate, one other thing is even if there were more cars headed into dealer collision repair shops, that doesn't mean that there is more OE parts because the insurance companies are still mandating which parts are going to be used. Just the week before last, I was \u2013 spent the day with customers out in the field, including dealers, and they basically have said that they don't have the ability to select the parts being used. The insurance companies are driving it all. So, it doesn't make a difference where the repair is being held and done. The choice of parts selection is still being driven by the insurance companies.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Outstanding point. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Nate.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Hey, Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Question. I guess you've given the CCC number on repairable claims growth year-to-date of 2.4%. What's the total claim so we can factor in the losses? Because obviously, some of the salvage auction guys are seeing more volume flowing through theirs. Insurance companies opt not to repair, but what's the total crash rate?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","It's about 6%, which includes comp, which are flood losses, tornadoes. So, yeah, the auctions are getting that benefit. Those are cars that don't get repaired because of the floods and hail damage, severe hail damage that totals a car.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then I guess on Andrew Page, 102 stores, assuming it's finally approved. How many of those you think you need to close? Is there a lot of duplicate real estate there with ECP?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","No. There is, however, they've got a unique customer base. So, we're going to look at that on an individual basis, but as it stands right now, we plan at keeping the vast majority open because they have service to different customer to a certain extent, and the brand is so strong. We'll look at that post CMA clearance.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then one last question on Specialty. I think you said you were pretty happy with the 3.7% growth. Where do you see that being? And I guess, when you acquired the original Keystone, it was sort of seen as growing in line with the core North American business at the time. I guess, now that we've owned it for a couple of years, is it something that you think is a lower single-digit grower or is it the change in the mix as you've bought Stag and Coast that has brought the growth down into the low to mid single as opposed to mid to upper single?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","True to the three quarters, we're actually above the North American growth, and I think that's going to continue, Bret. I think that the volume continues to be strong. The RV sales are up year-over-year. So, as long as that continues, we do expect decent organic growth in that line of business.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, for the first nine months, the organic growth in Specialty was 7.3%.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Right.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And I guess, from the competitive landscape in Specialty, do you see anything changing? Obviously, Amazon is talking about auto parts these days, our favorite topic recently. And Specialty and performance is a category they are focusing on. Do you see any change? Are they making inroads or is it pretty much status quo from your customer base?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, status quo. Amazon, these are big bulky parts, as you know. They have not shown any desire at this point to stock a lot of that product. So, at this point, our customer base is still very strong, coming direct to us.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Bret.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Armstrong with C.L. King. Your line is now open.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen. On the North American 2.1% growth, are you seeing any disparity or divergence between mechanical versus collision repair?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","As Nick mentioned in his prepared remarks, our core parts business did well. Where we saw a little bit of softness, Bill, was in the wheel business and the collision cooling business and obviously, a little bit of paint that's tied to the collision itself. Soothe mechanical side of the business did okay and the salvage side of the business.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then your Q4 guidance or the implied Q4 guidance, you mentioned your foreign exchange assumptions of $1.22. What would be the cents per share impact of that lower foreign exchange?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, Bill. Thanks for asking the question. The FX is likely going to hit us for $0.01, maybe slightly more than $0.01. We think that scrap is going to hit us for at least $0.005, maybe a little bit more. As I mentioned, Andrew Page will likely hit us for close to a $0.015, and that's really the sum and substance of the slight tweaks to the guidance.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","And your last question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a question again on North America. Have you seen any change for OEM price matching or any other change in the competitive landscape?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","No, not at all, Jason. The OEs are still doing the same things they've done and haven't increased their price matching programs whatsoever. It's interesting on the \u2013 you can talk about competition. We are obviously active acquirers in the business, and we obviously get to see financials, and we're seeing the industry struggle. They don't seem to be taking market share from anybody, our competition, so from the financials we've seen.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","You mentioned weather. I mean, is this more of a function of the economy, just customers not repairing their cars, as you say, drivable collisions?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","That's definitely a part of it. There is certainly some economic uncertainty out there with the elections going on. That's for sure. Yes, when the car is drivable, the consumer can elect to pocket that check that they get from their insurance company. It is interesting when we've done our channel checks on that, Jason. The insurance companies never know if the car actually got repaired. It's pretty interesting. When they write a check to a third party, that customer can repair the car or obviously take the money. They would not know unless there was a supplement. In other words, they wrote an estimate for $1,000, ship said they need $1,200, then they would know obviously because they have to write an additional check, but the vast majority of the time, the insurance company doesn't even know if the car got repaired.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Okay. And then finally, just looking at the collision revenue number in the U.K., up 13%, which is still strong but maybe off a little from historical growth rates. Just wondered if you could talk about that business and your efforts to increase benefits there?","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, still very pleased with our collision growth there, double digits. They too had a mild winter, and it's also been similar to the United States, an influx of new car. Registrations are up dramatically in the UK, so they're getting a little bit of headwind from the new car, again, that it tends to get new parts. They are also coming out of that in the next year, so we do expect the tailwind to start to emerge with the car part getting a little more in the sweet spot. So, same number of insurance companies in our program, very consistently happy with the results we've been delivering, and no one has been turning their backs on us in terms of stopping the program.","So, we are starting our initial \u2013 just an update on the continent. We've talked about bringing the collision parts to the continent. We are just starting our initial talks with some of the Netherlands insurance companies to start bringing collision parts into that market as well. So, we anticipate 2017 being a launching of that program as well.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","And before we wrap up the call, I just want to make one thing clear because there was some analyst who put out notes this morning before the call with the implication that the change on the accounting standard, the benefit of lower tax rates got rolled into our adjusted EPS. That's incorrect.","Adjusted EPS of $0.45 excludes the benefit, excludes the benefit of the adoption of the new accounting standard. So, if we had let it just roll through, we would have reported $0.47. Likewise, our guidance for the year excludes the benefit of the new accounting standard.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the conference back to Rob Wagman for closing remarks.","Robert L. Wagman - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We look forward to updating you on our Q4 results and the 2017 guidance on our next call in February. Have a good day, everybody. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Boutross. You may begin.","Joseph P. Boutross - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Devon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Rob Wagman and Nick Zarcone. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for the call.","Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor.

Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release as well as the slide presentation.","And, with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased with the results we reported this morning. And before I provide an update on our operations, let me briefly highlight a few key financial metrics from the quarter.","Turning to slide three, Q3 revenue reached $1.83 billion, an increase of 6.4% as compared to $1.72 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Net income for the third quarter of 2015 was $101.3 million, an increase of 10.7% as compared to $91.5 million for the same period of 2014.","Diluted earnings per share of $0.33 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015, increased 10% from $0.30 for the third quarter of 2014. Please note that adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2015 would have been $0.34 compared to $0.31 for the third quarter of 2014 after adjusting each of the periods for net losses resulting from restructuring and acquisition related expenses and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.","Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.8% for the quarter. And on a constant currency basis, total growth for parts and services was 14.9%. I am particularly pleased with our EPS performance, given the effect from FX and soft scrap steel prices, which, combined, negatively impacted the year-over-year change in EPS by $0.02.","On a nine-month year-to-date basis, revenue was $5.44 billion, an increase of 7.7% from $5.1 billion for the comparable period of 2014. Parts and services organic revenue growth for the first nine months of 2015 was 7.3%. Net income for the first nine months of 2015 was $328.2 million as compared to $301.1 million for the first nine months of 2014. Diluted earnings per share was $1.07 for the first nine months of 2015 as compared to $0.98 for the comparable period of 2014. On an adjusted basis, year-to-date 2015 EPS was $1.10 versus $1.01 for the last year.","Now a brief update on our operations, which are highlighted on slide six and seven. During the quarter, our North American operations continued to benefit from various macro trends. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven was up 4.2% in July, the latest reported figures available. This number represents the 17th consecutive month of increases in miles driven. With low gas prices and ongoing improvements in unemployment rate, we expect a continuation of this trend.","Though initially a headwind, as newer vehicles requiring repair tend to receive new OE parts, the increase in the SAAR rate presents attractive growth prospects for alternative products as these vehicles age. The SAAR rate for Q3 2015 was 17.8 million units compared to 16.8 million units for Q3 2014, a 6.1% increase year-over-year. Simply put, increased new vehicle sales increased the size of the car park, which equates to more insured cars on the road, the likelihood of increased accidents and more repairs. These trends help drive North American organic growth for parts and services of 5.9% in Q3.","During Q3, we purchased 71,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operation, which is a 1.4% decrease compared to Q3 2014. This reduction was a result of a healthy backlog of vehicles from the first half of 2015. During Q3, our pricing at auction was again flat year-over-year, but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over a half a year when compared to 2014. This younger vehicle procurement strategy continues to perform well as witnessed by the positive 30 basis point contribution year-over-year to our North American gross margins.","Also, our North American aftermarket parts business witnessed a robust increase in the number of available certified parts in Q3. On a year-over-year basis, the number of certified SKUs increased 34%. This trend bodes well as the vehicles from the recent surge in the SAAR rate begin to move into our sweet spot of vehicles in the three-year to nine-year range, again, an ideal age range for alternative part usage.","During Q3, our self-service retail business acquired 128,000 lower cost, self-service and crush-only cars as compared to 134,000 in Q3 of 2014 or a 4.5% decrease. Self-service faced some headwinds during the quarter, primarily centered on lower scrap pricing, which Nick will address shortly.","And, lastly on North America, I want to provide a brief update on AlixPartners, the global business consulting and advisory firm we partnered with in Q2 to begin assisting us with identifying potential operational efficiencies within four key areas: parts procurement, route optimization, dismantling centers of excellence and sales force effectiveness. We have identified several significant opportunities in each of these key areas. However, I want to highlight an example with the sales force effectiveness test that we launched in Q3 at our Florida locations.","The intent with this test was to create a defined sales and operations structure in Florida to enable a greater focus on improving the customer experience, while simultaneously developing high levels of productivity. For example, in order to gain efficiencies within our sales effort, we began leveraging a centralized phone system that is networked throughout the entire state. This system creates a seamless flow of calls between facilities, which reduces the time our customers wait for the next available representative and the risk of a lost sale.","In addition, to drive increased sales productivity, we've established key performance indicators or KPIs. KPIs are primarily focused around maximizing total clock time and outbound call levels and coaching time, which is the time inside sales managers spend developing the effectiveness of our sales representatives. Though early in this initiative, we're quickly witnessing a reduction in personnel overlap, which has resulted in positive cost savings thus far.","Now moving to our European operations. In Q3, our Wholesale European segment had organic revenue growth of 7.2% and acquisition growth of 5.7%, which was offset by a decrease of 9.9% related to foreign exchange rates. ECP's continued positive performance drove organic revenue growth up 10.1% in the quarter. And for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 6.2%. During the quarter, ECP opened four additional branches, bringing our UK network to 198 with four additional branches scheduled to open in Q4.","During Q3, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 34%. ECP continues to execute on growing the collision business. And through the end of Q3, ECP operates 14 collision parts distribution centers dedicated to supporting the collision sales of their branch network. The targeted number of collision parts distribution centers necessary to cover the UK is 20. And we expect this to be completed by the second half of 2016.","And, lastly, on ECP, I'd like to provide a brief update on our new 750,000 square foot national distribution warehouse, currently under development in the UK. This large project is currently on-time and on-budget. At this point, the shell of the warehouse is fully complete. And we're now planning the next phase, which is primarily focused on internal equipment infrastructure and the launching of the automation and logistical build out. For the quarter, we did not incur any material costs related to this project.","Turning to Sator business. During the quarter, Sator witnessed additional gross margin benefit year-over-year, which contributed to a positive 260 basis point year-over-year improvement to our European gross margins. Also, during the quarter, Sator acquired four additional distributors of aftermarket automotive products in the Netherlands. These acquisitions largely completed our efforts of converting a portion of Sator's network to a two-step model and achieve our goal of operating over 80 branches of the market. Once fully integrated, this branch network should strengthen Sator's long-term prospects and margin profile and position the business well for our expected entry into the alternative collision parts market in the Benelux region, which we anticipate launching in 2016.","Now onto the Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year revenue growth of 41% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Stag Parkway and Coast acquisitions and strong organic revenue growth of 10%. During the quarter, all integration activities from the October 2014 Stag acquisition were completed. In total, our Specialty team integrated 12 Stag warehouses into six existing KAO distribution centers, an impressive accomplishment in just one year.","In addition, during Q3, our Specialty team opened a new 360,000 square foot warehouse in Michigan. This warehouse will provide improved inventory availability and service levels for our customers in the Great Lakes and Midwest regions. We're scheduled to begin receiving inventory at this warehouse mid-Q4 and begin distributing products early Q1 2016.","And, lastly, on operations, in addition to the Netherlands distributors, during the quarter, our corporate development efforts included the closing of the previously announced acquisitions of Parts Channel, The Coast Distribution System and eight self-service yards in California from Ecology Auto Parts.","At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on the financial results of the quarter.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. Over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our three segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance.","For those of you who accessed our earnings presentation on the website, you will notice that we have included detail on both the third quarter ended September 30 and the first nine months of 2015. My comments will generally follow the flow of the presentation. But to be concise, I will focus on the quarterly results.","The short version of our financial performance in the third quarter of 2015 would be that save for our self-service operation, we had a great quarter. We experienced solid revenue growth despite continued headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar. And except for our self-service operations, each of our businesses drove solid margin increases relative to the third quarter of 2014.","As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $1.83 billion, representing a 6.4% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.7% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 30.8% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals, which I will address in a few minutes.","The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.8% from organic, 8.1% from acquisitions, before backing out 4.2% for the translation impact of FX. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results.","As noted on slide 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 30 basis points to 38.9% in the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately 70 basis points of improvement from operations, offset by 40 basis points of decline due to the revenue mix as the revenue growth of our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, outpaced that of our other operations.","We lost about 10 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our self-service operations. This operation experienced a meaningful decline in revenue related to the lower scrap steel prices and an uptick in expenses, the combination of which resulted in materially higher cost as a percent of revenue in each expense category. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution costs as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation.","Segment EBITDA totaled $207 million for the quarter, reflecting an 8.2% increase from 2014. And, as a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.3%, a 20 basis point increase over the 11.1% recorded last year. The increase in EBITDA, when combined with the lower relative levels of depreciation, amortization and interest expense, allows pre-tax income to increase by 10.8% during the third quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year and the pre-tax margins expanded by 40 basis points from 8.1% to 8.5%.","Our tax rate during the third quarter was down to 33.9% as compared to 34.0% in 2014. The tax rate reflects an effective rate of 34.75% for the quarter as well as a favorable adjustment to get us to that level on a year-to-date basis as we have been estimating an effective tax rate of 35.1%. As Rob mentioned, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 a share compared to $0.30 last year, a 10% increase. And adjusted EPS was $0.34 a share compared to $0.31, again, approximately 10% improvement.","As highlighted on slide 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since all of our segments have different margin structures, this mix shift does impact the trend in consolidated margins. And, with that, let's get into the details on the segments.","Revenue in our North American segment during the third quarter of 2015 increased to $1,037 million or about 1% over last year. This is a combination of a 7.9% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 31.1% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. Organic growth in the North American parts and services was 5.9%, reflecting a 6.5% increase in the core recycling and aftermarket activities being offset by minimal revenue growth from part sales in our self-service business. All in all, this was a very solid quarter for our North American operations.","Gross margins in North America during the third quarter increased 30 basis points relative to the comparable period of the prior year from 41.9% to 42.2%. This increase was primarily due to our improved procurement in our salvage operations and a mix shift away from self-service, which has lower gross margins than our Wholesale operations.","With respect to operating expense in North American, we lost about 80 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2014. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year as diesel averaged $2.63 a gallon as compared to $3.84. As a percent of revenue, fuel costs declined by 40 basis points while we experienced some modest increases in facilities and SG&A expenses, resulting in an overall 10 basis point reduction in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our Wholesale business.","Unfortunately, the improvement in Wholesale was more than offset by our self-serve unit, which experienced a slight increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue due both to the significant decline in scrap prices and a modest reduction in the number of cars processed. As a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue of our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis.","And while self-service only represents a little bit less than 9% of total North American revenue, this large increase had a 90 basis point negative impact on the total operating expenses as a percent of revenue for North America. So we were up 10 basis points due to Wholesale, down 90 basis points due self-serve for a negative impact of 80 basis points.","Slide 16 takes a closer look at the scrap steel prices over the past 21 months. You will note that the average price we realized in the third quarter of 2015 was approximately $123 a ton. We're down 43% compared to last year. In total, the lower pricing for scrap steel reduced our revenue for the quarter by approximately $29 million on a year-over-year basis.","It is important to note that while we ended the quarter at approximately $109 per ton for scrap steel, the prices we have been receiving recently have fallen further. So we expect additional pressure in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline in scrap steel prices had approximately a $0.02 negative impact on our earnings per share during the third quarter.","While we have been dealing with falling scrap steel prices for a while, during Q3, we also experienced a material decline in the prices received from other metals that are a residual of our recycling activities, including aluminum, copper, platinum, palladium and rhodium, which were down materially compared to the third quarter of last year. So while revenue from scrap steel was down $29 million during the quarter, revenue derived from selling aluminum, precious metals and catalytic converters was down an incremental $17 million compared to Q3 of last year.","In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the third quarter of 2015 was $129 million, reflecting a 2.5% decline compared to last year. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 12.4% in Q3 of 2015, a 50 basis point decline over the comparable period the prior year.","In both, dollar and percentage terms, the Wholesale operations improved relative to the comparable period of the prior year. But the overall segment results were down as a result of the decline at our self-service operations, again, with the latter largely reflecting the impact of lower scrap and other metal prices.","Moving on to our European segment, total revenue in the third quarter accelerated to $511 million. Organic growth in Europe during the third quarter was 7.2%, reflecting a combination of 10.1% organic growth at ECP and nominal organic growth at Sator.","The impact of acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 5.7% increase in revenue. But these gains were offset by a 9.9% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, creating a negative impact on revenue and resulting in total reported growth for European parts and services of 3%. On a constant currency basis, European revenue growth during the quarter was 13%.","Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.3%, a 260 basis point improvement over the comparable period of 2014. Both Euro Car Parts and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations, about 160 basis points collectively, as we continued to benefit from improved procurement in the UK and the internalization of the gross margin from our acquisitions in the Netherlands.","The remaining balance of the improvement relates to the impact of Sator's acquisitions in 2014 and the related accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP, which depressed margins by about 100 basis points in the third quarter of last year. These are the highest quarterly gross margins we have achieved in Europe since early 2012. With respect to operating expenses in Europe, we lost about 70 basis points to largely due to higher SG&A expense at our UK operation, reflecting higher personnel costs to support the growth of the business, including our e-commerce development.","European EBITDA totaled $53 million, a 26.4% increase, even after taking into account the impact of the strong dollar, which had a negative effect of $4 million. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the third quarter was 10.3% versus 8.4% last year, a 190 basis point improvement. These are some of the best EBITDA margins this segment has posted in quite some time. We anticipate the normal seasonal pattern will continue in 2015. And we would expect these margins will moderate in the fourth quarter.","As noted on slide 19, relative to the third quarter of 2014, the pound sterling declined 7% and the euro declined 16% against the dollar. We estimate that for the third quarter the strong dollar reduced our European revenue by approximately $49 million compared to Q3 of last year. As noted on this page, removing the impact of the currency swings would have resulted in third quarter European revenue growth of 13% and given the margin improvement, EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis of 35%, which we believe is quite strong. When taking all currencies into account, the strong dollar reduced third quarter EPS by about $0.005 compared to last year.","Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the third quarter totaled $283 million, a 41% increase over the comparable quarter of 2014. Obviously, the impact of the acquisitions of Stag Parkway in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Coast Distribution in August of 2015 accounted for the largest component of growth, but the organic growth rate of our Specialty business was 10%, very strong. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the third quarter declined about 120 basis points compared to last year, largely due to procurement and pricing considerations in our Canadian operations, offset in part by a favorable mix shift towards more profitable lines.","On the bright side, operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 150 basis points as we continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices. EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $26 million, reflecting a 45% increase over 2014. And, as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 30 basis points to 9.2% in 2015.","As noted in the last call, this is a highly seasonal business, and the fourth quarter is by far the weakest as demonstrated by the graph in the upper right-hand corner of slide 20. We expect the Coast acquisition will accentuate the margin drop in Q4. So you should expect the margins to again moderate meaningfully as the selling activity moves lower towards the end of the year.","Now, let's move on to capital allocation, which, given the working capital swings, the lumpiness of capital spending, and the timing of acquisitions, is best viewed on a year-to-date basis, as set forth on slide 22. You will note that our after-tax cash flow from earnings for the first nine months was approximately $432 million and we experienced a $59 million decrease in net operating assets and liabilities, which were the primary drivers behind the $491 million of cash provided by operations during the first nine months of the year.","Thus far in 2015, we have deployed $254 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $100 million to fund capital expenditures and $154 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. So for the first nine months, we generated $237 million of free cash and we used approximately $215 million of that to repay our debt balances. The remaining $22 million was added to our liquidity. And we closed the quarter with approximately $137 million of cash, of which about $87 million is held in Europe.","At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of total debt outstanding, which, on a GAAP basis, was approximately 2.0 times our latest 12 months EBITDA. The available capacity on our credit facility was approximately $1.3 billion, which we believe provides adequate liquidity to fund the continued growth of our business.","Finally, as noted in our press release, we have adjusted our guidance on some of the key financial metrics for the year as we lace to organic growth for parts and services. We are at 7.3% through the first nine months. We have tightened the full year range from what was 7% to 8.5% to 7.0% to 7.5%, which essentially implies 6% to 8% organic growth during the fourth quarter.","In terms of earnings per share, we're narrowing the guidance a bit to $1.39 a share on the low end to $1.44 on the high end. This all assumes that the pound sterling, euro and Canadian dollar remain at current levels and, importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. The corresponding net income guidance is $428 million to $442 million.","We have adjusted guidance for cash flow from operations up from $450 million during our last call to $525 million to $550 million, reflecting the continued solid cash earnings of the company and a moderate investment in working capital during the fourth quarter. And, finally, we have moved the guidance for capital spending down a bit to $135 million to $150 million, basically, reflecting the fact that we are at $100 million for the first nine months.","And, with that, I will turn the call back over to Rob.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nick. Looking at the remainder of the last quarter of 2015 and preparing for 2016, our outlook continues to be optimistic. We're laser-focused on our mission statement of being the leading global value-added distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive available and cost-effective selection of parts solutions, while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate.","In North America, I am encouraged by the trends in miles driven, the continued growth in the average number of parts per claim, the increase in the per unit share of APU, the increased costs of repairs pushing carriers to seek alternative parts to lower their costs and the consistent pipeline of acquisition opportunities we're witnessing across all of our business lines.","In Europe, the macro trends are also attractive. In the UK, new car registrations are annualizing at the highest level since 2005 with vehicle miles through June at the highest rolling annual total ever. Europe, as a whole, in 2014 witnessed its first registration increase since 2007, a positive long-term trend for the types of aftermarket mechanical and service parts we offer in this segment.","In Specialty, the size of the SEMA market is material and fragmented, a cornerstone to our business model and founding strategy. We continue to identify deals within Specialty that, through acquisition, create tremendous synergies and scale within our existing network.","And, in closing, I want to thank our over 31,000 team members who daily endeavor to drive organic sales, promote the use of alternative parts and implement operational efficiencies to enhance the productivity of our organization and enhance the experience of our customers, which, ultimately, will reward our stockholders now and over the long-term.","And, with that, Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone, and congrats on a good, solid quarter.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nate. Good morning.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","So a couple things. I wanted to talk about a little bit in terms \u2013 over in Europe in terms of like ECP. You just mentioned, obviously, some good macro trends in terms of miles driven going on over there and, obviously, we have more parts injections. But, as you slow, obviously, that increase in branch count, we mature that, which we're getting close to, could you talk about the big drivers over the next several years like kind of in terms at least the footprint you have today beyond any additional acquisitions in terms of what are the opportunities, breaking it down in terms of just market share gains versus new product injections, et cetera?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Certainly, Nate, we're at the tail end. This year \u2013 so the end of Q4, we'll be over 200 locations. And we've always said the right number is 225. So we're certainly at the tail end. Obviously, the new park introductions are going to be huge for us. We plan on bringing reman parts into the marketplace, recycled parts as well. So there's a lot of opportunity to bring the products we have here in the U.S. over to the UK. So we do think the overall market conditions are good.","On top of some of the tailwinds you mentioned, the strong surge in SAAR rate that we're seeing here in the U.S. is also occurring in the UK and on the continent. And we know when those cars come out of warranty they're going to be a real driver of the business. The average age of the car part in the UK is 7.8 years old, but it's expanding. And on the continent, it's 8.6 years old and expanding. So we think as these cars get older, it's going to provide a nice tailwind.","The other thing that I do want to talk about really, what we've really been focusing on this last quarter is the focus on the gross margin there at ECP, as you saw in the numbers. So while initially a headwind in terms of really driving down our selling cost, our selling prices to the customers, we are going to see we believe a consistent effort to grow our top-line as well on top of that as well as the gross margin. So I think with all the macro drivers and some of the stuff we're doing internally, we're in good shape there.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Sounds good. Thanks for that. And then second question. Obviously, you pointed out some good initial results from your kind of endeavors on the consulting arrangement. And we talked about maybe seeing some benefits in 2016. And, obviously, this individual project in the small area had good results. Can you talk about maybe what you're seeing so far in terms of the opportunity to monetize any of those initial efforts across the entire network where it could produce something that actually is meaningful in terms of results for next year?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",">: Yeah. Let me talk about the four different areas that we're focusing on, Nate. First, routing software. We are launching our first routing software initiative next week in Florida. So that's our first shot at that. The purchasing area that we've been focusing on, we've got a lot of RFQs out in the marketplace today. So those will start coming in pretty soon.","The sales changes I talked about in Florida are going well. And we do plan on expanding those. The last one on our list was the dismantling centers. We are bringing some Six Sigma black belts on to the payroll to work on getting those implemented. It just really is too early to talk about what the net gain is going to be, although initially we've been very pleased with what we think we're going to be able to attain here. But it really just is too early to monetize what the net effect is going to be.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And I appreciate the time. And I'll turn it over.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you and good morning, everyone.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jim.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I wanted to ask as well on the European segment, just to the considerations for the fourth quarter as it relates to margins. You obviously had a great result in the third quarter but help us understand. You're balancing, I think, some easier compares year-over-year. If I recall, there's some pull forward costs related to a competitor bankruptcy last year and some other expansion. You've got a new UK facility, though, that's starting to come online as well this year. So how do we sort of balance that and how do we think about kind of the year-over-year trends looking forward into the fourth quarter?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're right, Jamie. There was a bit of a pressure on margins over Europe in Q4 of last year. We think most of that is behind us. Again, we showed solid improvement during Q3. We do anticipate that the margins in Q4 should be a little bit better than last year. But it is a seasonal business, much more than here in the U.S. So it's important to keep that in mind. So we do anticipate that the margins will creep down in Q4 relative to where they are right now.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So if I'm hearing, we should just moderate the rate of change that we saw in the third quarter when we're thinking about our fourth quarter models?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's fair.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then just a quick question as well, maybe an update really on your plan to essentially buy fewer higher quality or higher priced cars. How is that progressing? Is it still kind of too small relative to the 200,000 or so you're buying to really be impactful? Or is that a bigger chunk of the pie than we're giving it credit?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're starting to see the benefits of that, Jamie, for sure, buying the better car. Obviously, as the car park gets a little younger, we're buying about a half a model year better for the same price. And I think what's really impacting our cost at auctions, quite frankly, is the strong dollar is keeping a lot of the exporters out. And, of course, scrap is bringing it down as well. But that's a strategic initiative we're moving forward. And we're very pleased with the results. We're actually getting more dollars per car than we did with the older car.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Well, I would imagine an ancillary benefit though is probably pretty small, is sort of the reduced exposure to scrap in the sense that you're buying fewer cars, right?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely, yeah. That would certainly be a positive. But it's basically we're flat. We're down 1.4% year-over-year. And I think we'll be in that same range of about the same number of cars here going forward. We did have a healthy backlog coming out of Q1 and Q2, which did allow us to buy a little bit less in Q3.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Well, thank you so much and congrats on a great third quarter. And good luck in the fourth.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Nick, the free cash flow upside this year has been the talk of investors, I guess, early this morning. What are the key factors behind that and how sustainable is it given it's driven by some working capital benefits?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Craig. There's no doubt that we have benefited on the working capital side. Again, the $491 million of free cash or operating cash flow, if you will, for the first nine months reflects strong earnings, basically $432 million, but then a net decrease in working capital. I don't believe that we're going to be able to run the business for the next several years continuing to reduce the amount of working capital. Again, some of that has to do with the fact that Q4 of last year at year-end \u2013 again, we really bulked up the inventory in anticipation that there could be some issues at the ports during the first quarter and second quarter. And so our inventory balances are actually coming down from the end of last year. Again, we had some increase in payables as well, which helped matters. So we took the guidance for the year up just reflecting the fact that we're well ahead of where we anticipated we would be. But, again, I think, for modeling purposes, folks should assume that, on an ongoing basis, we're going to need to increase working capital pretty much in line with our revenue growth.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","As a follow-up, just given the upside, even though it may not be entirely sustainable, but still strong, is there an opportunity to go to your rating agencies and look for a re-rating of any kind?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Probably not. I mean, we keep in constant dialogue with both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. We think we've got a great relationship there. At the end of the day, it's going to take a little bit more than just an uptick in free cash flow, if you will, I think, to get us to investment grade land.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then just, lastly, on your facility in the UK, the new distribution center you're working on. I'm curious if you can quantify what you think might be some of the benefits from a fulfillment rate perspective or a delivery frequency perspective. I'm trying to compare it really to a competitor in the U.S., O'Reilly, which has used really some scale advantages as a distribution center operator to take meaningful share. And I'm wondering if that's a decent analogy.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it is correct. We will be able to service our branches much better. And with the excess capacity, we'll have deeper inventories as well. So I think we can buy better as well. Hopefully, we'll be able to buy bulk, much larger and be able to service our branches and our hubs much quicker with that facility. It's going to be fully automated \u2013 a good portion of it's going to be automated that will allow us to be real efficient in terms of space and everything else. So a real positive and I think it's going to really allow us to get a lot more efficient on both the sales and service side of the business.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi, Good morning.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Tony.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","The first question I have \u2013 and it looks like all of your businesses outside of sort of the metals exposed are doing well. But when you look at the comment, I think, you talked about 2016 introduction of alternative parts in the Sator business. Can you maybe give a little bit more understanding of the process that's involved there, sort of, the ramp time and what you see as the opportunity as you introduce those newer alternative parts?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Tony. Obviously, we have 17 carriers in the UK that we're going to use them as our launching pad as we get to the continent. Many of those right also in the continent, so from the UK, so we have those relationships already built. In terms of the product, it's the same vendors we're using in the UK, so that won't be difficult. It's really just getting \u2013 our first process was to flip from three step to two step. And now that we're virtually done with that, now we can control that last mile of distribution. So it's really going to be working with the insurance companies on the continent to show them our results that we've had in the UK.","In terms of the market opportunity, the OEs have about a 93% market share on the continent, so lots of opportunity. We've been very successful in the UK, as we mentioned in my script, 34% growth year-over-year. And the numbers are getting larger and larger obviously as we continue to grow that side of the business. So we think there's a sizable opportunity, once we get the products launched in the Holland (45:06) market.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Is it similar to, with respect to the U.S., in terms of you get to a certain point and then maybe there's a little bit more pushback, but it's easier to introduce parts when the concentration is so heavy on the OE side right now?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's fair. And it's actually interesting. I think as we get deeper and deeper, it actually gets easier. There won't be a pushback. The initial pushback comes at the beginning, getting people to switch and trust the ability for us to service the customer. Once that's accomplished, I think, it gets so much easier, actually.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then if I could ask one more question. The self-serve side of the businesses, we're talking a lot about scrap and the negative overhang on metals. I'm assuming the demand side at your self-service business is still very strong and robust relative to the market. And, one, is that true? And then, second, as you look at scrap, these prices are down at levels we saw back in 2008 and 2009 after being up at $250, $300 a crushed ton. Do you get the same lag time in terms of recovery as you do feeling the pressure? So you got 60 days, 90 days of recovery on between the time you buy the car and when you crush it. On the flip side, coming out of it or if scrap prices reverse, do you then get the benefit on that lag time as well?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll take the question about the demand and I'll let Nick talk about the scrap. The demand, our admissions have never been higher actually at our facilities. The average model year car in the United States is 11.4 model years old. So the demand is very strong. That's not an issue whatsoever. What we're seeing a little bit is scrap prices have dropped. Some of the people that we procure the product from, the tow yards, the municipalities, et cetera, some of these people are hoarding the inventory until scrap comes up. So it's a little more difficult to purchase our products, but the demand is as high as it's ever been.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep. And on the scrap, self-service has roughly a 90-day, maybe 120-day time between where the cars \u2013 we purchase the cars. They are then fed into our facilities and then ultimately head to the crusher. So, on the full service side, obviously, that's a much longer duration. But three months to four months we basically turn the inventory on the self-serve side. So, in theory, as prices begin to head in a northward direction as opposed to a southward direction, we should get benefit there as well.","It all has to do with the price that we paid for the car and the underlying value that we're getting from the scrap. And we've actually been able to buy pretty effectively. We're bringing our purchase price for the cars down as scrap prices has fallen. But, again, there is always that lag there. And that lag will be there on the way up as well.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just to put some color on that, Tony. Our average price at a self-serve location is down $103 per car year-over-year. So, we've taken a lot of cost out of the purchase. And the full service is down $18 year-over-year. But, again, I think that's a little misleading because we are buying a better car. So I think we're actually doing much better than the $18 shows.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. That's great. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Just touching on the specialty industry. Following the Coast acquisition, are there any other sizable competitors there or anyone of any meaningful competitive threat? And then, when you think about the product offerings that you offer today, are there any offerings that you would like to bring onboard or that you could potentially bring onboard through bolt-on acquisitions?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ben. There are sizable competitors in the marketplace still. Remember, we operate in the entire SEMA market which is well over $34 billion. We're only operating in the $5.6 billion part of that segment. So lots of competitors out there still and a lots of opportunities to keep growing the business. And that pipeline in our industry \u2013 that acquisition pipeline is very active actually, that side of the business.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just touching on the ECP same-store sales, branch growth. Obviously, strong new car sales, I suspect, are creating a little bit of a near-term headwind, obviously a long-term tailwind. Is that mid to high single-digit growth expectation you laid out for the full year on the last call still a reasonable expectation?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it is. I think with just some of the macro trends, they're benefiting from miles driven increasing. The new car park, as we just mentioned, as I said earlier, once that car ages three years, gets out of the warranty side of the business, we expect our business to be very strong there, so, on that side. The collision is still doing very well. I think our paint business is dragging down the organic. It was never going to grow at the size of the parts business. So that's kind of bringing in the number a little bit. But I do feel pretty confident that strong single-digits, low double-digits are going to be achievable with the macro trends we're facing.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen. So kind of related to that last one. In Europe, your organic growth was 7.2%, which is below the trend we've seen elsewhere. ECP is still is pretty strong, about 10%. Anything to call out in the Netherlands in terms of the organic growth rate?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Two things on the Netherlands, Bill, that are probably worth noting. We had a really strong Q2. It was a very mild spring on the continent. And we believe a lot of that repair work may have been pushed from Q3 into Q2. And the other thing that we're doing is obviously with the heavy acquisitions we're doing from three-step to two-step, there's a lot of revenue moving as we acquire new businesses we're cannibalizing from other locations. So it may be shifting from an older location that was comping to a newer location that we didn't get the benefit of the organic growth. So we do think that's going to start to level out again and will be back to where we think we should be, which is mid single-digits of organic growth.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And then a question maybe for Nick. You had a $3 million other income item on your P&L. What was that?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Most of it related to FX items.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","So kind of non-cash then or the hedges or what?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Mostly non-cash items, Bill. Again, nothing material.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So not \u2013 and also, I guess, sort of non-recurring then? I mean is that something we should be looking for in the quarters ahead?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I mean, the FX goes along with where the currencies are swinging and the like. So we would never kind of plan on that being a recurring item.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Understood. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Just housekeeping. Could you give us what you have for the alternative parts penetration year-over-year in North America and then the UK number?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In the U.S., we get quarterly updates, but it's really moving. But it's in that 36% to 37% range. And in the UK, we're closer to 9% plus. The last figure we got from Solaire (53:21) at the time. Up from 7%, we got in the business, Bret, in 2012.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, in Specialty, as you're looking around the M&A environment, I guess, you wouldn't be buying a manufacturer. Would you buy a to-consumer brand like a Summit or a JEGS or a QuadraTec or is that too much sort of a catalog retail presence? You need more of a distribution model.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We do play in that performance side of the business, Bret. That is one of the segments we are in. We certainly would look at anything that we could obviously lever. They do have \u2013 both of those companies have a strong e-commerce presence, which is attractive to us. But at this point, we're just looking at all of the opportunities. And since they are in that segment, we certainly would be interested in that business.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, one last question. On ECP, the 6.2% comp, do you have a feeling for what the underlying market growth was there? I mean, that would seem to be a share gain comp, but do you know what the number that you're selling against was?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The 6.2% comp?","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. I think you said the 12 month and older ECP stores were up 6.2%. What was the market up do you think?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've been told the market is growing circa GDP, so 2%ish.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bret.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please proceed with your question.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Hello, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jason.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Just looking at FX and scrap, assuming that rates and prices remain at current levels, what do you expect the EPS impact will be in the fourth quarter?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, if FX rates stay where they are today, again, probably a little bit less than $0.005, on the scrap side, figure $0.02 relative to last year. I mean we continue to chunk down. And the scrap prices really didn't start to come in meaningfully until early Q1 of this year. So we won't get the real benefit.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","And then, how about the tax rate for the fourth quarter?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You should assume for the year that we'll be at the 34.75%. That's our best estimate at this point in time.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Okay. And then, finally, if you wouldn't mind providing an update on the State Farm aftermarket chrome bumpers, as well as your JV in Australia.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Jason, on State Farm, the bumpers, the ones that they are writing in the aftermarket were up 16.6% year-over-year, so really impressive growth. We now have 467 certified parts available just in the bumper line, so very pleased with that. We talk to State Farm all the time, nothing more than that.","On Australia, we keep moving forward with the partnership there. And it's a slow, steady race, but growing our top-line very nicely and expect to do a little bit more here in the coming quarters in terms of potential acquisitions and more product entry.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Thank you very much.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Van Horn with FRB (sic) [FBR] (56:47) Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick question on Sator and I apologize if you went over this. But could you just update it now that you've kind of completed these four acquisitions, update us on the competitive landscape over there and where you guys are kind of positioned? And have you quantified kind of the addressable market for that business after these acquisitions?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a competitive marketplace. We're now in a position to really control that last mile of distribution. So we do still have some wholesale customers as well. So we're kind of playing in both of the markets. The car park is growing there. And it presents a great opportunity. We think that our small entry into France \u2013 we have three locations in France \u2013 provides another opportunity to keep growing the business. So we think it's a great opportunity to really grow the business in all segments of the markets we operate, the Benelux, as well as the France markets as well.","Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And these last four really puts you at a competitive advantage over some of the other guys over there, right?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We certainly believe that now that we're pretty much where we need to be in terms of the three-step to two-step, we're in a great position because our inventory is strong. We can leverage not only our existing inventory in the Netherlands, but we have backup in the UK as well. So we think we're in a great position.","Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Good stuff. And then secondly on Coast, have you guys talked about \u2013 is the dynamics in that market similar to auto in terms of the sweet spot of the age of the vehicle? And what kind of trends are you seeing in the addressable market there?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Remember the Coast business and our accessory business really isn't tied to collisions. It's more tied to the upgrading of the vehicle or accessorizing of the vehicle. So it's really tied to the SAAR rate. As new car sales and new RV sales continue, people are more likely to accessorize their vehicle at time of purchase. So we think we're in a great position on all side of the accessory business because of that strong SAAR rate. People are going to do this, most likely upgrade their vehicle at the time of purchase. The other thing that's attractive about that is the dealerships often finance those type of upgrades. So they roll right into the notes. So we're pretty optimistic. As long as the SAAR rates stay strong, we've got a nice tailwind there.","Christopher Van Horn - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Thanks for taking the call again. Thanks.","Robert L.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Joe Boutross, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Joseph Boutross","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, LKQ's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning, as well as the accompanying slide presentation for the call.","Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.

And as normal norm, we are planning to file our 10-K in the next few days.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.","Dominick Zarcone","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your time and attention at this early hour. This morning, I will provide some high level comments related to our operations in the fourth quarter and then Varun will dig into the segments, the related financial details, and then discuss our 2019 guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks.","Taken as a whole, we made good progress in the fourth quarter with the various operational initiatives we implemented throughout 2018. We did however experienced some challenges in achieving the expectations we set forth in our previous guidance, primarily related to our European operations.","Make no mistake, these challenges have not changed our focus on the four key themes we outlined in our last call. Our continued pursuit of profitable revenue growth, progress on our margin improvement plans, excellent cash conversion and the optimization of our capital allocation strategy.","Now on to the quarter. As noted on Slide 5, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3 billion, an increase of 22% over the $2.5 billion recorded in the comparable period of 2017. Parts and services organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 2.5%. Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ's stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $40 million, a decrease of 68% year-over-year. ","Diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ\u2019s stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $0.13 a share as compared to $0.41 for the same period of 2017, a decrease of 68%. The fourth quarter 2018 results include non-cash impairment charges net of tax of $48 million related to the company's equity investment in Mekonomen and $26 million related to goodwill recorded on our 2017 acquisition of an aviation parts recycler. These impairment charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 by $0.23. Varun will address both these items in his commentary.","On an adjusted basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders was $151 million, an increase of 19.7% as compared to the $126 million for the same period of last year.","As noted on Slide 6, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $0.48 an increase of 17.1% as compared to the $0.41 for the same period of 2017.","With respect to capital allocation, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of $26.41, reflecting a $60 million return of capital to our shareholders.","As stated during our last earnings call, our strong capital position and healthy cash flow affords us the opportunity to continue investing in our strategic growth drivers all simultaneously utilizing a share repurchase program to maintain a balance capital allocation strategy.","Let's turn to the quarterly segment highlights. As you all know from Slide 7, organic revenue growth for parts and services in our North American segment was 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter of 2017.","Excluding the impact for the battery contract with FCA, which just started on January 1, 2018, organic growth for the rest of the North American segment, was 2.4%. Still, we continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision- and liability-related auto claims were down 0.9% in the fourth quarter and up only 0.1% for the full-year 2018.","We believe this outperformance in our growth relative to the CCC data is due to the continued increase in the number of vehicles in our collision sweet spot that being model years we did 10 years old and an 18% increase in the number of alternative parts utilized on a per claim basis over the past five years.","Also according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q4 was achieved all miles driven in the United States were down 0.5% from October and up just 0.3% on a nationwide basis in November.","During Q4, the salvage line of business launched the implementation of a software platform that uses predictive analytics and multiple data input beats to refine the analysis in calculating the most accurate part prices, which in turn will be used to determine the value of total loss vehicles to LKQ and provide more accurate pricing determination at the auctions.","We believe the early stages of this price optimization effort played a key role in the organic growth for recycled parts outpacing that of aftermarket parts in the fourth quarter and for the first time in 2018.","Related to our recycling business, I am proud of our North American teams\u2019 environmental efforts in 2018, between our full service salvage and self service businesses, in 2018, we processed over 872,000 vehicles resulting in among other things, the recycling of 1.4 million catalytic converters, 2.2 million tires, 560,000 batteries, 2.4 million gallons of waste oil in over 4 million gallons of fuel. This effort is a key pillar in our mission of being a responsible steward of the environment in a true partner with the communities in which we operate.","We also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision SKU offerings and the total number of certified parts available each growing 5.2% and 11.5% respectively in 2018.","Our North American team continued to make solid progress with respect to the margin recovery efforts despite facing ongoing cost pressures, primarily from wage, fuel and freight inflation. These efforts include being disciplined in terms of pricing and discounts, and realizing continued improvements with our telematics and Roadnet platforms. During the fourth quarter 96% of the 326,000 manifests in North America were created through Roadnet with better routing inefficient trucks, fuel consumption and miles driven were reduced by 1.7%.","Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 47%, primarily driven by the acquisition of Stahlgruber. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 0.3%, reflecting a pullback from Q3 levels and well below our expectations.","The European demand was soft across many of our key markets, including the UK, Benelux and Italy. During the fourth quarter and full-year our Rhiag business witnessed negative growth in Italy. In Q4, 2018 Italian economy shrank by 0.2% following a 0.1% decline in Q3.","With that, Italy's economy officially tripped into recession and the economic contraction is expected to continue for sometime, which could create a difficult market for our operations as well. Euro Car Parts posted organic growth in Q4 and full-year 2018, but the quarterly results were well below our expectations.","The UK continues to struggle with the Brexit negotiations and the economic uncertainty appeared to have a negative impact on overall demand with most market participants reporting low single-digit organic growth. STAHLGRUBER performs in line with expectations but we are closely monitoring the economic conditions in Germany which have shown signs of a slowdown. When looking at Europe as a whole a soft economic outlook has shaped our expectations for our 2019 organic revenue guidance.","Regarding Brexit the whole world is waiting to see what comes of the ever changing discussions both within the UK and between the UK and the EU. A couple of de-risk revolve around the fact that most of what is consumed in the UK including automotive parts originates outside of the UK. Indeed a majority of the inventory purchased by the ECP and Andrew Page comes from EU countries.","Accordingly a further weakening of the sterling relative the other currencies couldn't place the cost of procurements and any trade disruptions in terms of getting inventory into the country could create issues in servicing customer demand. With respect to the currencies we do hedge a portion of our expected inventory purchases a few months forward using FX contracts.","On the product front all of our UK based businesses have been working to ensure we have a minimum number of months coverage on all types of inventory including fast movers, mid movers, and even certain slow moving SKUs. This is involved a variety of activities including placing advanced orders increasing stock holdings at ECP facilities and working with key suppliers to have them create buffer stock at their facilities within the UK prior to the end of March.","The interest of the ECP and our suppliers are directly aligned and we have been working proactively with these partners several of which have extended payable terms to offset the cash impact of building inventories. While there are many unknowns related to how Brexit will impact the UK in Europe we believe we have the broadest and deepest inventory in the market and our confident that we will be able to meet our customer's needs.","While the overall European market weakness has provided some headwinds we are also actively addressing the Company specific operating challenges we've experienced to assure we can continue to maintain our market-leading positions and capture the opportunities that we believe our long-term European strategy presents for our Company and our stockholders. Some of the changes relate to new productivity programs all others involve changes in leadership. I will cover a few of our key initiatives in my closing remarks.","As I mentioned in our May 2018, Investor Day talent acquisition is a key initiative for European segment and in Q4 we made solid progress on this front. On December 20 the Company announced that Arnd Franz will join LKQ Europe as Chief Operating Officer on April 1. Arnd is currently Corporate Executive Vice President and Member of the Management Board of the MAHLE Group, where he is been responsible for the company\u2019s global automotive sales and application engineering, including their aftermarket business unit.","From 2006 to 2013, he was Executive Vice President and General Manager for MAHLE Aftermarket. Arnd will report directly to John Quinn, CEO of LKQ Europe. Arnd brings nearly 20 years of experience with Tier 1 automotive suppliers across Europe and has a strong record of successful integration efforts. He will be a great addition to the LKQ Europe leadership team.","Specific to Euro Car Parts, on January 2 of this year, the company announced that Andy Hamilton was appointed ECP\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Andy joined ECP in 2010, where he held several executive roles, the last of which was Chief Operating Officer. During that period, ECP saw unprecedented growth as the network group from 89 to over 220 branches. Prior to ECP, Andy held a variety of management roles for Halfords Group, the UK's leading automotive and leisure retailer with over 500 locations.","Additionally at ECP, we recently added two key people to the leadership team, including a Chief Administrative Officer and a Chief Supply Chain Officer. The Chief Administrative Officer and Varun actually worked together during their respective times at both CBRE and Johnson Controls. The primary task for this position is to focus on ECP support and governance functions with overall responsibility for legal, finance, and human resources, thereby freeing Andy to focus on customer facing and operating matters.","The Chief Supply Chain Officer worked at ECP from 2014 to 2016 and we are excited to have him back on the team. The main responsibilities for this role are ECP\u2019s logistics and supply chain activities, including the leadership of the T2 facility.","Finally, during Q4 we opened up a total of five new branches in Eastern Europe. Since acquiring Rhiag in 2016, we have opened 94 branches in Eastern Europe, and as we enter 2019, we are now focused on maximizing the productivity of our existing branches with just a handful of new openings planned for this year.","Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During Q4, Specialty reported total revenue growth of 8.9% including organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5.8% and acquisition growth of more than 3%. Specialty continues to deliver strong results with EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter and full-year 2018 both achieving their highest levels since we entered this segment in 2014.","During the 2018 SEMA Show, the Specialty team launched a new mobile app that is capable of putting the power of their industry best eKeystone business-to-business system into any device. This app harnesses mobile device technology, including voice-to-text capability to allow users to search for products simply by saying a category or brand and utilizes the mobile device camera to scan QR, UPC and vehicle VIN numbers and VIN barcodes.","The eKeystone app includes all the proprietary data in Keystone\u2019s B2B system, thereby providing subscribers access to approximately 800,000 cataloged SKUs, 400,000 images, 20,000 videos, and 40,000 installation instructions and more. We are pleased with the early adoption rates of the app which thus far have generated close to 4,000 downloads from our Keystone Automotive Operations customers.","This was a tremendous initiative and I credit our Specialty teams\u2019 effort to think outside the box and deliver solutions that enhance customer service and drive incremental sales.","Moving on to corporate development, during the fourth quarter, we acquired three wholesale businesses in North America and two wholesale businesses in Europe for a total net consideration of approximately $14 million.","And finally, I would like to highlight that our Board has approved management suggested changes to the structure of our compensation programs, whereby the incentives are directly in lined with our Company wide objectives.","For our key leaders across the globe, the 2019 annual bonus program will incentivize EBITDA, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue, as well as improvements in free cash flow generation.","For the long-term cash incentive plan, the incentives will be based on return on invested capital, organic revenue growth and EPS growth over a three-year period. In addition, we are creating a new long-term performance share program high to the achievement of the same target metrics.","And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who run you through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2019 guidance.","Varun Laroyia","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through our consolidated and segment results for the quarter, cover our current liquidity position, and provide 2019 guidance before turning it back to Nick for closing remarks.","The fourth quarter results featured several solid accomplishments and some further opportunities for us to realize. On the positive side, three key points to highlight. Number one, we continue to integrate STAHLGRUBER and I am happy to report that the business is performing in line with expectations and that we are achieving the synergies projected at this stage.","Two, our Specialty segment, which historically had generated its lowest segment EBITDA, margin in the fourth quarter, so an 80 basis points year-over-year improvement in this metric, largely due to effective margin management initiatives.","And finally, three, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $190 million, which in total produce the highest annual operating cash flow in the Company's history at $711 million and free cash flow of $461 million. I am very proud of the team's dedication to working capital management, which I am confident will carry through into 2019 and beyond.","On the other side of the ledger, as Nick described, we experienced some softness in revenue growth in the quarter in both North America and Europe. As previously noted, the North America segment was able to withstand the revenue softness relatively well, while in Europe the softness in revenue growth created pressure on a segment EBITDA margin. I will provide further color on this when we discuss segment performance.","There is a larger spread between our GAAP and adjusted figures this quarter than we are typically accustomed to reporting. The variance is attribute to the under-performance of two specific investments, which resulted in an impairment charge in the fourth quarter totaling $75 million on an after-tax basis or about $0.23 per share.","Firstly, we recorded a $33 million goodwill impairment charge related to our aviation recycling business in North America that we acquired in early 2017. The changing market conditions have dampened our outlook for this business, prompting the charge, which was recognized as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment.","And second, in the equity earnings line, which is where we report our share of the results of Mekonomen. We recorded a loss of $46 million in the quarter. This loss is attributable to $48 million non-cash impairment charge on our Mekonomen investment.","We recorded $23 million charge in the third quarter and unfortunately the stock price decline further through December 31, necessitating another write-down. Since year end, Mekonomen has announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results and revised its dividend policy that has resulted in yet another drop in its stock price.","Unless there is a turnaround in the stock price in the coming weeks, we will need to record a further impairment charge in the first quarter. We clearly disappointed in the performance of our investment in Mekonomen, and are hopeful that the worst is behind us.","Now I\u2019ll turn to Slide 13 and 14 of the presentation for a few points on the consolidated results. The consolidated gross margin percentage increase 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.7% as positive improvements in both Europe and Specialty segments more than offset a negative mix impact related to Europe. Specifically the lower gross margin Europe segment now makes up a larger percentage of the consolidated results following the STAHLGRUBER acquisition, but again as I mentioned we could more than offset this impact.","Our operating expenses increased by 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter primarily attribute to the negative leverage effect in Europe due to revenue softness that I mentioned earlier. Interest expense was up $10 million or 37% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, due to higher average debt balances primarily related to the STAHLGRUBER financing.","Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate was 28.3% for the quarter the annual base tax rate was roughly 27.2% which is consistent with third quarter estimate. The higher rate for the fourth quarter reflects a roughly $1 million net negative impact from discrete items. We completed our analysis of the impact from U.S. tax reform and I'm happy to report that there were no adjustments to the provisional amounts in Q4.","Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter were $0.13 down $0.28 relative to the comparable quarter a year-ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.48 reflecting a 17% improvement year-over-year.","Moving to the segments with North America on Slide 17, gross margins during the fourth quarter were 43.5% of flat compared to the prior year. Our pricing initiatives in the aftermarket line have been successful in realizing gross margin benefits that we experience in offsetting decrease in a salvage operations at car costs have moved higher with the mix shifting towards newer model year purchases.","Similar to our aftermarket line we are implementing pricing tools for salvage products to enhance the gross margin generated on each car. Our self-service operations gross margins were roughly flat on a year-over-year basis with non-recurring insurance recovery of setting the negative impact of declining scrap steel prices.","Shifting to operating expenses for North America we saw an increase of 10 basis points both compared to last year and sequentially. There were a few factors working in opposite directions this quarter. Facility expenses increased 50 basis points due to higher rent and utilities expenses and non-recurring these terminations charge. Consistent with the first three quarters we faced headwinds related to freight and vehicle expenses and these costs drew a 30 basis point increase over the prior year.","We actively working to address these headwinds as well as wage inflation and rising benefit costs to the margin initiatives noted previously and also through cost controls throughout the organization. Going the other direction we had non-recurring gain on an asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 that had a favorable 30 basis point impact. The remaining 40 basis points improvement primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense reflecting our strong emphasis on receivable collections.","And finally, we saw a 40 basis point unfavorable movement in segment EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest line. While the operating results of a whole - of a non wholly-owned subsidiaries impact the reported gross margin and operating expense figures, the allocation of the profit or loss from these businesses fall below operating profit.","Last year we allocated a loss from our non wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America to the minority shareholders, but reported income in these businesses in 2018 thereby creating the unfavorable year-over-year comparison. In total segment EBITDA from North America for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $153 million roughly flat compared to the prior year.","Looking at Slide 19, scrap prices were flat versus the comparable quarter a year-ago, but down relative to the third quarter of 2018 by 3%. As we previously mentioned the impact from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time.","Changes in scrap steel prices had a negative effect of approximately $5 million on segment EBITDA or a little over $0.01 on adjusted diluted EPS. The management team remains intensely focused on margin realization and the cost mitigation initiatives launched last year.","Moving on to our European segment in Slide 20, gross margin in Europe was 36.7% in the fourth quarter, a 100 basis point increase over the comparable period of 2017. Our Sator business in the Benelux region continued to show margin expansion, contributing a 30 basis point improvement to the segment with specific strength in private-label sales and the ongoing move from a 3-step to a 2-step model in that market. Our centralized procurement yielded a 40 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs.","With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 120 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter from a year ago. The lower sales growth had a negative impact on operating leverage. STAHLGRUBER results, as I previously mentioned were consistent with the previously disclosed projection for the year.","European segment EBITDA totaled $107 million, a 38% increase over last year. As shown on Slide 22, relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, both the pound sterling and the euro both weakened by 3% against the dollar causing about a $0.01 negative effect from translation on adjusted EPS in the quarter.","Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 7.5% for the fourth quarter of 2018, down 50 basis points from the same period last year due to revenue softness and lower than expected results both in the United Kingdom and Italy.","The management team has implemented cost controls over all geographies, including reviews of discretionary spending and stringent additional approvals for headcount. The European team has reiterated its commitment to the previously stated objective to deliver double-digit segment EBITDA margins by the end of the three-year period that started in January 2018.","Turning over to our Specialty segment on Slide 23. This business continues to deliver solid results. The gross margin percentage improved by 230 basis points in the fourth quarter relative to the comparable period of 2017. Of this amount, 120 basis points related to a non-recurring amortization impact in 2017 related to one purchase accounting, and additional 30 basis points increase is attributable to mix.","Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were flat relative to the prior year. Higher vehicle and fuel expenses and FX causes were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense falling on from the previously mentioned focus on collections.","Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $28 million, up 20% from the fourth quarter of 2017, and as a percentage of revenue segment EBITDA was up 70 basis points to 8.5%.","Let's move on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 25, you will note that our operating cash flows for 2018 was $711 million or up $192 million, a 37% increase versus 2017. Operating cash flows for the quarter was strong at $190 million following the momentum in the third quarter or into an emphasis on receivables collections, and moderate inventory growth. CapEx for the quarter was $78 million and $250 million for the full-year.","In the fourth quarter, we made further pay downs on a credit facility borrowings, while repurchasing $60 million of LKQ stock under the repurchase program launched late last October. For the full-year of 2018, we paid down $206 million on a credit facility borrowings all of this was funded by a strong operating cash flows.","Trade working capital has defined as receivables and inventory offset by payables as a percentage of revenue improved by 250 basis points, reflecting our commitments towards delivering strong cash flow.","I am very heartened by the scale of improvement we could deliver as this has come ahead of the structural change to the incentive compensation program in 2019 and more broad-based working capital efficiency programs.","Moving to Slide 27, we amended and extended our credit facility in the fourth quarter. The changes increase the capacity of a revolving credit facility to $3.15 billion, offset by a lower term loan, extended the maturity through to January 2024, simplify the pricing tiers and immediately reduced our borrowing margin by 25 basis points.","As of the 31 December, we had $332 million of unrestricted cash, resulting in net debt of about $4 billion or 2.9x last 12 months EBITDA. Breaking through the lesson 3x benchmark is a crucial threshold as a further lowers the cost of our credit facility borings based on the revised pricing tiers as part of the credit facility amend and extend, we executed in the fourth quarter.","On Slide 28, we've had the key metrics that we track, though please note that we are excluding the impact of STAHLGRUBER in the calculations to eliminate short-term movements caused by large investments. We will add STAHLGRUBER into the calculations once we've analyzed the transaction.","Now I'd like to detail our annual guidance for 2019. Please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and FX rates hold at current levels and the annual tax rate is dialed in at 27%. Additionally, the guidance assumes no material disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's potential exit from the European Union.","We have set organic parts and services revenue growth at 2% to 4%. Given our fourth quarter revenue growth, the economic uncertainty in Europe and are continuing emphasis on profitable revenue growth, we are moderating our growth assumptions for 2019.","Diluted EPS, on a GAAP basis is a range of $2.05 to $2.17 while adjusted diluted EPS is the range of $2.34 to $2.46. We are projecting solid business growth from a margin improvement efforts and an incremental $0.09 from a full-year of Stahlgruber. On the negative side, lowest scrap prices and a stronger U.S. dollar reduce the year-over-year expectations by $0.07.","Cash flows from operations reflect a range of $775 million to $850 million. We believe our focus on working capital management and increase profitability will drive higher cash flows in 2019.","Capital spending set at a range of $250 million to $300 million, a modest increase from the current year level, though flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis, when we normalize the expected increase or into a full-year of STAHLGRUBER CapEx and various European projects, most notably the ERP implementation. Taking the lower and the top ends of both OCF and CapEx, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $500 million in 2019.","In summary, we remain encouraged by the strength of a market leading businesses do acknowledge that we still have further work to do related to fully realizing the benefits of our initiatives to offset the ongoing cost pressures and to continue to improve profitability.","Now I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing remarks.","Dominick Zarcone","Thank you, Varun for that financial overview. I believe that we are taking the necessary steps to position the Company for continued long-term success. Looking back on 2018, we crossed major milestones that our team of over 50,000 employees across the globe should be proud of, including achieving the highest annual topline revenue in the Company's history, up 22% over 2017, generating the highest annual cash flow figures in the Company's history. With operating cash flow and free cash flow up 37% them 36% respectively over 2017 levels.","Closing the STAHLGRUBER acquisition the largest acquisition in the Company's history, completing the largest capital raise in the Company's history through notes with a in tenure maturities at attractively low fixed interest rates and amending our credit facility to provide more flexibility and better pricing.","With that let me summarize a few of the key initiatives for 2019. First, we have built strong businesses with leading companies in our core geographies. Our focus will now shift towards operational excellence through the integration and simplification of our operating model. The management team will concentrate on leveraging the strengths of the business units for profitable revenue growth, margin improvement and cash conversion.","Second, all of our businesses will be closely monitoring cost to drive-out duplicative expenses, heighten controls over discretionary spending and react quicker the changing market conditions.","Third, we will invest in our future through long-term projects like the ERP implementation in Europe, a centralized European catalog system, and the multi-year development of a new NDC in the Netherlands. All these projects often don't produce an immediate benefit they are essential for positioning the business for future growth and profitability.","Finally, the revamped compensation programs well help ensure the management incentives are in even tighter alignment with the key priorities of the Company and the expectations of our stockholders. In closing, I am proud of how our team of over 50,000 employees performed doing 2018 in the midst of various operating challenges in both North America and Europe.","Our team never took their eye off the ball and continued to work tirelessly to create and evolve what we all believe is a unique company. Our extensive distribution networks the breadth and depth of our inventory and our industry-leading fulfillment rates position as well to deliver consistent profitable growth and drive higher levels of operating efficiencies across all segments. This focus on operational excellence should translate into continued long-term value for our shareholders.","And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Daniel Imbro","Yes. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Dan.","Varun Laroyia","Good morning, Daniel.","Daniel Imbro","I wanted to start on the European business and kind of the outlook for expenses. One clarifier and then a question. Varun, did I hear you right, where there any one-time expenses that drove that deleverage or was it just the lower sales growth of the business that drove the year-over-year decline?","Varun Laroyia","Yes. So if you look at the European margins, Daniel, it was specifically the revenue softness, which caused a loss of operating leverage on that. There weren't any specific one-time is there were, some of the smaller ones, not that material. But that was really associated with some management departures that had been undertaken. But other than that nothing that would come to mind beyond that.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Stephanie Benjamin of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Stephanie Benjamin","Hi. Thanks for the question. Good morning. My question really just goes with expectations and I know reiterated the expectations in Europe to continue to really see that margin improvement in double-digit EBITDA growth in reiteration of that. I'm just wondering, as I look to the guidance for 2019, I think expectations are for a softer topline growth kind of similar to the fourth quarter. So I'm just kind of wanting to hear the puts and takes for you to - for your expectations for margin improvement in Europe in 2019, so you don't see kind of that continued operating deleverage we saw in fourth quarter. So just kind of wanting to hear the offsets of there would be great. Thanks.","Varun Laroyia","Yes. Absolutely, Stephanie. Good morning. It\u2019s Varun Laroyia. Great question. I think, if you kind of look back into 2018 with regards to our European segment. Going back to Q1, you'll recall we had some challenges in the UK operations with our Tamworth facility. Coming out of that, obviously there was a capitalized cost to recover that central distribution center and then they're on, there was also some price discounting that was taking place. So that was kind of one piece that we don't really expect to continue into the future as we think about 2019.","The other piece is, as you think about the broader European landscape. Italy, we know has been soft. And clearly there was a deleverage that ended up taking place out there. And then obviously, some other elements, we get the full-year benefit of some of the distribution centers that we had shutdown in anticipation of Tamworth coming through, and the same thing with Andrew Page also.","So, as you think of some of those kinds of puts and takes, clearly there are certain elements that impacted our 2018 operational results in the European landscape. And as we think about 2019, we do believe that those elements would have stabilized and despite the lower economic activity expected across the European segment, we believe that with the active cost containment programs that are in place, we do believe that we will get better operating leverage from that segment.","Dominick Zarcone","Stephanie, this is Nick. As we go through the planning process each year and a very detailed budgeting process, clearly the expectations for every one of our businesses around the globe is not only to generate good organic growth, but also to improve their margins. And that is true in Europe. It's true actually in the North American and Specialty businesses as well.","And I think you will find the underpinning really of the consensus that Varun walked through is an assumption and some pretty detailed plans by our operating businesses to improve margins across the board with one exception and that's the self-serve business here in the United States, which has to deal with scrap prices, and there's only so much they can do to offset the negative impact from scrap as it relates to our operating margins. But again, it's important to understand that the expectation internally is that all of our businesses on an annual basis have plans to find positive operating leverage in their business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Varun Laroyia","Hey. Good morning, Bret.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan","Hey. Varun, can you give us an update on where we are from a working capital standpoint or your thoughts on leveraging working capital maybe what you could do with payables in Europe or the U.S.?","Varun Laroyia","Yes, absolutely. I think, if I take your question Bret in terms of what's driving \u2013 what drove free cash flow higher in 2018 and as to what gives us the confidence going into 2019 for the free cash flow guidance, two key pieces, really to think through. One, 2018 to 2019 that clearly is the higher profitability from the focus on pursuing profitable revenue, the margin realization initiatives that we launched last year, and also the cost containment programs that are currently in place. So that's kind of just the starting point for free cash flow.","The second point is just active working capital management. And if you think about the momentum that we saw in the third quarter, which we continued into the fourth quarter, really the focus has been on some very simple elements in the balance sheet. Within our cash flow statement, you can actually see this come through, the focus with collections. In 2017, it was a $56 million outflow and in 2018 it was basically flat. So we didn't invest, despite the fact that business grew significantly. We didn't really invest that much more in receivables because we were actually going and collecting the cash that was due to us.","The second point is if you look at inventory, inventory did grow also on a year-over-year basis with the larger scale of business, but it was about $77 million lower than what it was in 2017, right. And then the final piece quite frankly is the opportunity that's still out there for us to go get. The single biggest piece, which kind of held us back I'd say is, on a year-over-year basis there was $122 million swing on accounts payable. It was a significant outflow, right.","And so as you think about each of these key elements, and as to what we continue to focus on, simplistically there is further opportunity in any case. I think the final piece, which actually is a rapper across the entire working capital and free cash flow piece is the incentive compensation plans and these obviously have been aligned with the goals in 2019.","We don't specifically call out the weightings of each of those elements, but I will share with you, it is not a token measure. It is a substantial chunk of people's incentive compensation to generate free cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Dominick Zarcone","Hey, good morning, Chris.","Varun Laroyia","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Bottiglieri","Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask about \u2013 with revenue growth is slowing a little bit, also recognizing that you're going through implementing a number of projects with fixed margins. Can you help frame for us OpEx growth next? What's kind of like your run rate assumption from SG&A for organically from inflation that what's the net impact of costs saving initiatives versus investments to cut costs, just how you're thinking about that next year?","Varun Laroyia","Yes. So Chris, its Varun Laroyia. With regards to cost containment efforts and also OpEx, a few things to kind of think through, firstly here in North America, a bunch of our wage inflation or the freight elements essentially get analyzed.","And again, what we have seen \u2013 I've seen over the last four to five months as being not a de-acceleration or a downward trend, but basically being a flattening out of some of those expenses that are kind of coming through. So that's point number one.","And clearly from the second half of the fourth quarter, we saw fuel come down, also some not enough to offset the various elements given the fact that wage pressures have kind of flown into the freight costs also.","And as you think about going into 2019, the cost containment efforts specifically what headcount had, we essentially trying to make the business more resilient with the revised projections from a growth perspective, which I believe actually very pragmatic. And quite frankly, the cost structure will follow this level of pragmatism rather than building up across infrastructure, which was geared for far higher growth level as such, right.","And then finally if you think about it, as Nick mentioned in his opening comments, also the overall expectation for each of our businesses is to secure a positive operating leverage. And again, with the change in the incentive compensation plans, there is margin growth both in absolute dollars, but also on a margin percentage that we expect.","So again there are only so much that one can do in terms of being able to realize certain margin benefits. But clearly the cost containment and the OpEx productivity is a key lever and being able to deliver higher year-over-year margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Your line is open.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Craig.","Varun Laroyia","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On a new compensation plan, what are the thresholds for your key performance indicators that you would need to reach in order to generate the incentive?","Dominick Zarcone","Yes. Craig, we don't disclose the absolute thresholds, but you can be assured that they are tied exactly into the 2019 budget, which is tied exactly into the guidance step Varun gave just a bit ago.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is open.","Brian Butler","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Could you provide a little bit more color maybe on the parts and service business down at the geographic level in Europe and U.S. kind of thoughts on how we should think about growth rates and margins \u2013 EBITDA margins for each part of that?","Varun Laroyia","Sure. We don't officially provide guidance on a segment basis, but again 2% to 4% overall, I think you could probably assume that North America, we think North America on an annual basis will be somewhere in the middle of that range. We think Europe is going to be towards the lower end and specialty towards the upper end. So we're really spread across the three businesses.","I think it's also important to recognize that this will vary as we roll through the four quarters of the year. It's not a nice \u2013 set of growth in Q1 and Q2 2018 had monster comps that were working against, if you recall that the organic growth in North America in Q1 2018 was in around the 7% range.","So that is creating a pretty big hurdle. If you will there are a couple things that we anticipate in Q1 that will run against organic growth first, we annualize the battery contract with FCA just to refresh everyone's memory that added about 1% to our organic growth as to what we reported in 2018. So that positive increment will come off the boards if you will.","It is also become a parent that as FCA was ramping their activities with us, that there was some kind of one-time benefits if you will that we got in getting the program up and running and that will not return in 2019. We're really at a steady state now with the FCA battery shipments. And so we're anticipating batteries were actually be down year-over-year in the first quarter.","Also AeroVision clearly not meeting our expectations that's the business where we took the impairment charge here in Q4, our expectation is the businesses underperforming and it will also be down in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. From a margin perspective, again, we're anticipating upticks and margins in each of our businesses with North America being muted a little bit by the significant downdraft on the scrap prices, which has noted in the deck hit us for the better part of $0.04 a share so for the year. And that will be a particularly pronounced kind of in the first quarter, I'm assuming scrap prices hang in where they are today.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is open.","Dominick Zarcone","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Varun Laroyia","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Merkel","So on free cash flow conversion guidance in 2019 applies a little bit of improvement, about 70% my math is right? But I'm wondering what is your long-term target and then more importantly how long it going to take to get there?","Varun Laroyia","Yes, Ryan. So I think as we kind of spoke last May at an Investor conference, I kind of laid out a chart for our investors and obviously a number of view from a sell side perspective also just in terms of the way the business had been trending. And really what I use is I try and keep it as simple as possible and take out all the noise and rate specifically focused on three key elements of working capital.","So receivables plus the inventory offset by accounts payable and there's a slide in the deck that you'll see really, which I cannot highlight with regards to where we went 17 versus the kind of progress you've made in 2018. In 2018 the denominator is actually trailing 12 months performer revenue, which includes a full-year of the transactions, namely Stahlgruber.","So we don't taking reported numbers, we actually taking performer numbers so you can kind of work the count and actually works against us. But that's where the focus has been. And quite frankly, I think, with the incentive compensation, peaceful, so being tied into free cash flow generation. I am quietly confident that our businesses will continue to deliver.","Again, step back and look at the history of the Company, which has been very growth oriented and at this stage of our maturity curve as a company, north of $12 billion is what we kind of forecasting for total revenues in 2019. There are elements that if not growth at all costs and so just management of that piece. But there's an embedded culture and as you know culture is take time before they kind of change.","So again, we put out guidance, which I think is above where the market was expecting us to be. But again, we have plans in place to be able to go deliver on it. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of what's going for 2020, 2021, 2022.","I'd say its one step at a time and I'm really happy to report to successive quarters of improvement on that side. We've clearly put our money where our mouth is with regards to 2019 also in raising overall free cash flow guidance and one step at a time, but I'm confident in terms of the plans we've put in place and as to how those are currently tracking.","Operator","Your next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Your line is open.","Daniel Imbro","Yes. Thanks [indiscernible], hop back in the queue for a follow-up guys. Last quarter, Varun you updated us on your attention to unlock cash flow through increased factoring in the European business specifically at Stahlgruber. Can you provide some more color on that market or an update? And can you remind us on how you guys think about the longer-term opportunity from increasing your factoring in that market?","Varun Laroyia","Yes. So Daniel I think you kind of referring to the unwind of the factoring program that we had through one of STAHLGRUBER subsidiaries. So it wasn't a case of starting up a factoring program. It was actually unwind off a factoring program, which would result in those receivables coming back to us.","So that's what it was. We don't really have an active factoring program we don't want to go down that path. It really where the opportunity is as we've talked about from a European perspective, a number of the same supplier community does provide product into the North American folks out here.","So again, they are well tuned in terms of what the expectations are and we do have a tremendous opportunity from a European perspective to be able to unlock that piece, whether it'd be through a vendor financing program or through an extension of peoples, the end goal is the same to be able to have our payables essentially match the days inventory on hand to a point right. And that's how the conversion would work and then obviously active management on idea so with regards to receivables.","So you are right about the fact that there is an opportunity for our European business. And again it has been contemplated in the plans we've put together with that business and it also reflects the targets that are being tossed with for 2019.","But again just to confirm, there was no startup off the factoring program. It was actually unwind of the factoring program for one of the STAHLGRUBER subsidiaries in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe. Your line is open.","Christopher Bottiglieri","Hi, thanks for taking the second question. Just a question North America, so now you guys are getting a lot tougher on discounting and trying to contain the pricing, what are the CI\u2019s you're thinking about the Caliber and Abra merger? How do you guys manage through that and kind of to what extent you've articulated something that your guidance from this will be helpful? Thank you.","Dominick Zarcone","A great question, obviously both Caliber and Abra are excellent organizations. They've been incredibly good customers of ours for years and years. No surprise. There are a couple of our largest customers, just due to the total number of shops that they operate. On a combined basis, they're going to be at about 1,050 shops across the country, if you will. And they've got posted plans to grow that to north of 1500 shops I think over the next three years or so.","We've got a great relationship with both organizations, and we look forward to being a great partner with them as they continued to move forward in their business plans. Again we believe that we provide an excellent level of service to these organizations. That's why they are big customers of ours.","We can get them the parts they need, when they need them. There's no doubt about it. They already get our largest discounts, if you will, because they're already, amongst our top three or four customers. So we don't anticipate any major changes there.","To the extent that they have market overlap because you got to remember this is a very much a local business. And what happens to go on, say in Dallas, doesn't have anything to do with goes on, and say up in Boston or in Portland, Oregon, right? It's a local business.","And to the extent in any given market, local market, they have overlap where we can find ways to be more efficient in servicing the combined organization. We're absolutely going to have discussions with them to see how we can make their business better and our business better. So again we have tremendous relationships at the very senior levels of both organizations. We're not anticipating any major shifts in our business as a result of the merger. ","Operator","I now turn the call back over to Nick Zarcone.","Dominick Zarcone","So that completes our 2018 full-year earnings call. We absolutely appreciate the time and attention you've given us here this morning. We look forward to chatting with everyone in about 60 days at the end of April when we announced our first quarter results. So again, we think we ended the year, a strong some real progress on a couple of key factors, particularly, the working capital on the cash flow, which is Varun indicated will carry us into the future. And we're look forward to chatting with you again in 60 days. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.","Joseph P. Boutross","Thanks, Christine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we released our third quarter 2012 financial results and updated our full year 2012 guidance.","In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Quinn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rob and John have some prepared remarks, and then we will open the call up for questions.","In addition to the telephone access for today's call, we are providing an audio cast via the LKQ website. A replay of the audio cast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call.","Before we begin our discussion, I'd like to remind everyone that the statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties, some of which are not currently known to us. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it was made, except as required by law.","Please refer to our Form 10-K and other subsequent documents filed with the SEC and the press release we issued this morning for more information on potential risk. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K which we filed with the SEC earlier today. As normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today.","We are pleased with the results we reported this morning. Diluted earnings per share of $0.18 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012 increased 5.9% from $0.17 for the third quarter of 2011. As noted in our press release, the third quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share included a charge equal to $0.01 for a change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and for restructuring and acquisition related expenses. Without this charge, our EPS would have been $0.19, an increase of 12% over the same period last year.","Revenue for the quarter was $1.02 billion, an increase of 29.7%, as compared to $783.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. I am pleased to say that we achieved this year-over-year revenue growth with one less operating day compared to the third quarter of 2011, and that this revenue reflects the second highest quarterly revenue achieved by LKQ, second only to Q1 2012.","During the quarter, we achieved 5.6% organic growth for parts and services and 1.6% total organic revenue growth. Revenue growth from acquisitions was 28.2% in the quarter. After adjusting our revenue results for one less selling day in the third quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services would have been approximately 7%.","I'd like to highlight that our positive total organic growth was accomplished during a period of continued deterioration in scrap prices. The organic growth in our other revenue category for the quarter was negative 18%, primarily driven by the pricing pressures we face in the scrap market.","I am also pleased with the organic growth for parts and services in the quarter, given that during this period, net losses and loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes were down over 50% year-over-year according to insurance industry sources. The continued growth in organic parts and service revenue in 2012 is also a result of the combination of the increased use of alternative parts by insurers and a direct program networks to reduce claims costs, and our continued success of gaining market share from the competition.","As mentioned on previous calls, we were confident that the historical trend of 100 basis point improvement in alternative part usage would continue in 2012. And today, I am pleased to announce that, that goal was achieved through the end of the third quarter. According to CCC Information Services, APU now stands at 38%.","Next, I'd like to share some operational statistics. During the third quarter, we purchased over 60,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 5% increase over Q3, 2011. As for volume at the auctions, supply remains strong throughout Q3 and continues to meet our needs early in Q4. With inventory already on hand, and the continuation of our current run rate for acquiring cars, we have a sufficient inventory to grow our recycled parts operations.","Now turning to our self service retail businesses. During the quarter, we acquired over 106,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, as compared to 90,000 in Q3 of 2011, which is an 18% increase year-over-year.","I'd like to mention that we are starting to see some more pricing relief at the auctions. During the quarter, we witnessed a 5% and a 15% sequential drop in the cost of our wholesale salvage and self-service vehicles, respectively. Please note that part of that cost reduction is related to scrap pricing pressure we faced in the quarter. Despite that correlation, I am encouraged by the reduction in the Manheim Index and the increased SAR [ph] rate, which we believe will take some additional pricing pressure off of our auction procurement efforts.","In our heavy-duty truck operations, during the third quarter, we purchased roughly 2,100 units for resale or parts, as compared to 1,600 in Q3 2011, which is a 31% increase year-over-year.","Turning to Euro Car Parts. We continue to be impressed with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to capture market share and open new store branches. In Q3, Euro Car Parts achieved organic revenue growth of 28% versus a comparable pre-acquisition period. During the quarter, we opened 10 new branches in the U.K., bringing our total branch count to 120. Since the acquisition of ECP in early October 2011, we have opened 31 branches, surpassing the target number of 30, I mentioned on the last call. Given that market conditions in the U.K., combined with the continued success of ECP, we have approved an additional 12 new branch openings for the fourth quarter bringing our total target to 132 branches by year-end.","I would also like to update everyone on our collision parts program in the U.K. that we initiated back in late March. During the quarter, we witnessed strong double-digit year-over-year growth with our collision part sales at ECP. And I expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter, based on the numbers we're seeing for early October. Although these numbers are off of a small base, we are encouraged by the acceptance of alternative collision parts in the U.K., and the accelerated interest and continued dialogue we are witnessing with U.K.-based insurance carriers. Clearly, the continuation of this trend bodes well for ECP's collision part sales as we prepare for 2013.","Lastly on operations. On October 2, the company announced the new Phase 1 technology integration with Mitchell and their RepairCenter ToolStore technology platform, and our proprietary electronic ordering system, LKQ InTouch. This two-way integration provides shops with greater procurement efficiencies by enabling real-time access to our vast inventory of aftermarket and salvage parts. Parts look-up and ordering, which previously required multiple steps and was time-consuming, has now been simplified and streamlined into a workflow process that enables shops the ability with one keystroke to place an order with LKQ via Mitchell's RepairCenter workspace on a real-time basis. This technology advancement is a good illustration of our state-of-the-art operations and our commitment to utilize technology to improve our business.","Now moving to acquisitions. During the quarter, we acquired 2 companies. One that operates 2 self-service yards, 1 full-service yard and a scrap recycling business in South Florida, and one that operates a wholesale salvage yard and aftermarket parts distributor in Missouri. In addition to these 2 acquisitions, in early October, we acquired 2 Canadian companies: Pro Auto Body Parts and BMC Auto Body Parts. Pro Body Parts operates 12 aftermarket parts distribution locations in 7 Canadian provinces, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Saskatchewan. BMC Auto Body Parts operates 3 aftermarket price distributions in Qu\u00e9bec. These 2 acquisitions have strategically enabled us to serve our customers across all of Canada with our aftermarket product lines.","We continue to see attractive acquisition candidates across all of our regions in North America. And I believe our pipeline will support our plan to put additional facilities in key underserved markets. We continue to explore additional product line acquisitions to add to our domestic footprint and product offerings, while simultaneously prospecting other international markets beyond the U.K.","At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results of the quarter.","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. One item of note, we did split the stock during the quarter, so references to earnings per share are on a split adjusted basis.","Starting with revenue. This is our third consecutive quarter recording revenue in excess of $1 billion. Revenue in Q3 was $1,017,000,000, representing a 29.7% growth over the third quarter of last year. Acquisitions drove 28.2% of the growth representing $221 million.","Our total organic growth was 1.6%, and parts and services organic growth was 5.6%. Parts and service growth number includes revenue associated with the new branches opened by ECP since our acquisition, and that added 230 basis points to the growth. Revenue for ECP was $181 million for the quarter, and while we didn't own ECP in Q3 of last year, we believe ECP grew 28% over the same quarter last year, when they achieved sales of $142 million. Partially offsetting the growth in parts and services was a negative organic revenue change in 17.8% in other revenue. This drop equates to a decline in other revenue of $24 million. Other revenues are where we record scrap and cores sales. This negative organic growth was primarily driven by a falling scrap prices, particularly scrap steel. We also had a delay in recognizing, approximately, $6 million of precious metals revenue, which I'll address in a moment.","Total growth credit revenue was positive 1.8% due to acquisitions, slightly more than offsetting the falling scrap pricing. The impact to revenue from foreign exchange was de minimis, but I will remind listeners that beginning in Q4 2012, this number may be a little more volatile with the larger base of foreign revenue coming into play now that we've reached the anniversary of the acquisition of ECP.","In Q3 2012, revenue for our self-service business was $89.2 million, or 8.8% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 36% of this revenue was parts sales, included in recycled and related products, and 64% scrap and core sales included in other revenue.","Our reported gross margin was $410 million or 40.3% of revenue. For the same quarter last year, we reported a gross margin of 42.6%, so we witnessed a decline of 230 basis points. While we note the decline in our gross margin, it's probably worth pointing out that our gross margin dollars grew $75 million for 23% improvement year-over-year.","There are a number of things that impacted the gross margin percentage. As we anticipate in the Q2 earnings call, the largest impact is due to lower scrap and core prices, which we estimate to be approximately 100 basis points. We also mentioned last quarter that through an acquisition, we begin processing additional precious metals ourselves, as we try to prove -- improve the yields from our scrap cars, but that acquisition decreased our gross margin percentage. We estimate the impact of margins due to acquisitions was 40 basis points negative. We incurred an increase in warranty cost of 40 basis points and we had fewer cars under our share disposal and crush-only contracts, which tend to be higher margin, and that added a further 30 basis points to the decline. The balance of the margin change relates to a number of small items including mix.","Our combined cost for facility and warehouse, distribution and SG&A expenses were 29.6% of revenue in Q3 2012, compared to 29.8% in Q3 2011. Rob and I are pleased to see that we appear to begin to getting into better leverage out of these cost again, as our parts and services revenue grows. These cost fell as a percentage of revenue despite the drop in commodity revenue from 17.1% of revenue in Q3 last year to only 13.4% this year. As you'll appreciate, our other revenue category, which was predominantly scrap and core sales, requires little support in the way of these costs. Facility and warehouse cost were 8.5% of revenue, compared to 9.2% in Q3 of last year. This decrease is primarily due to adding ECP, which has a lesser amount of facility and warehouse expenses than our North American operations. Distribution costs were 9.2% this quarter, compared to 8.7% in the same quarter last year. ECP drove 30 basis points of this increase and we saw a 20 basis point increase in North America. Selling and G&A expenses were 11.9% of revenue in Q3 this year and last year. ECP drove a 20 percentage -- excuse me, 20 basis point higher, which we offset in North America, partially through the reduced incentive compensation cost.","During the quarter, we recorded $116,000 of restructuring and acquisition related expenses, as compared to $2.9 million of these costs last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter increased $4.4 million to $16.7 million primarily as a result of acquisitions. The amortization of intangibles and depreciation associated with ECP was the primary driver of the increase.","Net interest expense of $8 million, was $3.1 million higher than the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly due to our higher debt levels as we've been funding our acquisitions out of free cash flow and debt.","Our effective borrowing rate on our bank debt was 3.1% in Q3 2012, and was essentially flat to the prior year. We are showing an expense related to the change in continued consideration liabilities of $1.9 million. This is primarily accretion on the liabilities we've recorded.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 35.1%, compared to 38.5% in Q3 last year. We continue to see some benefit from lower foreign tax rates, as we earn more income offshore. In addition, we recorded $1.3 million of discreet tax adjustments, primarily as a result of the reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate.","On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.18 in Q3 2012, compared to $0.17 in Q3 2011, an increase of $0.01 or 6%. In Q3 this year, we have an adjustment to contingent purchase price to reduce earnings per share by $0.01. Last year, Q3 included a similar dollar amount of restructuring cost, but due to rounding would not have changed the EPS reported figure of $0.17.","And as we've mentioned, in Q3 2011, we had little -- excuse me, in Q3 2011 we had little impact from changes to scrap and core prices. Whereas this year, we were negatively impacted by approximately $0.02.","A few comments on the 9 months year-to-date cash flow and uses of cash. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months of 2012 was $182 million, compared to $159 million in 2011, so an improvement of $23 million. Year-to-date EBITDA improved to $76 million, but we had $27 million higher cash taxes in 2012, and an increase in cash interest payments of $5 million. Higher outflows associated with incentive compensation, prepaid insurance, and other working capital items account for the balance of the change. Year-to-date, we spent $61 million on capital expenditures, we've also incurred $133 million on acquisitions, of which $13 million was in the third quarter.","At September 30, 2012, we had $982 million of debt, and cash and cash equivalents for $69 million. These figures comparing the $956 million of debt and the $48 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011. Availability under our credit facility at quarter end was $483 million, after taking into account letters of credits drawn against it. With the cash of $69 million in the balance sheet, our total availability was $552 million. At quarter end, our bank debt was 68% fixed and 32% floating.","And turning to guidance. It's been our long-standing practice our guidance excludes any restructuring costs and transaction costs or gains and losses, contingent purchase price adjustments, capital expenditures or cash flow associated with the acquisitions. I note that we have been, and continue to include the legal settlements we've spoke of in Q1 and Q2 in our guidance.","We increased our guidance for organic revenue growth for parts and services from a range of 5.5% to 7%, to a new range of 6% to 7%. Year-to-date, we are at 5.1% organic growth but there are a number of factors that should increase that rate in Q4. Following that in Q4 2012, we have one additional day over Q4 2011. In Q4, we're going to start recording all of ECP's growth as organic. And at this point, we're assuming a more normal weather pattern than we had in Q1 this year, along with an increase in miles driven. Our revised income for net income is $265 million to $272 million, which equates to $0.88 to $0.91 diluted earnings per share, and we revised our estimated cash flow from operations to $240 million to $270 million. As I mentioned earlier, our capital spending through 9 months was $61 million, so we've reduced our capital spending guidance from $100 million to $115 million range to a new range of $90 million to $100 million.","I realized there's a lot happening in the gross margin numbers this quarter, and some listeners are going to try to understand how these items we've called out will impact Q4, so I'll give you a little color on the things we see today, which obviously could change in the next 2.5 months, but hopefully give you a sense of what we're seeing. Scrap prices remain volatile. At the moment, they continue to be a drag on the business. We saw scrap prices fall in Q3, and we've seen them fall again in October. If nothing else changes, we'd expect to have at least $0.01 of unfavorable impact in our Q4 results from scrap, because of the lag between the time we buy cars and the time we scrap them.","We have seen a drop in the cost of the cars at auction and in the self-serve business. Some of that improvement has unfortunately been offset by the lower scrap. But notwithstanding, we are expecting to see improvements in the recycled line of business of gross margins over the next few quarters. It isn't clear if that will begin to materialize in Q4 this year or early 2013, but the trend does appear to be favorable.","On the cash flow side, Rob mentioned that we're targeting to open up an additional 12 new ECP branches in Q4 2012, in addition to the 31 we've already completed since acquisition. We'll also be looking to increase our volume of vehicles in the North American segment. Depending on how successful we are, both of these events could lead us to have higher inventory levels than we currently expect, which would obviously negatively impact our cash flow, which should leave us in good shape as we enter the busy Q1 2013 season.","I guess it is fair to say the way that Rob and I have been doing, the revised guidance is as follows: Since June, we've seen a steady erosion in commodity prices, which has continued through October. We reported that a drop negatively impacted our diluted earnings per share by $0.01 in Q2, $0.02 in Q3, and we could have a further impact of $0.01 in Q4. With that kind of a headwind, we felt the top end of the guidance range was less likely. The updated guidance reflect that reality as it impacts earnings and operating cash flow. And working capital could fluctuate in Q4 depending on the timing in inventory builds. But with lower capital spending and strong liquidity, we remain in good position to execute our strategy.","And finally, we'd believe the fundamentals of the business remain strong. As Rob mentioned, the alternative part usage, statistics continue to improve. We continue to experience good organic growth and the business continues to diversify into markets that have great growth opportunities.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rob to summarize before we open to questions.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, John. As we enter the last quarter of 2012 and prepare for 2013, our outlook continues to be positive. I'm encouraged by the trends in miles driven, the continued growth in APU, the recent reduction in vehicle pricing at auctions, the strength of Euro Car Parts and the robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities we are witnessing. Every day, our group of over 19,000 team members endeavor to overcome the short-term variables that are out of our control by tackling opportunities to drive organic sales, continuously promoting the use of alternative parts, aggressively pursuing market share gains and implementing operational efficiencies to enhance the productivity of our organization and our customers that ultimately, will reward our stockholders now and over the long term.","And with that, Christine, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Hey, I wanted to talk a couple of things. First on ECP, I mean, obviously that business continues to really put up solid and awesome growth. I was wondering is that kind of indicative -- just of some competitive weakness over there, still in terms of market share gains or is it really blocking and tackling and adding more products?","Robert L. Wagman","I think it's probably a combination of both, Nate, to be honest. There are some -- our competitors are seeing some struggling times for them, and we are capitalizing on that. But I really believe that the growth has a lot to do with our expansion of those stores. We've been able to go after national customers now, aggressively going after the collisions part side of the business too. So I think it's more operational, but clearly there is a component -- have to do with the struggling competitors. But I think our strategy and the extra 12 stores will further cement that and continue the growth into 2013 and beyond.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And maybe just hitting on that point too, obviously, looks like there's some acceptance just from the general marketplace on the collision repair, how are the discussions progressing with the insurance carriers, do you feel like sometime in the next 12 months that we could get some clarity on how they're going to look going forward?","Robert L. Wagman","I think that's the right time frame, 12 months. We've launched that. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and that's proven to be true. We are trying to create an industry over there, to be honest. So the meetings have been very productive -- very receptive, and our plan is that we can get a couple of carriers to jump on board. We believe there will be a snowball rolling down the hill. We'll gather some steam. So that's the plan and I think in 12 -- within 12 months, Nate, we should have a very good idea where we stand.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just one last question and I'll turn it over. But, obviously -- congratulations on getting the system tie-in there with Mitchell. How -- I mean, from a competitive standpoint, that seems to be a big differentiator for you and a really good tie-in to a lot of your end customers there. How are you guys viewing that, in terms of potential gains that you could ultimately get out of that?","Robert L. Wagman","It's a 2 stage process, Nate. This is Stage 1, Phase 1. Just a couple of key components to the program, I think are worth highlighting. It's real-time data now. Previously, our inventory was given to them on a disk, which was 30 days out. So real-time data is pretty powerful. We're getting both salvaging and aftermarket parts shown, and not just by plant but by region, so they'll see our entire regional database, that will allow the shop to take advantage of the distribution networks that we have in place. Of course, with the 1 keystroke to order a part, that's pretty powerful, but I believe the best part of it, it's 24\/7. So the shop can go on, on Saturdays and Sundays and run this process. That's Phase 1 and that's completed. Phase 2, I think, is going to be the ultimate real test of the program, where it's actually fully integrated into the estimating system, where the shop won't have to move out of one screen at all. So it will be fully integrated. We're being told, probably at the earliest, it's 6 months to get that level of it done. I think at that point, that's when we're really going to be able to gauge the true power of what the potential uptick on this thing is. But clearly, we're moving in the right direction with the technology and initial feedback from the body shops is that they are more than willing to do this, if it's effective. So I think this will be the first test and in 6 months we'll have a really good idea of where this thing can go.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Rob, would you take a -- if you look at ECP overall, and you just look out for the next 12 to 18 months as it -- obviously, the entrance has been very successful, how do you look at allocating CapEx dollars? Obviously, you're doing that with some more stores, but longer term, that marketplace -- the viability to spend more capital over there?","Robert L. Wagman","I'll start off and John, feel free to jump on it after. But, Nate -- John, when you said that we believe the total store count is going to be somewhere around 150 to 175. We believe that number is still to be true. And in fact, we may actually be able to go a little bit above 175, with those satellite stores to feed the more remote areas. So the CapEx's planning, we continue to grow and use the capital to expand in the U.K. We're also looking, obviously, at acquisitions over there as well, to help supplement what we've done in the U.K. already. So there's likely to be a little bit more CapEx coming down the road in 2013 and '14.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","All right. And secondly, if you look at opportunities in the U.S -- coming into the tax year, are you seeing that pipeline continue to be as robust? And prices, what do you see with pricing and how badly people want to maybe move out?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. John announced today was a 2 in the quarter and 2 we announced that actually happened in early Q4. We've announced 15 deals and just looking at the pipeline, I feel very confident that we're going to be able to beat 2011's 21 acquisitions. So the pipeline is as robust as we've ever seen it. And quite frankly, we believe it's going to carry into 2013. Pretty much across all of our product lines, we're seeing a lot of activity. I'll just touch on those quickly. For the aftermarket, with the Canadian acquisition that we announced today, we're pretty much done in Canada with aftermarket. So we'll look at strategic tuck ins, again, paint, cooling accessory businesses, now across the United States and Canada. For self service, we're still looking to fill in holes in geography. On previous calls, I announced that we were working on 3 greenfields, those have all become live, 1 in Milwaukee, 1 in Oklahoma City and 1 in Charlotte. And we have now approved 3 more greenfields in the process. So that's going to be the strategy going forward there. HD again, continue to search for strategic locations. The key there is looking for access to good distribution routes to be able to move the product. Europe, as I mentioned, we're still in exploratory mode and on the continent, but again looking for more opportunities in the U.K. as well. And finally full serve, greenfield in the Western Canada. We announced a greenfield up in Alberta. And, again, looking for strategic geography deals, much like the one I announced today in South Florida, that was a key market we were missing. So we believe there's still a lot of market opportunities here in the United States and Canada as well.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And just for housekeeping, John, what was the revenue run rate for those that you announced today?","John S. Quinn","Sure. The acquired revenue was about $15 million trailing, and a little bit under $2 million was actually booked in Q3 related to those acquisitions.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","$2 million in Q3 and $15 million annual?","John S. Quinn","Yes, that was the start of the run rate. Obviously, we're going to try to grow that. John, that was just the Q3 acquisition, it does not include the Q4 items. Just 3Q.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, if I could just follow up then, what was the revenue contribution from the acquisitions acquired this quarter?","John S. Quinn","I don't think we're ready to call that out just yet, Craig. We're still working through a few of the things and they're not entirely on our system yet. We're going to be integrating that in the next 90 days.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's fair. And then to follow up on the Mitchell question. Rob, can you remind us where you're at with respect to other estimate service providers and sort of in the context of which phase you're at with respect to integration?","Robert L. Wagman","Sure, Greg. We are working with the other 2 estimating companies on similar products, to be able to do that and those are continuing. We, hopefully, will be launching something within the next quarter or Q1 at the latest, with the other -- with at least one of the other estimating companies.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then, John, back to you. On ECP, tremendous growth. Is there any way to put it into buckets? I would imagine you've got new stores. You've got same-store sales growth. You've got the impact from adding collision, SKUs, trying to just get a feel for what the overall growth is based on those buckets?","John S. Quinn","Yes, collision is still very small dollars, it's growing though, probably 50% faster than the base business. In terms of the total, what you might think of as a same-store sales, we don't have a good number of that because we don't have the good data before we acquired them, and they have been opening stores prior to our acquisition. I did indicate that there's about 230 basis points contribution from the locations we've opened, since we've acquired them though, contributing to our total parts and services organic growth.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's a helpful metric. And as we go forward and try to model your overall organic growth, should we anticipate something like that, 230 basis point lift in future quarters, related to ECP?","John S. Quinn","We've been very aggressive to opening the locations. This is the second time, I think we've raised the target for 2012. I don't know where  we're going to go yet in 2013. I guess we're not ready to announce that, but obviously these are going to -- they take about 3 years to come to full maturation. So obviously, opening stores in Q4 this year are going to give us a fairly good tailwind going into Q1 next year.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And lastly, sorry, if I missed this. Did you comment at all on the trends you're seeing so far on October?","Robert L. Wagman","We have not, Craig. Glad to give you an update on that. Really, with the exception of the scrap, as we mentioned, was likely to cause a $0.01, based on today's rates. Business is in range of our plan for October, so we're pleased with what we're seeing so far. Of course, ECP continues to be right on target where we slightly exceeding in many cases. But the most encouraging thing that we're seeing in October, again, is the maintaining of our cost improvements in terms of salvage and self-service acquisition costs. So the wild card for Q4 is scrap right now for us. But other than that, we're pretty pleased.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I have a quick questions on -- and one of the Rhode Island precious metals recovery business, do you have a feeling for what the -- sort of the rollout that going from a 40 bp by gross margin lag to becoming neutral than ultimately contributing, sort of how does that timeframe look?","John S. Quinn","The base business is processing commodities. So it -- in terms of that, the 40 basis points, until we anniversary, we're going to continue to see that being the drag, quite frankly. Well, the reason we bought that business was we were trying to get a little bit more out of each car and the precious metals, particularly the catalytic converters. We had been selling the catalytic converters to third parties who were removing the platinum, rhodium, et cetera. So we're going to internalize that, and I mentioned a little bit that the -- we had a delay because as we start processing them ourselves, there's a revenue recognition delay. It doesn't really impact the gross margin percentage per se, because you consider scrap just part of the overall gross margins. So in Q3, there's a slight delay, probably it rounds to $0.01 in terms of gross margin dollars that were missing because of the delay in terms of that processing. So that will come back. Ultimately, we're hoping to get a little bit of extra margin out of each car. And we're processing close to 160,000, 170,000 cars a quarter right now. So our thinking is, that even if we can get, $1 or $2 more per catalytic converter over time, that is accretive to the margins, but I don't know if you'll see it popping out, as I think it will call out per se. Does that make any sense, Bret?","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes it does. Okay. And one question I guess relative the ECP, the pricing environment of the traditional auto parts over there, Unipart. Have they changed their strategy at all, as far as the pricing given some new management, I guess in the last -- in the not-too-distant past?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, Bret. We've seen a little bit more aggressiveness from the pricing from our competitors, trying to get that market share. But quite frankly, we've been able to adjust pretty quickly and maintain -- keeping cash in that revenue and growing the revenue. So we expect to be a little bit more aggressive in the next coming quarters, for sure.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one last question, it's also on market share, but I think it's generally domestic market share. I think earlier in your prepared remarks you commented that you continue to gain share. Do you have an idea sort of about a year-over-year, what's your margins? What's your share increase was, domestically?","Robert L. Wagman","We do know this from insurance industry sources, Bret, that claim losses are down year-over-year, roughly about 2.4% is what we've been told, year-to-date. So, with us rolling at 5.6%, but it's hard to really quantify. But clearly we are taking market share from our competition. And of course the APU usage increase up 1% has helped as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question is on the receivable securitization facility that was put in place. I'm just curious, is this something that you've had in the past? And is there any -- is the customer payment terms becoming less favorable that kind of made you decide to put this in place or were there other reasons?","John S. Quinn","We've not have in the past, when we put the credit facility in place last year, we added a provision in there to allow us to do this. So what we -- in our credit facility, we have a basket that we're allowed to securitize up to $100 million of accounts receivable. And it has nothing to do really with our payment terms, it's simply a way of getting some additional capacity and it trades at a little bit more than commercial paper rate. So on the $80 million facility that we have today, we're borrowing at just a little bit over 1% interest rate. So it's very attractive financing and just another source of capital.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Recently I read, and I think it was a piece put out by Mitchell, and they were saying that OEMs domestically are becoming a little bit more aggressive on pricing, in fact, instructing repair shops to actually lower prices to match alternative prices. I mean, are you guys seeing any of these?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, we're seeing it regionally, John, where we see some aggressive dealerships. But on a national impact, we really haven't seen anything to really worry us. General Motors is probably the biggest one on those types of programs. But they require the dealers to fill out an awful a lot of paper work. We thought the dealers will complain about the paperwork they have to fill out. And they have to buy truckloads of products from what we understand to be in the program. So very few dealerships are actually participating, only the bigger ones. But we haven't seen a major impact at all, actually.","John S. Quinn","And those programs have been around since 2008, on and off. Their marketing programs would be, really, periodically put in place and then they pull back. It seems like it's just part of their marketing strategy.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. If I could just sneak one last one in here. Also recently I heard that France is considering deregulating their repair part market. Now is this -- it's something that you think will go through, it's something that could be replicated in other countries and does this give an opportunity for LKQ in continental Europe?","Robert L. Wagman","It certainly does. France was probably on the bottom of the list as an opportunity because of that and that the fact that they are not going to mandate potentially as it goes through, the use of OEM parts on their fair process, certainly it makes it much more attractive. And certainly, if it gains steam, obviously, other European countries may follow suit. Although, we don't see anyone as restrictive as France. So if France is probably the most restrictive in terms of alternative parts, if they do overturn that, that will be a real eye opener for us and an opportunity as well, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","2 questions. If my math holds, I think year-to-date your wholesale vehicle purchases are up about 10%. I was surprised to see the recycled business on an organic basis only up 3% in the quarter, after being up 8% in the second quarter and your comparison was a little easier. Can you talk about why that number might not have been a little higher?","Robert L. Wagman","Sure, there's a couple of things there that affect that, Sam. First, one less day, it actually caused 150 basis point drop by that one day, year-over-year. Secondly, the reduction in our secure disposal and crush-only vehicles where we just destroy cars on behalf of certain customers, that caused a 50% -- 50 basis point decline as well. Here's one other thing I did want to mention, because of the mild winter, I think we saw a fewer total losses coming out of Q1 and Q2. And don't forget it does take 60 to 90 days before those cars hit the auction, so those were in the Q3. So a little bit tougher buying market, I think in Q3, which we believe has really rectified itself. Looking at the auction volumes now, we're seeing the cars that were totaled in Q2 and Q3 -- early Q3 are now hitting the auctions today. So we think it's a one quarter blip. But mainly that one day, and the fact that the crush-only car revenue was down, really cause of that.","John S. Quinn","Sam, I'll just add, you're right, we're up about 10% year-over-year, that includes the impact of the acquisitions, obviously. Because what we're reporting there is the total number of cars including acquisitions. If you look year-to-date on a similar statistic, recycled parts and services is up organically at 6.6%. So we pull out the acquisition, that's kind of indicates where organically volume sort of 5% to 8% more cars.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second question, I noticed that North American EBITDA in dollars was down pretty sharply year-on-year despite sales being up. I know a lot of that explained away with the scrap and the difficult margin impact from that. But do you expect that specific relationship and dynamic to continue? EBITDA dollars being down, sales being up, how long does that last and what are your expectations for gross margins here in the fourth quarter?","John S. Quinn","Sure, it's John. I'll try to take that one and Rob, you can supplement. No, we don't expect that and due part of it is, as Rob mentioned, there's always one less day, but some of the other things we're seeing is, you're right, scrap was an impact. We don't expect Q4 to be as impacted by scrap as Q3 was. And we talked about the 100 basis points and roughly equivalent to $0.02 in Q3 and we said that's probably going to be $0.01. That's not going to be as big a drag in Q4. It's going to be a drag, but it won't be as big a drag. In terms of -- we did have a delay in terms of the precious metals revenue recognition that we talked about. We started to process about half the cats of that acquisition. So some of that will come back in Q4, but then we may have a delay on some of the other products. Depending on when we move the rest of the cats into the -- that facility will take another one quarter hiatus on some of that income at some point, it will ought to be Q4 this year or maybe we'll take it into early next year, depending on how quickly we can ramp up that facility. Secured disposal, which Rob mentioned that, hitting us about 30 basis points, those things tend to be a little bit lumpy in terms of -- think of these as being, for example, like the cars from a train wreck. So we can't predict those very well, when they're going to come. I can tell you in Q4, so thus far, we're expecting to be down year-over-year. And then the other things, warranty claims, that will get fixed. We think it is behind us now, but until we actually see how things transpire in this quarter, but I would just -- that is definitely a short-term phenomena. And then in terms of the cost of salvage, Rob mentioned that, we are buying better at the auction, some of that is beating up on the scrap. But on a net basis, we do think that ultimately we're going to see our late-model recycled business gross margins improve. So that may hit us and that may start to show up in Q4, we would expect it, if not Q4, we'll start to see it in Q1.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So we should look at a Q4 gross margin closer to the 41-ish percent range, where we saw in Q2, excluding the settlement gains? Is that how to look at it? Or would it be even better than that perhaps?","John S. Quinn","I don't -- you know me, I don't like to give exact line item guidance, but it will be, -- at this point, we're anticipating to improve back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just getting back to the precious metal processing, when will you be anniversary-ing that?","John S. Quinn","We bought have businesses in June this year. So it'll be about a year. But just -- as we move the production from third parties over to that facility, it causes a little bit of a delay on the recognition -- when we can recognize the sale of the metals, so rather than selling the whole cats to, catalytic converters, to a third party, we actually have -- it takes a couple. I think about a month to process them and then some time for the smelters to process them. So we end up with about a quarter delay. So I would imagine it's probably going to be another 6 months before we're fully implemented in that.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So that's the $6 million delay you referenced earlier?","John S. Quinn","Right. And so that will come back in Q4, favorably. But then we may have a delay, either this quarter or next, as we delay the other half of the business, as we start processing the other half of the cats.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So then is that why the precious metal processing is a drag on gross margin because of this delay? Because I would think if you're basically getting more dollars out of each car, that should be better for gross margins?","John S. Quinn","Ultimately it will be better, the base business that we bought though, is just doesn't -- the existing revenue stream of that business is a low gross margin business, frankly.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I see, okay. And then some housekeeping on your earnings per share guidance, just -- can you remind us what the year-to-date EPS was on a comparable basis, excluding the restructuring, the acquisition related expenses, the fair value of contingent liabilities? Just so we have apples to apples? It looks to me like it's about $0.66?","John S. Quinn","Let me just make sure I get the right one over here. Those 2 items are [indiscernible] those 2 items are a little over $0.01, combined.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On a year-to-date basis?","John S. Quinn","Right.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So Q4, if we just back into Q4, that seems like that would be $0.22 to $0.25, is that -- is my math correct on that?","John S. Quinn","Just a minute. Yes. We agree to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Stember with Sidoti.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I missed the comments on scrap metal, the impact to the gross margin as far as the basis points.","John S. Quinn","I'm sorry, what was the...","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","The scrap metal impact on the third quarter, from a -- how many basis points?","John S. Quinn","About 100 basis points.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, got you. And just going back to the guidance question. You're excluding the -- all the extraneous costs, but you are including the legal settlement, which is, by my calculation, about $0.04, is that correct?","John S. Quinn","Correct.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. Great. And last, can you just talk about NSF program? How that's going along and progressing and what we can expect out of that in 2013?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, sure, Scott, it's Rob. We're actually seeing some great progress from NSF year-over-year. They've added 462 certified parts into the program, a 60% growth. And also I'm talking about the certification programs, CAPA actually had 782 new parts entered into the system for a 19% growth. And our own internal program, AQRP, we added 888 new parts year-over-year for 8.5% growth. So all 3 of those programs are growing nicely. The insurance companies are demanding them to increase their usage and we're certainly working with the manufacturers to make sure we get more and more products in. So we do expect continued growth out of all 3 of those programs. Christine?","John S. Quinn","I just want to follow up on Bill's question. Bill, I just want to make sure that we're on an apples and apples basis, because you did not mention the light settlement and so, Scott, has pointed out that we're including the light settlement, it was in Q1. If you include the light settlement, we then excluded the restructuring and -- into the purchase price adjustments, Q4, on our guidance basis will be $0.21 to $0.24. So I just want to make sure that everybody on the call understand that.","Robert L. Wagman","And Christine, I think we have time for one more call -- one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Rob, could you maybe -- with what you're doing right now, early-stage of alternative parts in the U.K., have you -- are you -- you're obviously targeting multiple insurance companies, I will assume. But is right now, are you piloting with 1 or 2, and would that one you're working with, be one of the leading insurance companies in the U.K?","Robert L. Wagman","We have, Gary, we've several small pilots going on, probably number 5 to --  to the number 5 different pilots going on, mainly with small carriers. The big guys are watching and waiting with good interest level, but these are with the smaller carriers at this point.","Operator","Mr. Wagman, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd not like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Robert L. Wagman","We just want to thank everybody for joining in the call today. We look forward to reporting our year-end and Q4 report at the end of February, and look forward to hearing from you then. Thanks everybody. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Director of Investor Relations, LKQ Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Boutross, you may now begin.","Joseph P. Boutross","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results and provided our full year 2013 guidance.","In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Quinn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rob and John have some prepared remarks, and then we will open the call for questions. In addition to the telephone access for today's call, we are providing an audio cast via the LKQ website. A replay of the audio cast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call.","Before we begin with our discussion, I'd like to remind everyone that the statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties, some of which are not currently known to us.

Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. As normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the next few days.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased with the results we reported this morning with both a solid fourth quarter and full year 2012. Diluted earnings per share in Q4 were $0.21, an increase of 10.5% as compared to $0.19 for the fourth quarter of 2011.","Revenue reached a new quarterly high of $1.07 billion in the quarter, an increase of 13.7% as compared to Q4 2011. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 8.2% for the quarter. Total organic revenue growth for the quarter was 7.4%.","For the full year, our EPS was $0.87, representing an increase of 22.5% from the $0.71 reported in 2011. Please note that both full year 2012 and 2011 diluted earnings per share included a loss equal to $0.01 per share resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses and the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Additionally, full year 2011 diluted earnings per share included a charge of $0.01 per share as a result of the loss of debt extinguishment.","Revenue reached a record $4.1 billion in 2012, an increase of 26% as compared to 2011. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for 2012 was 6%. Total organic revenue growth for the year was 4.1%. I am also pleased with our organic growth considering the mild weather conditions we faced in the first and second quarter, increased fuel prices throughout the year, fluctuations in the scrap market, a reduction in claims volume and minimal relief from our relatively high vehicle procurement costs during the first half of the year.","Despite those headwinds, we continue to grow our business and gain market share in the quarter and for the full year, which we believe it was a result of the broadening of our product line offerings for both collision and mechanical repair shops, our efforts to optimize our North American regional distribution network, the ongoing growth in insurance-based Direct Repair Programs and the continued positive performance of Euro Car Parts.","Next, I'd like to talk about other aspects of our business. During the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 68,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 16% increase over Q4 2011.","As for volume at the auctions, the outlook for supply remains good starting out in 2013. With inventory already on hand and a continuation of our current run rate for acquiring cars, we should have sufficient inventory to grow our recycled parts operations.","As mentioned during our last call, we are optimistic about the favorable pricing trends we are witnessing at the auction. This trend played a role on a sequential improvement on gross margin for the quarter, which John will touch on momentarily.","In our heavy-duty truck operations, during the fourth quarter, we purchased over 2,500 units for resale or parts as compared to nearly 1,900 in Q4 2011 or a 37% increase. Overall, the heavy-duty truck business performed well in 2012, posting double-digit organic growth for the year. We continue to believe that this business presents a long-term growth opportunity for our shareholders, and we anticipate additional developments in this line of business for the company.","Turning to our self-service retail business. During the fourth quarter, we acquired over 114,000 lower cost self service and crush-only cars as compared to over 90,000 in Q4 2011 or a 26% increase.","Turning to Euro Car Parts. We continue to be impressed with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to capture market share and open new store branches. In Q4, ECP achieved strong organic revenue growth of 34.1%. During the fourth quarter, we opened 10 new branches, and we opened 2 additional branches in January, bringing our total branch count to 132.","I would also like to update everyone on our collision parts program in the U.K. I am quite pleased with the progress our industry relations team has made since we launched the program in March 2012. At the end of 2012, we had supply relationships with 8 carriers in the U.K., with 8 multi-shop operators. During the quarter, we again witnessed strong double digit year-over-year growth with our collision parts sales in ECP. Though the volume increases off of a small base, the expansion in carrier and MSO penetration is encouraging. We believe we are positioned well for the driving ECP collision part sales in 2013 and advancing our presence in that 3 billion U.K. collision parts market.","Moving onto acquisitions. Q4 and full year 2012 were the most acquisitive quarter in the year, respectively, since the company's founding in 1998. This milestone is a testament to our strength in identifying businesses that will allow us to expand our geographic footprint and broaden our product offerings to continue our growth. We are confident of our regional management's team's ability to effectively integrate these acquired businesses and leverage our existing distribution and sales network to drive organic revenue growth.","As mentioned on the Q3 call, in our total, we purchased an aftermarket parts distribution that operates 12 locations in 7 Canadian provinces and an aftermarket parts distribution business that operates 3 locations in Qu\u00e9bec.","During the balance of Q4, we acquired 15 additional companies. We purchased 2 self-service businesses in Florida and aftermarket parts distribution in West Virginia; 3 paint distributions with locations in Nebraska and Ohio; a bumper and fender distributor in Ontario, Canada; 3 wholesale salvage businesses with locations in Virginia, Minnesota and South Carolina; 2 heavy-duty truck aftermarket cooling and radiator businesses with locations in Michigan, Florida, Georgia and Missouri; 2 heavy-duty truck businesses with locations in Florida and Georgia; and finally, we purchased a self-service business with an adjacent auto shredder in Florida. These acquisitions brought our year end total to 30.","I'd like to briefly highlight 2 recent acquisitions. In December of 2012, we acquired a self-service yard in an adjacent vehicle shredder in Florida. This acquisition marks the company's first entry into the vehicle shredding business. Given that some of our car volume competition, our vehicle shredding companies, having a shredder allows us to procure vehicles that we historically wouldn't buy. We believe that by adding these new types of vehicles to our procurement mix, will lower our average cost per vehicle because we will be increasing our total share of buying in auction.","Also in markets, where there's limiting -- limited shredding capacity, we typically find that we get less revenue per car. But by having our own shredder, we reduce the risk of loss revenue and continue on our focus on maximizing the profitability of each of these vehicles we procure. Currently, this shredder is operating at half capacity. We anticipate running at full capacity by the end of 2013 with all current and future volume being generated internally with no reliance on third-party sources.","Lastly, on acquisitions, on February 1, 2013, the company purchased Autoclimate Limited, a U.K.-based distributor of collision repair parts and products primarily for automotive climate control systems. Autoclimate's products, systems and strong relationships with U.K.-based insurance carriers and collision repair shops compliment ECP's ongoing effort of growing our collision program in the U.K.  Autoclimate marks our second acquisition in the U.K. and our first tuck-in acquisition for ECP, further highlighting our confidence in our acquisition growth strategy outside of North America.","At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results for the quarter.","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Hopefully, everyone's had a chance to review our press release this morning. We expect to file our 10-K with the SEC in the next few days. Please watch for that as well. Also as a reminder, we split the stock in September 2012, so any discussions regarding the number of shares, earnings per share, reflect that split. We are commenting today on Q4 and the full year of 2012, as well as giving 2013 guidance. So please note that my comments may switch between the quarter and the full year's.","Rob's already given you a breakdown of the major year-over-year revenue changes, so I'll supplement what he said with a few other data points. In Q4 2012, our total organic revenue growth was 7.4%, and we delivered additional growth of 5.9% from acquisitions. Rob mentioned that the Q4 2012 organic growth for recycled and aftermarket parts and services was 8.2%. Other revenue, which is where we record our scrap and commodity sales, was higher by 19.2%. The majority of this growth was driven by acquisitions, which accounted for 17.3% of the change. We saw modest organic growth of 1.9% because higher volumes slightly more than offset the fall we saw in commodity prices.","We saw the average price achieved for scrap steel fall about 14% year-over-year. In Q4 2012, revenue for our self-service business was $89.7 million or 8.4% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 35% of this revenue was part sales and included in recycled and related products and 65% scrap and car sales included in other revenue.","Our acquisition revenue growth was driven by the 33 deals we completed since Q3 2011 and excludes ECP, which closed the first day of the quarter in Q4 2011. In Q4 2012, the impact of revenue from acquisitions was $55 million. Gross margin of 41.7% for the fourth quarter of 2012 was flat as compared to the same quarter 2011. There was little year-over-year change in any of our operating segments. However, within the North American segment, we saw margins in our late model salvage operations improving with the drop in the cost of cars. But that improvement was offset by mix and the lower margin precious metals business that we acquired in Q2.","Probably worth taking a moment to add a few comments on the sequential gross margins. Gross margins improved to 40.3% in Q3 2012 to 41.7% from Q4 2012, an increase of 140 basis points. The primary driver of this increase was the wholesale North American segment. And similar to the year-over-year variance, we saw the cost of vehicles decrease more steeply than the drop in scrap prices. There were minor up and downs in the other segments, but nothing significant.","Our facility and warehouse distribution and SG&A expenses was 30.3% of revenue in Q4 2012 and Q4 2011. Slightly higher distribution costs, as a percent of revenue, were offset by lower SG&A costs. This is primarily due to ECP, which tends to run higher distribution costs. In addition, ECP's distribution costs were higher in Q4 2012 compared to Q4 2011 due to our additional infrastructure to support the new branches and the addition of crash parts to the ECP product lines.","The lower SG&A cost was primarily due to compensation-related expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded $200,000 of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses. In the same quarter last year, we incurred $2.3 million of these expenses as a result of legal deal and other restructuring costs related to the acquisitions. Our operating income was $104.3 million in Q4 2012 compared to $90.1 million in 2011, an improvement of $14 million or 16%.","Interest expense of $8.4 million was $1.5 million higher in Q4 2011. This increase is due to our higher average debt balances as we incurred debt to fund our acquisitions and slightly higher average interest rate. Our effective borrowing rate was 3.15% for Q4 2012 compared to 2.84% in Q4 2011.","Our year-to-date tax rate was 36.2% as compared to 37.4% in 2011. The lower rate in 2012 is primarily the result of a higher portion of our earnings being attributable to foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions than the U.S.","On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.21 in Q4 2012 compared to $0.19 in 2011. The impact on EPS of restructuring acquisition-related cost and income was immaterial in both years. So year-over-year, EPS grew $0.02 in Q4, an increase of 11%. For the full year 2012, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.87 compared to $0.71 in 2011, an increase of 23%.","In 2012, the $0.87 of EPS included $0.01 of restructuring and acquisition cost and contingent consideration adjustments. 2012 also included the previously disclosed legal settlements, which totaled $0.04 over the year. Adjusting for these 2 categories, 2012 EPS would have been a net $0.84 compared to the reported $0.87. 2011, we incurred a $0.02 impact from restructuring and debt write-off cost, net of about $0.005 favorable EPS impact contingent payment adjustment. Without these items, 2011 EPS would have been $0.73. On an adjusted basis, 2012, $0.84 EPS is $0.11 favorable to the 2011 adjusted $0.73 or an improvement of 15.1%.","Cash flow from operations. The full year was $206 million compared to $212 million in 2011, a decline of $6 million. The main reasons for this decline and the decline relative to our earlier expectations were in the area of working capital, particularly in the Q4 inventory and accounts payable. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, during our Q4, our inventories increased $47 million, while accounts payable was a use of cash of $7 million. The buying environment for our salvage operations improved in Q4, and we purchased almost 8,000 additional vehicles compared to Q3 2012. As a result, we ended the year with higher inventories than we had earlier expected.","Further, as a result of the threatened port strikes, we accelerated our normal seasonal build of aftermarket product in order to protect ourselves. In addition, we saw our European operations reducing their accounts payable in order to capture additional early-pay discounts, so whereas with their growth, ECP's accounts payable had normally been a source of cash. In 2012, it was actually a use of cash.","The underlying EBITDA of the business was strong with full year EBITDA of $511 million in 2012 compared to $418 million in 2011, an increase of $92 million and 22%. In 2012, we invested $88 million in capital assets, slightly underspending our guidance of $90 million to $100 million. During the year, we spent $265 million in cash from acquisitions, including $132 million in Q4 2012.","For the year, we issued 3.9 million shares of stock related to exercise of stock options and equity compensation, and that resulted in $33 million in cash, including tax-related benefits. At the end of the year, LKQ's debt was $1.1 billion, and cash and cash equivalents were $60 million. Availability under our $1.4 billion credit facility, after taking into account $40 million of Letters of Credit supported by the facility, was $356 million. With our cash of $60 million in the balance sheet, our liquidity was $416 million. Our debt under the credit facility and our asset securitization program was 59% fixed and 41% floating as of year end.","Turning to guidance. I'd like to remind listeners a few items that we exclude from our guidance. The guidance excludes any restructuring costs and transactions cost, gains or losses, capital expenditures or cash flow associated with the acquisitions. We expect to incur some additional charges in contingent consideration liabilities, which can be either a negative or positive. In any case, we're excluding them from guidance as well.","We don't provide guidance quarterly or on specific line items, but I would like to remind investors that in Q1 2013, we'll have 1 fewer day than in Q1 2012. We expect to get that day back in Q3. We would expect our Q1 revenue year-over-year comparisons to be negatively impacted by 1 fewer selling day. Commodity prices create some variability in our income statement quarter-to-quarter. The midpoint of the guidance assumes the commodity prices will be neutral to earnings.","And as our foreign operations grow, foreign exchange could cause additional earnings volatility. Through the first 9 months of 2012, there's no foreign exchange impact from our European operations because they were new to the company. 2013 will be the first full year where we report foreign exchange impact from those operations. In 2012, we recorded using an average exchange rate for the British pound of $1.59 whereas the current exchange rate is about $1.52.","I'd remind listeners that the legal settlements we had last year positively benefited earnings by $0.02 per share in each of Q1 and Q2. Those earnings are not expected to repeat this year.","We expect our parts and services organic growth to be 5.5% to 7.5%. We're not giving guidance by segment, but our internal expectations is the very high growth we've seen in the European segment to lightly slow a bit this year as we're not going to open any new locations until we're sure that the existing branches are fully integrated. We still believe there remains a significant opportunity in the U.K., and we will revisit the branch opening schedule in the second half of the year and expect to update investors at that time.","We assumed a more normal weather pattern for 2013 for North America compared to the mild winter and dry summer of 2012. When that comes to pass and unemployment in the U.S. continues to abate, we'd expect to see our North American growth to improve over our 2012 results.","Also at the end of 2012, we had closed one of our aluminum furnaces. We don't expect any material impact on our earnings as a result of those closure, but we expect our sale of aluminum, which is recorded in other revenue, to be about $10 million lower each quarter this year.","Our guidance for net income is $305 million to $330 million, which equates to $1.09 to $1.00 diluted earnings per share. Compared to the $0.84 EPS we reported in 2012, after adjusting for the legal settlements and acquisition-related items, our guidance represents an improvement of 19% on the low end of the guidance and 30% if we achieve the high end.","We expect to spend in the range of $100 million to $115 million of capital expenditures. This figure is higher than the $88 million in 2012, but we're obviously a much larger company, and we have some carryover spending from 2012 on several greenfield projects that we started last year.","Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $300 million. This represents a significant improvement of almost 50% over 2012, mainly due to the higher projected income and our assumptions that Q4 inventory build will not be as large in 2013 as accounts payable will be the source of cash as opposed to the use of cash that we saw in 2012.","One other item regarding cash flow for your modeling. In 2013, we have approximately $72 million of scheduled debt repayments and $42 million of payments related to contingent consideration. The $3 million of these payments will be recorded as an outflow in our cash flow from operations.","I'd like to turn the call back to Rob to summarize before we open the call to questions.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, John. To summarize, we are pleased with the fourth quarter and our 2012 performance. During 2012, we were challenged with multiple elements that were not in our control, including year-over-year accident frequency that was down roughly 2%, paid claims down on average over 3%.","Our average price per ton of scrap was down 14% and, according to a recent collision repair shop survey, over 70% of all shops reported flat or negative sales compared to 2011. Despite all of those challenges, our company was able to deliver positive growth across many financial performance metrics.","ECP continues to provide exciting growth opportunities for the company, and we are quite pleased with its performance and the value it has created for our shareholders. We plan to continue to expand our ECP branch comp in the U.K., while simultaneously leveraging their network to drive collision part sales by educating our U.K. customers on our value proposition of alternative parts and driving APU. In addition, given our success with ECP and our ability to identify growth opportunities outside of North America, the company continues to explore additional international acquisition targets.","As witnessed by our fourth quarter acquisition and development efforts, we also believe there are opportunities to continue our North American growth. We see strategic tuck-in and greenfield markets available across all of our businesses. We will continue our efforts to add additional product lines as we execute our one-stop shop goal for our collision mechanical customers. All of these business units, supported by our 20,000 plus dedicated employees, allow us to project solid EPS gains for 2013. The low end of our guidance represents a 19% increase over 2012 results, and at the high end, we would increase our EPS 30% year-over-year. Keep in mind that our 2012 EPS exceeded 2011 EPS by over 23%. So you can see that we expect to continue the success we achieved in 2012.","Rob, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Bret Jordan, BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Question on the precious metals recovery. If you look at its impact in the fourth quarter, I guess, its ramp rate, could you give us some more color and how that business is spooling up as you get some of the airbags processing?","Robert L. Wagman","The question -- was the revenue...","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","What was the impact, I guess, the margin impact on the precious metals recovery because that was expected to be margin dilutive, I guess, in the early stages?","Robert L. Wagman","Sorry, Bret. I thought [indiscernible] question.","John S. Quinn","It's about 30 bps net drag on margin.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And I guess what's the expected ramp rate on that? Is that something that as we get into the middle of 2013 and sort of anniversary its acquisition, it should be running fairly efficiently? Will that always be just running at a lower...","Robert L. Wagman","I think it will always be running at a lower, at a lower margin.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And then I guess, speaking about margin trends in North America, as you look more to the auto parts business and, you've certainly done some parts acquisitions in Canada in the recent quarter, where do you see that margin relative to your traditional North American collision margin?","John S. Quinn","Which -- the Canadian one? Is that what you're asking?","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Canadian auto parts. As you're getting more into internal engine parts as opposed to collision panel parts, where did you see a much margin differential between those 2 business categories?","Robert L. Wagman","The businesses that we bought in Canada were primarily aftermarket collision part distributors.","John S. Quinn","And we see the margins being very similar to what we see in North -- in the United States, Bret.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So nothing changing on that mix? Okay. And then one last question, as you look at the shredding business and its 50% capacity and you get a volume, is it cost effective to distribute longer distances, or is it mostly Southeastern volume that's going to go into that shredder?","John S. Quinn","It's mainly going to be Southeastern volume. We figure about a 300 mile radius, Bret, to be able to cost effectively haul it in there. And because it's in Florida, we have such a concentration in Florida and Southern Georgia, we believe we can fully run the setup with our own volume and now have to buy anything on the street.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Craig Kennison of Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, I know organic growth is a more complicated number today because of ECP. Could you help us deconstruct that, and let us know what North American organic growth looks like in 2013 based on your guidance? And then what the same-store sales growth rate and ECP is looking like?","John S. Quinn","Sure. The -- let me put it in a perspective for you. Last year, parking services in North America was 3.6% and the ECP on a full year basis was a little over 50% waiver part of the organic growth. And in Q4, ECP was around 34% organic, which of 19% was same store. So what we're thinking is, ECP has got the benefit of all the locations that we opened last year. We're going to take a little bit of a breather there, make sure those are integrated, all the new managers are firing on all cylinders. We understand the crash business, and that they're trained up on that and then we'll take a look at that in Q -- probably in Q2 we'll start looking at it again to see if we get some new locations open for 2014. Rob can speak to that in a second. In terms of the North American business, our expectation is that if we get to some kind of normalized weather -- and last year, we had very mild Q1 and very dry summer -- we think that those things probably would have been a big drag on our organic growth. If we see the miles driven continue to improve [indiscernible] driving a little bit more, we would expect the North American business to do a little bit better than it did last year on the organic side.","Robert L. Wagman","Just add a little color in the U.K. We're still standing by our projections of 150 to 175 what we call, Tier 1 ECP locations and an additional 25 or so, Tier 2, the smaller or remote markets. With the 12 we did in Q4 originally scheduled for 2013 so we pushed them in 2012. So as John said, we're going to reevaluate this in Q2, but I would expect if we feel comfortable, we'll add another 10 in 2013 to fill up the 242, again, with still some growth for 2014 and '15 as well.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Do have a same-store sales metric for ECP?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, it was around 19% in Q4. They're taking market share.","John S. Quinn","Absolutely.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, the way we calculate organic growth, I think is similar exactly how you do it, we think ECP adds 3 to 4 percentage points to growth in 2013, which would imply that your North American business is growing at a slower pace. Any -- is that the right way to look at it? And if so, why would North America growth rates have slowed?","Robert L. Wagman","I'm not -- maybe we can get it on the call afterwards to see how your math is. I'm not sure. If you look at the top end of our guidance, it would be easier numbers. I think you still see an expansion of our growth for North America.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","We see expansion just to slow down. Maybe we'll take it offline. The next question I have is just in terms of the acquired revenue in Q4, can you quantify it? And then did you do any deals in Q1 that you could quantify as well?","John S. Quinn","I do have that, let me just grab it for a second. So the expected revenue as of Q4 acquisitions on an annualized basis is about $150 million, but we already recorded some of that in Q4. So if you're trying to model it, I would use somewhere between $20 million and $25 million order incremental revenue in Q1.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Does that mean you had over $50 million in Q4?","John S. Quinn","It would be about $16 million in Q4.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","16, okay. And then Q1, did you do any deals that you haven't -- that you can quantify for us?","Robert L. Wagman","The other one, we've announced the [indiscernible]. It is 20 to 25 years [indiscernible], including that one.","John S. Quinn","Craig, if I could just go back to your question about the deceleration that we saw on 2012, I do want to comment on that. Obviously, I think it's a bad news, good news story. 2012, of course, we had no winter. We did talk about that. The Asian carpark in our collision business does work a little bit against us as these cars get older. We're now at 11 years old. People tend to carry less insurance. The cars are more likely to total as it gets older, of course. And quite frankly, the parts we sell for older cars tend to be a little bit lower priced. Miles driven in December were down 3%, just in December. Year-over-year, it was just up 0.3%, so we saw that as a little bit of a headwind as well. Fuel, obviously increasing, obviously, creates a little bit of drag. And unemployment remains stubbornly high. And I think those are the bad news for 2012. I think the good news for 2013 is that the SAR [ph] rate is increasing. In January, it was at 15.3 million. I just saw our report this morning projecting February to be 15.7 million. So that means a lot of late-model cars, which will reduce the aging carpark, and also those late-model cars all carry full insurance so we see that as a positive for 2013. The options are strong, obviously as a result of Sandy, I think, pumping in quite a few cars into the mix, but again allowing us to buy more cars. And finally, our certification programs really just incredible growth. Year-over-year increase in certified programs in 14%. So we see a lot of good tailwinds coming in 2013.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Lovallo of Bank of America.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question would be on in the interest margin [indiscernible] you expect the amount [indiscernible].","Robert L. Wagman","John, you're -- sounds like you're on a cell. It's very faint. But I think your question was, do we expect any margin impact on the Q4 acquisitions? Once we get them fully integrated, we expect to be more or less in line with the corporate averages. When you look what they are, they're aftermarket businesses, salvage businesses, the truck, so forth, everything tends to run. It's a good mix of the businesses we currently have. So it'll take a quarter or two to get those integrated, but then we expect them to be more or less with our run rate.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And in terms of the cars coming in from Hurricane Sandy, do you anticipate most of that still ahead of us? And what are you thinking in terms of the quality of the reusable parts, and, potentially, the pricing of those vehicles?","John S. Quinn","John, they are starting to really start to flow through now. There's a general lag of about 60 days before the title starts coming in. This was a little bit slower because people's houses were destroyed, and I think that became a priority. We really see no real impact to our business model. These are flood damaged cars. Saltwater is the worst for parts because it gets in the electrical systems, so they really don't make good parts cars. They actually do a lot of rebuilders on that, which is unfortunate for the buyers, perhaps, but the eventual buyer of that car. But the volume is projected to be around 250,000 cars. We did purchase about 5,000 cars direct from insurance companies and from other sources, so we did bring some cars in direct. Most of those cars will be stripped down for certain parts and stay away from the -- obviously, the motor and transmission because the saltwater does a lot of damage. The benefit to us, though, the availability in that particular market, basically that New England corridor down into the Mid-Atlantic, there was such a high availability of salvage. A lot of our competitors are focusing on the builder side of it, which is opening up some really great opportunities from the collision cars, that are of course, still happening since Sandy impacted us. So we actually see this as a slight uptick for us, but the flood cars themselves, we generally stay away from, on a saltwater flood.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And if I can sneak one more in here. With the delay in tax refunds this year, have you seen any incremental volume at the self-service lots, potentially customers trading down?","Robert L. Wagman","Interesting. Our admissions -- we track our admissions [indiscernible] and they're pretty steady, so really no major impact there at all.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Wanted to -- sorry to go back to this on your North American organic growth rate a little bit. And I know that there's maybe more math to do, and we can take it offline. Just in terms of conceptually, Rob, you gave some of the puts and takes in terms of the positives in mind and negatives. But I mean, again, with the easy comps, and, obviously, the APU rate going up and all the positives that you do have, and I get there's still a headwind, unemployment, miles driven, but with that I would think that you would have been kind of in the North American side still within your historical, I don't know, maybe the mid single-digit growth range. Is there just a little bit of conservatism, do you think, in that North American range being -- again, if you assumed just roughly 3% for ECP that would imply maybe 2.5 to 4.5 for the North American side, which again still feels a little bit low, but is that kind of a little bit of embedded conservatism? If you could just talk about that a little bit, I'd appreciate it.","Robert L. Wagman","Nate, we are working off of a much bigger base now, and, quite frankly, [indiscernible] log large numbers. Let me talk a little bit about the weather that we faced this year versus last year. It really is a story of extremes. Last year, we had no winter, as we all know, but this year it's just been -- I use the New England as an example. Prior to the blizzard that hit in New England, they were well below year-over-year comps for normal snowfall, and in 24 hours, they got 30 inches of snow which put them over-the-top. The problem of that is it shut down New England for about 4 days. Nobody was driving. In fact, I believe, the governor ordered people off the roads before the storm actually hit. Kansas is another example. Blizzard hit there last week, and, again, everyone was off the road. They were told to stay home. We certainly believe that the weather has been better this year than last year. We'll take certainly, what we are today versus last year. Really it's a story of large numbers now. We hope that the normalized winter will provide an opportunity to increase the same-store sales growth in North America. But the reason why we went with 5.5 to 7.5 was just because of a bigger number.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then in terms of, obviously, the facility costs were up a little bit, and part of that is the expansion from ECP. And I know part of that is building out some of the larger facilities here in North America. Could you talk about a little bit just where you are? I mean you talk about adding 10 more for ECP, but where you are in terms of the expansion in North America in that category, and whether maybe we'd see a little bit of leverage this year, whether there's still investment going on?","John S. Quinn","I'll start, then maybe Rob [indiscernible]. Basically, the infrastructure is built. As we grow, though, we do find that, as leases come up, we tend to try to buy these larger locations [indiscernible] so growth or higher, highest footprint. And so we've budgeted to add a number of the locations, add additional wares and capacity. But you're right, we would hope that with -- if the volumes come up, rebounding off of last year that we should leverage in that area.","Robert L. Wagman","I think John covered it. But certainly, in terms of the acquisitions and the pipeline where we sit today, we think there's plenty of opportunity still here in North America to keep growing the business and in the U.K, as well. So mentioned in our scripts, Nate, that the continent, we are still doing our research on the continent. And we expect to look for possible expansions there as well.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just final question. Rob, you talked about signing up, I think you said maybe 8 carriers in the U.K. on the collision side. Is that kind of brand new in terms of those relationships? And I assume that you're referring to insurance carriers. That was obviously one of the things, as you talked about, you continue to work through and could be one of the big potential upsides over the next couple of years if they really aggressively adapt that. Can you just explain that a little bit further in terms of where you're at and maybe in terms of those 8 carriers, whether they're just small guys are just starting or whether there were any of the big guys. If you could give us a little more color?","Robert L. Wagman","We started this a year ago, as you know. It'll be a year ago next month. We're been very pleased with what we've been able to do. The APU usage in the U.K. is circa 5% versus 37%, 38% here in the United States. So we certainly believe there's a great growth opportunity. Those 8 carriers are small, medium and large carriers. They are all in pilot stage, Nate. We haven't got a full rollout yet. They've got to walk before we run. We knew this was going to be a marathon, not a sprint. But we're very encouraged, great relationships with the carriers. And those MSOs are working with the carriers -- insurance carriers to be clear. Those are insurance companies, starting to push our product types into the system. The Autoclimate was done exactly for that purpose. They already had those relationships with insurance companies on the cooling products so the Autoclimate will leverage those relationships even deeper. So we're very encouraged with what we have. As I mentioned, we had seen double-digit growth and we don't see that ending anytime soon, quite frankly.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Stember of Sidoti & Company.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I understand you guys do not give detailed line-by-line guidance for '13, but just looking at the bottom line range and assuming pretty nice ramp up in margin recovery, could you maybe just talk about on a high level what some of the buckets will be that will be driving that now, particularly with the lower margin ECP business being fully integrated?","John S. Quinn","There are a couple of things. And we have seen some improvement in the cost of sold associated with the salvage business. That takes a while to come through the income statement. We talked a little bit about the fact that, sequentially, in Q4 we saw the margins go up and that was primarily driven by the late-model business in North America. That's one aspect. We talked a minute ago on -- it was Nate's call question with respect to the leverage. We would hope to get some leverage at this -- the bond steps back in North America again, putting more products through the same pipeline. We hope to get some leverage out of there, as well. We are continuing to look at our pricing programs. And I know we've been talking about this for some time. And we're starting to see a little bit of traction on that in the aftermarket. And we made some fairly decent progress on the salvage business over the last couple of years and starting to a little bit of traction on the aftermarket and potentially that could improve some things as well. And we did a lot of acquisitions last year when Nate asked about facilities. As we bring those facilities, where there's duplicate locations in, we should be able to get a little bit of leverage out of the portfolio on those as well.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And then just last question. Just following up, Rob, about the trends that you've seen up like in with weather up in the Northeast, outside of that with some of the other snowfall that we've seen throughout the country, can you talk about how that's trending to your business right now?","Robert L. Wagman","Obviously, Scott, our guidance includes what we've seen in January and February thus far. We expect, hopefully, we have another month of inclement weather coming our way. We obviously prefer smaller storms and businesses that shutdown, kind of shutdown the entire motoring public. But we expect certainly to see hopefully normalized condition rather than these extreme storms. If we get that, we expect to be obviously in our guidance.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Most of the questions have been answered. But, Rob, with these pilots that you're having in the U.K., is that for collision and mechanical and aftermarket and salvage parts?","Robert L. Wagman","Mainly just coalition aftermarket. As you know, Gary, we don't have salvage products yet in the U.K. This would just be aftermarket collision parts. Insurance carriers do write some hard parts, so that is falling into that line of business. And that's where the Autoclimate actually comes in with the cooling product, so mainly focused on collision aftermarket today.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","So there's no salvage parts right now in the U.K. but that would be, obviously, an obvious step in the future if this gets adopted?","Robert L. Wagman","Absolutely on our radar and 100% correct.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of your accelerated 10 of these branch openings for Euro Car Q4, you pulled them from this year, back in the last year, was that contemplated at the end of Q3 in the guidance that you gave for Q4 and year end?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, we announced that on the Q3 call. That was our intention. It was in the guidance, yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Could you tell us what your average price that you paid for the wholesale cars in Q4, and what that was a year ago?","Robert L. Wagman","In Q4 2012, it was around 1800, and a year ago, Q4, it was about 1890.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","1800 versus 1890?","John S. Quinn","Right. It dropped about 5%.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Anything to call out in terms of price trends of the parts that you're selling? Any actions by the OEMs, perhaps, the competitive actions, that might either squeeze or expand margins going forward?","Robert L. Wagman","Not really. They tend to increase prices by 1% to 2% a year. Some product, older product equipment, they might actually drop it, some of it increase. But on average on our product mix, we look at our product mix, it seems to be 1% or 2% per year and obviously  we try to match that.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then finally, you mentioned you're closing an aluminum smelter and that's going to reduce revenues by about $10 million per quarter. I was wondering if you could just kind of flesh out why you're closing that smelter, what's the thought process behind that and what are you going to do now with those aluminum wheels that are no longer being smelted in that facility?","Robert L. Wagman","They were buying some product on the open market. [indiscernible] We've gotten -- we made some systems changes. We've made [indiscernible] cores a little bit better, the higher value cores, and identified them little bit better. We have two of these facilities. We just added another shift to the other one to handle the volume. The other one is actually more efficient anyway. And so we think we'll still have sufficient cores for our own business. This is really -- we're going to try to avoid buying cores that we don't need that we were just melting down [indiscernible] low margin. We don't really anticipate much of a margin in error, operating impact.","John S. Quinn","It's more of a playbill just to get out of the open market of having to buy on the market. Now we can supply it internally and not have to worry about fluctuations in the price that cause us that margin erosion.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","So in other words, with 2 smelters -- your basically had more capacity than your system needed and so you're just buying open market parts to, basically, to utilize the capacity?","John S. Quinn","That's correct. The volume we needed to feed our remand operations is being satisfied by the one operation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line John Lawrence from Stevens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Rob, would you talk about the environment itself to mild winters? You look at acquisition candidates, what's the profile, anything changed there as you look at that group of companies to buy?","Robert L. Wagman","The pipeline, John, it's surprisingly still active. We know we had a little bit of a rush in Q4 because of the pending tax consequences, but our pipeline is as active as it's ever been still, in North America. And now, we're starting to see opportunities over in the continent of Europe. Our strategy is going to be the same here. We'll continue to do the aftermarket tuck-ins. For self-serve, really just filling geographic holes with both acquisitions and greenfields. HD, I announced that we did some strategic tuck-ins already in terms of cooling. We'll continue that. We still have plenty of growth opportunity in the HD. European, the landscape I said, we've been spending a year over there just learning the landscape, learning the laws. We now feel comfortable that with ECP firmly under our belt we're pretty -- we're more receptive actually to looking at opportunities now in Europe. And I'll just point to one full-service like Miami. A year ago, in South Florida, we had nothing, and now we've really filled out that market very nicely. So we'll continue to look on the full serve, just really strategic tuck-ins. Los Angeles is still one that really bothers me when I look at our map. We have 1 location, Southern California. I think we can do a lot more there, so plenty of opportunities still in North America as well.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Lastly, on that, as you look at those, the pro formas don't change, it's still the same returns that we saw 2 or 3 years ago as we look at those potential acquisitions.","John S. Quinn","I think that right, John. I think some of the yards that we're seeing are possibly a little bit stressed, but we pay less for them.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And you get that same return based on facility closures and combinations in that?","John S. Quinn","Exactly.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our allotted time for question-and-answer session today. I will now turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, Rob. I just want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and we look forward to speaking to you in a couple of months to report our Q1 earnings. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines this time, and we thank you for your participation."],"12775":["LKQ Corp.

King & Associates, Inc.","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to LKQ Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. I'll now turn the call over to Joe Boutross, LKQ's Vice President of Investor Relations.","Joseph P. Boutross - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.","Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and slide presentation. Also note that guidance for 2018 is based on current market conditions and does not include any results for the pending Stahlgruber acquisition. We will update guidance for the balance of the year once the Stahlgruber transaction closes.","Adjusted figures exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition related expenses, amortization expense related to acquired intangibles, excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based payments, adjustments to the estimated tax reform provisions booked in 2017, losses on debt extinguishment and gains and losses related to acquisitions or divestitures.","Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K which we've filed with the SEC earlier today, and as normal, we are planning to file or 10-K in the next few days.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We are delighted to share the results of our most recent quarter with you, which from our perspective represented a solid close to a strong year. Importantly, the fourth quarter highlighted excellent momentum in our business, particularly in our North American segment. I will provide some high level comments on the quarter and then Varun will dig in a bit further into the segments and related financial details before we discuss our guidance for 2018.","All in all, we believe Q4 was a strong quarter for our company, and we are very pleased with the results. As noted on slide 3, consolidated revenue was $2.470 billion, a 15% increase over the $2.15 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.","Total revenue growth from parts and services was 14.3%. Importantly, organic revenue growth in parts and services on a global basis was 4.8% during the fourth quarter. As mentioned in the last call, very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth at this level. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.41 in Q4 of 2017 as compared to $0.31 for the comparable period of 2016, an increase of 32%. As Varun will discuss, the 2017 results reflect one-time benefits associated with the Tax Reform Act.","Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which among other items, excludes the impact of the tax law change was $0.41 compared to $0.35 for the same period of 2016, reflecting a 17% year-over-year increase.","Now, let's turn to the operating highlights. As you'll note from slide 5, total parts and services revenue for our North American segment grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the comparable quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment during the quarter was 5.0%. We clearly ended the year on a high note, as the same day organic growth rates for the four quarters of 2017 were 1.8%, 2.8%, 4.0% and 5.0%, respectively, demonstrating the momentum gained as we progress throughout the year. As witnessed for several quarters now, we continue to grow our parts and services revenue faster than the repair market as a whole.","According to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims on a national basis were up 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. So, our organic growth of 5% in Q4, again, reflects an outperformance relative to the market as a whole. This continued growth gives us confidence as we move into 2018, particularly as we appear to be in the midst of a more normalized winter here in the United States.","In addition, with repair cycle times up nearly one full day over the past two years, plus the ongoing increases in the average cost per part and the hourly labor rates per repair, the value proposition of our alternative parts continues to be attractive to the insurance carriers. We are also optimistic about our North American operations due to the favorable trends relating to more vehicles falling into our collisions sweet spot.","Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q4 was achieved, while miles driven in the United States was up only 1.1% on a nationwide basis in November. With miles driven in the Northeast only up nine-tenths of 1% and actually down seven-tenths of 1% in the north central region, both in part markets for our North American business.","Notably, during 2017, our North American segment generated the best growth in EBITDA margins we've achieved in the past five years. I could not be more proud of the effort of our North American team.","As discussed last quarter, we anticipated that the two hurricanes in Q3 would create an opportunity to increase our bidding and procurement activities of high value total loss vehicles. And indeed, we increased vehicle purchases, which as Varun will discuss, added a temporary increase to our working capital and a reduction in operating cash flow. Similar to what happened in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, we believe these enhanced inventory levels will foster the continued growth of our recycling business.","Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders processed through the CCC platform during the fourth quarter each grew 30% and 26%, respectively, year-over-year. So, good growth with this program.","Regarding PGW, during Q4, we integrated four PGW branches into existing LKQ facilities, bringing the total number of PGW integrations to 15 since we acquired the business. I am also happy to announce that during Q4, PGW was awarded an exclusive agreement with Mopar, a parts division of Fiat Chrysler Automotive for the distribution of Mopar batteries through their dealer network, with the first battery having been delivered in January. So today, PGW is now the exclusive OE supplier of aftermarket glass and batteries to all Mopar dealerships.","Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue growth of 24.6%. Importantly, organic revenue for parts and services witnessed growth of 5.0% during the quarter. The operations in Eastern Europe again led the way with double-digit organic growth. Operations open for more than a year accounted for approximately 75% of Europe's reported organic growth, while the locations open less than a year added the balance. Acquisitions in Europe added an additional 11.3% to revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2017, while the strengthening of the euro and sterling during the quarter resulted in a FX increase of just over 8%.","During Q4, we opened a total of 15 new branches in Europe, including six new locations in Western Europe and nine in Eastern Europe. Also during the quarter, we rebranded six additional P.R. REILLY locations in the Republic of Ireland over to the ECP trading name. By the end of Q4, all P.R. REILLY branches were successfully transferred from their legacy operating system onto the ECP trading platform.","With respect to our T2 project, I am pleased to announce that as of year-end, all of our ECP branches were being replenished out of T2. We have started the process of rationalizing two of our smaller warehouse facilities in the UK, with one being closed at year-end 2017 and the other scheduled to close by mid-2018.","With respect to Andrew Page, the CMA released its final findings in early November. And as anticipated, it included a requirement for us to divest only nine branches. In addition, we were finally able to formally begin the integration process of the remaining branches beginning in early January. To that end, we are actively seeking buyers for the selected branches to divest. And we have already closed an additional 10 branches that simply did not perform well during the extended CMA review process. So, we are moving forward with the remaining 80 branches with a goal of having them all fulfilled out of T2 by early in the third quarter of 2018.","We will continue to work through the rationalization process of the Andrew Page infrastructure during the remainder of 2018. While we believe we will be able to move the Andrew Page operation to monthly breakeven by the end of the year, given the delay imposed by the CMA and being able to actively manage the business, Andrew Page will likely lose money for the full year of 2018, albeit at a lower rate than in 2017.","And finally our Specialty segment continued to capitalize on the favorable trends in truck, SUV and RV sales by achieving organic revenue growth of 3.6% during the fourth quarter. To help support this continued growth, during Q4 our Specialty team began the build out of a new 450,000-square foot distribution facility in Southern California, with a targeted opening in Q2 of 2018. This warehouse should allow us to offer both improved service levels and better inventory availability for our customers in certain key geographic markets.","As noted on slide 9, our corporate development activities have continued in earnest as evidenced by our acquisition of five businesses during the fourth quarter. The largest transaction was the previously announced acquisition of Warn Industries which closed in early November. In addition to Warn, during Q4, we acquired an aftermarket parts distributor in Bosnia and Herzegovina, an aftermarket parts distributor in the Netherlands, and automotive glass distributors in Kansas and New Jersey.","The big news in Q4 was the December announcement related to the acquisition of Stahlgruber, the leading aftermarket parts distributor in Germany. We are currently working through the anti-trust process with the relevant European regulators and are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2018.","And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun who will run through the details of the segment results.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Well, thanks Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. Nick touched on a few of the key financial stats. I will take you through the more detailed review of the consolidated and segment results for the quarter and also cover current liquidity.","Nick described the trends behind our reported revenue of $2.47 billion in the quarter. So let me start with our consolidated gross margin for the same period. As noted on slide 12 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was down 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 38.4%.","We saw some softness in Europe due to incremental costs related to the T2 facility and a negative mix impact with a greater percentage of the business growth coming from Eastern Europe, which, as we've previously discussed, has a lower margin structure. Partially offsetting this movement, we continued to see solid margin improvement in our North America segment, primarily in our salvage operations. Segment EBITDA totaled $253 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting a $31-million or 14% increase over the comparable quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was flat year-over-year at 10.3%.","We saw a 50-basis point increase in our operating expenses and I will cover this in further detail as part of the segment results. Non-operating items were favorable by about $4 million versus the prior year. Each period contained a non-recurring income item as Q4 2017 included a $4-million downward adjustment to our contingent consideration liabilities and Q4 2016 reflected a gain on bargain purchase of $8 million related to the Andrew Page acquisition. We have excluded both of these items out of adjusted income from continuing ops and adjusted diluted EPS.","Other non-operating income in the fourth quarter increased by approximately $8 million and includes foreign exchange gains and losses and various other income items such as late payment fees. The vast majority of the variance relates to foreign exchange as Q4 2016 featured negative impact from the weakening pound sterling and the euro, while these currencies strengthened against the dollar in the comparable quarter of 2017.","During the fourth quarter, we experienced a $2-million increase in restructuring costs, compared to the prior year, and a $6-million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, largely due to recent acquisitions. With that, operating income for the fourth quarter was up about $6 million or roughly 4% when compared to the same period in 2016.","Interest expense at $27 million for the quarter was up about 14%, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Pre-tax income during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $150 million, up $6 million or 4.5% compared to the prior year.","Moving to income taxes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December created a significant opportunity for the business and a boatload of additional work for our tax and accounting teams over the past few months, a special call out to them for the incredible personal leadership and commitment in working long hours through the various elements of the tax reform that will benefit us for a long time. I'll split the discussion on taxes into two key elements. One the go forward rate for 2018, and two the effect on the fourth quarter results.","First and more importantly, we expect the U.S. tax reform to have a favorable impact on our 2018 results. With the lower U.S. corporate tax rate, we provisionally estimate that our global effective tax rate will be approximately 26% in 2018. We expect this change to have a meaningful benefit to our earnings and cash flows, and Nick will comment on the specifics when he covers the 2018 annual guidance shortly.","Second, there was an immediate impact on the 2017 financials related to tax reform. Our Q4 and full year provision reflects a $73-million tax benefit due to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. And going the other direction, we recorded a $51-million tax provision related to the transition or repatriation tax on foreign earnings and profits. This provision reflects our current estimates of liability. The revaluation of deferred taxes is a non-cash item. The repatriation tax will be payable over an eight-year period.","The net $22 million benefit related to the Tax Act is reflected in our GAAP diluted EPS, but is excluded from the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. Our base effective tax rate was roughly flat year-over-year at 34.75%. As Nick referenced earlier, diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter was up 32.3%, while adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, a tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and the Tax Act reflected is 17.1% improvement.","For the full year, diluted EPS from continuing ops attributable to LKQ stockholders was $1.74, up 18.4% compared to the $1.47 reported for 2016. And adjusted EPS for the year was $1.88 or 11.2% higher than the $1.69 reported last year.","Turning to the segments on slide 15. Gross margins in North America during the fourth quarter were 43.5%, up 20 basis points over last year. The strong results reflected the benefits of procurement initiatives in our salvage operations, partially offset by reductions in our aftermarket business due to higher input costs.","Operating expenses in our North American segment increased by 70 basis points compared to the prior year. This includes a benefit of about 40 basis points from eliminating shared PGW corporate costs after the sale of the OEM business in March of 2017. The increase primarily related to personnel costs, including rising medical costs and some wage pressure, and also an increased head count to support the continued growth in the business.","Non-operating income and expenses had a positive impact on segment EBITDA of 40 basis points due to favorable foreign exchange gains and losses, and insurance recovery, and increase miscellaneous income. In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $153 million, a 10.4% increase over last year. As a percentage of revenue segment EBITDA was 12.7% in Q4 up 20 basis points from the 12.5% reported in the comparable period of 2016.","While the margin was down sequentially in Q4, this is consistent with the average rate we have experienced in the fourth quarter in North America over the previous five years. Overall, we are very, very proud of the North America leadership team's effort in bringing home a very strong quarter and year.","Moving to slide 17. Scrap prices were up 38% over the prior year and flat in Q4 relative to Q3. The benefit from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing, as car costs will generally follow the scrap prices higher or lower over time. So we didn't see an appreciable benefit in Q4 as the average price was flat sequentially and car costs had adjusted to the scrap price change in Q3.","Moving to our European segment on slide 18. Gross margins in Europe were 35.7% in Q4, a 40-basis point decline over the comparable period of 2016. I'd like to highlight a shift between COGS and operating expenses in our ECP business owing to the transition of T2 costs into COGS in 2017. And obviously there was an offsetting reduction flowing through ECP's overhead expenses.","As discussed in prior calls, we have also experienced a decline in gross margin due to the mix shift in favor of lower margin, albeit higher growth Eastern European operations. And as you know, the team has been working hard on procurement initiatives across the European business, including negotiating consolidated rebate and discount programs with suppliers. And those efforts partially offset the decreases by producing a 30-basis point improvement in the quarter versus the prior year on this specific initiative.","With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 30-basis point increase on a consolidated European basis quarter-over-quarter. European expenses relating to Andrew Page were lower in the fourth quarter than the prior year, and the previously mentioned shift of T2 cost to COGS in 2017 also helped the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Working in the opposite direction, operating expenses in the Benelux region were 120 basis points unfavorable in Q4 of 2017, comprising largely one-time impacts, and so we expect going forward to see a lesser quarter-over-quarter change in that part of the European business.","Non-operating income and expenses had a positive impact of 40 basis points in 2017 due to favorable foreign exchange gains and losses. So segment EBITDA totaled $78 million, a 22% increase over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, this equated to an increase of 13%. As a percentage of revenue, European segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 8% versus 8.2% a year ago.","Moving to slide number 21, the Specialty segment had a solid quarter both on the top line, organic revenue growth and the Warn Industries related acquisition growth, but also the bottom line, despite some pressure on operating expenses.","You'll recall that we closed the Warn acquisition on November 1, with the business adding an iconic brand to our portfolio and contributing financially with a higher EBITDA percentage than the rest of the Specialty segment. You will note that the reported gross margin percentage only increased by 10 basis points. However, the reported figure includes a negative 120-basis point impact of an inventory step up adjustment related to the Warn acquisition that flowed through COGS in the fourth quarter and will end once that inventory has flowed through before the end of the first quarter of 2018.","Operating expenses were higher relative to the prior year, with the primary variances related to higher freight expense in 2017 and a non-recurring benefit related to the settlement of a contingent liability in 2016 that exacerbated the year-over-year comparable. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $23 million, up 13.1% from Q4 of 2016. And as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 10 basis points to 7.8%.","Specialty is a highly seasonal business and the fourth quarter is typically our softest. Consistent with a normal seasonal patterns, we saw segment EBITDA margin decreased 280 basis points sequentially, though it is important to note that this was significantly better than the prior year when the decrease was approximately 300 basis points.","Moving on to capital allocation. As presented on slide number 23, you will note that our cash outflow from continuing operations for 2017 was approximately $523 million. The lower than expected operating cash flow is directly related to an increase in inventory build to support the accelerating organic growth in our North America segment and favorable buying conditions for our salvage operations in the fourth quarter. We had invested a net cash investment of approximately $93 million through September, and we invested a further $106 million in the fourth quarter.","We don't anticipate needing significant additional investments for inventory in 2018, and this will contribute to an increase in cash flow from operations, as Nick will reference when we go through the 2018 annual guidance. Overall, we feel confident that we are well-positioned going into 2018 to provide best-in-class customer service and achieve our growth targets.","Capital spending ended on the low side of our guidance range, with some projects deferred into 2018, which explains a portion of the expected increase included in our guidance for the new year. In 2017, we deployed $682 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $175 million to fund capital expenditures, and the net $507 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. The largest capital changes reflect the net pay down of almost $113 million of debt, largely funded by the proceeds derived from the sale of the PGW glass manufacturing business in March of 2017.","Moving on to slide number 24, we amended our bank credit facility in December, adding $300 million dollars of capacity on our revolver, extending the maturity by a further two years to January 2023, and revising certain financial covenants to create greater flexibility when completing acquisitions.","As of December 31, 2017, we had about $3.4 billion of total debt outstanding and approximately $280 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $3.1 billion or 2.7 times last 12 months EBITDA. We have nearly $1.4 billion of availability on our line of credit, which together with our cash yields a total liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. As noted, when we announced the agreement to announce (30:27) Stahlgruber last December, we intend to finance the acquisition with the proceeds from planned debt offerings, borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and the direct issuance to Stahlgruber's owner of approximately $8 million newly issued shares of LKQ common stock.","The timing of the borrowings and the amounts to be drawn from the debt offerings and the revolver are to be determined and will depend on the timing of the expected closing of the transaction, currently anticipated to be in Q2 and market conditions at such time.","And finally before I turn it back to Nick, I do want to highlight a change that we will be making in our 2018 reporting. After considering the changing profile of our business, we determined that the split of our operating expenses into three categories was no longer relevant to the business, and equally importantly brings us in line with others in both the automotive parts and distribution sectors. As a result, we will collapse facility and warehouse expenses, distribution expenses, and SG&A expenses into a single overhead category. Though please be assured, we will still continue to provide comments on the call and other discussions regarding the drivers within our operating expenses, but also with a focus on the type of expense, for example, labor, rent, freight rather than just the category.","With that, I'll turn it back to Nick to share additional details on the tax reform benefit and our annual guidance for 2018.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Varun. As Varun just mentioned, we anticipate a meaningful reduction in our effective tax rate, that when compared to the rate in 2017 will save LKQ approximately $85 million, representing an increase in earnings per share of approximately $0.28 in 2018. Since the company was founded in 1998, the focus has been to reinvest all the free cash flow back into the business to support our growth. That will be the case with the majority of the enhanced free cash flow resulting from the tax savings.","We will, however, utilize a portion of the benefit to invest in our people and the communities in which we operate, through a series of long-term benefit enhancements and other programs, primarily in the U.S. These include enhancements to our healthcare, retirement, and PTO benefit programs. We are also funding some employee-focused education programs and will be establishing the LKQ foundation as a tax efficient vehicle to support our communities.","In total, the annual cost of these programs will be about $20 million or $0.05 a share. It's important to recognize that while the tax savings will be incorporated into the tax provision, the funding of these important programs will increase operating expenses, slightly reducing the margins of our North American and Specialty segments. But the net benefit is significant with an estimated uptick of approximately $0.23 a share in 2018.","Slide 26 sets forth our annual guidance for 2018. It is important to note that this guidance does not, I repeat does not, include the impact of the pending acquisition of Stahlgruber. We will update guidance after the transaction closes.","As you will note, we believe global organic revenue growth of parts and services will be in the range of 4.0% to 6.0%, with the midpoint up a bit from the 4.1% achieved in 2017. The year-over-year improvement is largely due to an anticipated uptick in North American growth during 2018 reflecting the positive momentum associated with the strong Q4 2017 results.","Also, for those building quarterly models, in 2018, there is one additional selling day in North America that falls in Q4. Again, these growth rates are well above the typical automotive parts distributor. The range for our adjusted diluted earnings per share is $2.30 to $2.40 a share, with a midpoint of $2.35 which reflects a 25% increase over 2017. Again, approximately $0.28 of the increase is attributable to the impact of the Tax Reform Act which will reduce the global effective tax rate to approximately 26%. And as mentioned, we will reinvest about $0.05 in programs that support our employees and the communities.","Cash flow from operations is estimated at $650 million to $700 million reflecting a significant increase from 2017. The increase reflects a higher level of profits, the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and effective working capital management by selling down the higher year-end inventory levels. The working capital swings between 2017 and 2018 are not dissimilar to those experienced during 2014 and 2015.","The increase in capital spending in 2018 to $250 million to $280 million is reflective of several items including the general growth of the business, a carryover of below budgeted spending in 2017. The addition of acquired businesses, particularly Warn, which has slightly higher capital requirements, several large expansion projects within the North American Salvage and aftermarket infrastructure, and as mentioned, the new facility for the Specialty segment. In addition, we have identified a few large IT projects that we anticipate will be initiated during the year.","The guidance reflects an effective tax rate of 26% and exchange rates that are reflective of the market environment here early in 2018.","Slide 27 sets forth a schedule that bridges the projected 25% increase in adjusted earnings per share from the $1.88 reported for 2017 to the midpoint of the 2018 guidance of $2.35. As you can see, about $0.14 represents an increase in profitability of the base business, we pick up $0.03 from the UK, reflecting a recapture of some of the duplicative cost associated with the Tamworth project and eliminating some of the losses at Andrew Page, and the full year impact of the 2017 acquisitions adds another $0.04 a share.","Assuming the recent weakness in the dollar holds, currencies will add about $0.03 a share and then we pick up the $0.28 from the lower tax rate, offset by the $0.05 of investment into employee and community programs.","In summary, the fourth quarter reflected a solid all-around performance for LKQ and it sets the stage for another good year in 2018 as we enter the year with positive momentum. Our organic growth is strong, margin's healthy and the new tax law will materially improve our already strong cash flow dynamics. We have a terrific acquisition waiting to close and plenty of liquidity to capitalize on additional corporate development activities. Taken as a whole, LKQ is in a great position.","These terrific results reflect the collective efforts of our more than 43,000 employees around the globe who are working hard to serve our customers every day. I would like to personally thank each of them for their dedication and for being LKQ proud.","Operator, we are now ready to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Benjamin Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","I want to ask about North American organic growth, obviously really nice results in 4Q, and in the context of broader strong results across organic parts and services growth. We've got a more normal winter as you alluded to, to start the year. Curious about your expectations for that organic growth rate, in particular and kind of the glide path we should expect embedded within your overall organic growth rate guidance.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, Ben. This is Nick. We anticipate that North American organic will be in that 4% to 6% range, with a chance of being kind of north of the midpoint. We've had a great fourth quarter where we posted a 5% organic. I think it's important to recognize that our core products, think about our salvage products and our Keystone aftermarket products, the new products in a box, if you will, they were actually up north of 6% in the quarter.","We are still feeling some softness in a couple of product categories. Paint was up only 1%. The good news there is that's the first quarter in the last five quarters where paint actually had a positive growth rate. And then wheels and cooling our still a little bit on the negative side. So net-net, we're feeling good about North American organic and so we basically included a kind of a 4% to 6% range into the overall guidance.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. And then some of the operating expenses were a bit more pronounced than we are expecting in 4Q, in particular facility and warehouses expenses. Varun, I think in your prepared comments, as you walked through the slide deck, you pointed to the Benelux operating expenses, the 120-basis point headwind, some portion of that being one-time versus structural. But could you quantify that and then just help us think about what of the expense pressure in the quarter was structural versus transitory?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, no, absolutely. Hey Ben, good morning, it's Varun (42:06). Great question and appreciate it. So in terms of talking about operating expenses, personnel costs essentially in many instances in North America cracked the higher organic activity that we had. So apart from having to recruit more people, having to invest further into our inventory, we also had to pay slightly higher rates. And then on top of that, we had a higher level of medical claims expenses here in North America. Freight for the full year was up 20 basis points, but really kind of muted in the fourth quarter as such.","This is again North America specifically. So North America the vast majority of that higher expense really was supporting the higher activity that we experienced as \u2013 on the \u2013 off the back of the organic growth momentum that was coming through.","On the European side, if you think about the Benelux piece as we call that, really two key factors. The first is the one-time piece and it basically is essentially related to costs that get capitalized into inventory and then become part of that inventory cost, it gets offloaded when we sell that inventory, so there was a catch up that took place out there, which essentially \u2013 so that was about 70 basis points of the 120 basis points, so the vast majority of that.","And then the second one really is \u2013 and so I don't expect that to be a structural change, it was more transitory. We don't expect that to be on a go-forward basis. And then the second one is more structural. The remainder of it really is in the Benelux, as we called out last quarter going from a three-step to a two-step model, where we have a higher gross margin rate. But then associated with that, we also have a higher OpEx that comes along with it. The net EBITDA margin is still good for us, and kind of falls within our parameters where we would invest. But there is a structural change and that will continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a solid fourth quarter.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Maybe just a follow on to that prior question on leverage. If we can dial in to North America specifically, you've talked about \u2013 Nick specifically you've talked about initiatives you've been working on for the last couple years to try and streamline operations. And then in your prepared remarks, if I heard correctly (44:37) there's sort of this \u2013 you're embarking on this IT expenditure. Could you just sort of help us understand is 2018 going to be a greater opportunity to show some leverage in the business or are we still in an investment pattern here from North America's perspective?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, Jamie, we're expecting the margins in North America to tick up just a bit, but we are investing heavily into the business because we think there's great growth prospects for many years in the North American business, some of that goes directly to the uptick in capital spending that we noted. CapEx in North America is going to be up the better part of $65 million to $70 million. Some of that relates to some IT initiatives, but the bulk of it is really expanding our capacity within our salvage and aftermarket infrastructure.","You can only push so many cars through a salvage facility before you have to get more land to expand your processing capabilities and the like, because the alternative to actually run more cars through the facility is to increase the cycle time, which means the cars are sitting out in the yards for a fewer number of days and you end up crushing a bunch of great parts that otherwise could be sold. So we're investing into the North American business and you can see that in our capital spending plans. We do think that we still have some room to go on some of our productivity initiatives. We are largely through the benefits, but there's a little bit of extra room, things like our Roadnet and our procurement and other kind of spending initiatives, if you will.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yes. And then just to add to what you just said a few minutes ago. So, Jamie as you think about some of the cost (46:34) a few we know was up through the course of the year. But essentially as part of the investment, in terms of the efficiency programs that we've got underway, call it the Roadnet route optimization piece that Nick referred to, of that matter (46:47) continue to upgrade our fleet to newer and more fuel efficient vehicle, that essentially largely mitigated some of those expenses.","Again, there's some smart investments that we continue to make. And then the other piece that I do want to highlight is that when you kind of think about the go-forward margins, the tax reform benefit and the partial reinvestment of $0.05 that we called out, that is largely here for our U.S. domestic teams, so that will flow back into the 2018 margin profile. So just wanted to kind of highlight that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. I wanted to ask about T2 and Andrew Page. I know in the past you've talked about an $0.08 drag from those operations in 2017. It sounds like you're going to claw back about $0.03 of that. Can we still look at 2019 and say that should be a clean year, where you get a full $0.08 benefit or a net 5% increase over 2017 \u2013 or 2018?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Craig and thanks for the call. Yeah, we are excited about the T2 project. It's operating well. It came in from a cost perspective right on-time, it's ramping up pretty much as anticipated, if you will. Once we get these other two facilities closed and totally rationalized, we will begin to fully get the benefit. So yes, we're going to pick-up a couple cents a share in 2018 of those duplicative cost, and by 2019, we should be pretty well through and \u2013 kind of that what you would call the duplicative cost. And in 2020, we'll be generating some really \u2013 really good returns for us. You","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I guess.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","You got a question on Andrew Page?","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Well, I thought collectively those two would contribute around $0.08 when those one-time or those temporary costs go away, but we're only getting $0.03 of that back and I'm guessing that when we look at 2019, we'll see the full $0.08 benefit?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Our expectation is by the end of 2018 the Andrew Page operation will be breakeven. Obviously, our goal is to get it actually into profitability. And so by 2019, we will collect the entirety of the $0.03 loss that we incurred this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Bret.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Good morning.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Could you talk about the purchasing synergies you're seeing, I think you said 30 basis points maybe from \u2013 on the European consolidation and I thought Mekonomen Group maybe talked about in their earnings call a week or two ago about joining sort of maybe it sounds like a buying group with you guys. So where are we as far as consolidating the supply chain? And I guess as you think about adding the Stahlgruber business, what are the thoughts as far as consolidating some of the management overhead and the operational side of the European business?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","So, I'll start Bret, the purchasing savings that we're seeing roll through are largely coming out of the initiatives that we started post the Rhiag acquisition back in mid-2016. We are getting a good response and good support from our vendor partners, if you will, and those savings are accruing. We haven't really started anything of note as relate with our \u2013 with respect to Mekonomen, but we will begin some programs there, as they announced, in 2018 which should benefit both organizations.","Obviously, we anticipate another kind of step up in procurement benefits once we are able to close and begin to integrate the Stahlgruber team because they bring $1.6 billion of incremental revenue and probably close to \u20ac1 billion of incremental procurement to the overall LKQ Europe network. And we will be working collectively with the Stahlgruber team, and again with our vendor partners to try and really get the benefits of being the largest procurer of aftermarket parts in Europe by a wide margin.","As it relates to integration of kind of back office and items related to the Stahlgruber transaction, that's something that will take much longer to participate. Our goal just as it has been with ECP, Sator and Rhiag is not to disrupt the day to day management and the customer interface because this is very much a local business, even though we have a global platform, the daily activities are local, and we want to make sure we keep our service commitments to our local customer base.","Having said that over time, we do have plans, broader plans to do some integration as it relates to broader kind of corporate services. One of the things we need to do to make that happen, though, is to kind of normalize the IT systems. Right now, most of our European operations operate on different IT systems. So, we noted in the call that we're going to be spending more money on IT in 2018 than ever before, and part of that is to begin the journey and it is a multi-year journey ultimately to bring our European operations to a common platform.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","And then Nick just to add \u2013 Jamie (53:08) I think your second part was about the LKQ Europe, stitching together that piece. So in addition to what Nick said, listen, as you know we have a LKQ Europe CEO, LKQ Europe CFO, a European CIO, things along those lines and that really is the team. It's a small team but that's the one that is continuing to bring together each of these synergy opportunities, be they procurement or cost related.","And this way around, our in-market national businesses, they are free to continue to operate and continue to deliver fantastic service to our folks, to our clients out there. But really, it's a small team, headed by John Quinn that essentially is leading the charge on some of these programs with regards to the common ERP for example across the European landscape. Certain other initiatives associated with procurement, the benefit of which we are beginning to see already, big data, single catalog, along those lines.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, Nick, Varun, and Joe. Thank you for taking my question. I have two if I may. One is on margins, one is on cash flow. On the margin, when should we think about Europe being 9.5% to 10% again, margins? What's the line of sight of that?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So, Michael thanks for your question. As we've been mentioning for some time now, we do think that the European business can get into kind of the double digit EBITDA territory over the next few years. Now obviously, when you layer out \u20ac1.6 billion of revenue from Stahlgruber, which, as we disclosed back in December, was running on a 8% margin, that will have a net negative impact a bit just from a mix perspective. But again, think about the next two to three years. We think we can get the entire complex back to a 10% margin.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And then on free cash flow, can you help me understand \u2013 I get that you've made this investment in inventory and working capital, but what I really like \u2013 and then capital spending's going to be up a lot this year. But what I'd like to try to understand is how does that translate into moving then the organic growth rate? Because your goal was $425 million in free cash for 2017, you did $344 million. Your midpoint of your goal for 2018 doesn't even get back to the original 2017 goal; so I'm trying to understand where the leverage is, because ultimately I think this is a free cash flow play and we've just compressed the free cash a bit.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, so Michael, hey, good morning. It's Varun (56:12). Let me answer that. So listen, as I mentioned in the remarks earlier, given the organic growth in the business and the acceleration of that, specifically here in North America and just to reiterate, going quarter-by-quarter in 2017 here in North America same day was 1.8% in Q1, 2.8% in Q2, 4% in Q3, and 5% in Q4. On the back of that, the last thing that we want to do is to have a stockout scenario. So this was a decision that we actively supported to ensure that we had adequate breadth and depth across our businesses here in North America.","The other piece that I do want to highlight is, coming off the hurricanes in Q3, there were favorable buying conditions on our salvage side. So again that was an area that car buying was good and we built up a backlog of just over a week and that's the piece that we're kind of using through, so we're kind of seeing some of that benefit come through in the current quarter also.","And then to kind of give you one additional example, and if you think about of the product categories that Nick mentioned earlier with regards to paint for example, that had turned positive in this past quarter, glass is another area where we actually performed really well and that actually contributed to our 5% organic growth rate. And again, within that piece to ensure that we have adequate stock given some of the kind of longer lead times that we see and to ensure we have good fill rates from our suppliers, that was the other area that we ended up investing our inventory.","So a couple of those points and then, again these were the kind of main elements. There are other small items as Nick mentioned we called out the Mopar FCA inventory and deal as such. Again that kicks off in 2018. But there was some inventory build on that also.","So again if you think about the overall piece of it, we are in a good position. Organic growth has been accelerating and to avoid any kind of stockout scenarios, we certainly want to make sure that we continue to invest.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Healy with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about the planned IT investments. I know you mentioned Europe would be a focus, but was kind of hoping you could give us some examples of what needs to change from an IT perspective. Are these multi-year projects and just how big of a planned project that you were thinking about there?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, John. This is Nick. Yes, so like in Europe, all of our major acquisitions came to us with completely different ERP systems. And ultimately to get the true efficiency out of the combined network, we need to migrate to a single system. Now, that's probably a five-year process, because you can't take all the various systems and convert it in a year. So, we are in the middle of making a decision as to a single ERP platform for our European operations. That is a major decision. That play out will happen, like I said, probably over the next five years as we will migrate all of our operations to a common platform and that is a very large project. It's tens of millions of dollars, it's not a couple million dollars. It's tens of millions of dollars to make that happen.","In North America, we've been operating off of the same platforms for quite some time. So we're running the business today with basically the same IT infrastructure as we're running back when it was $1 billion business. And so we will again upgrade over the next couple of years to a larger common ERP platform. Currently, we run different platforms for our salvage in our aftermarket businesses and we will likely migrate that to a single platform. Again those are \u2013 that's a really big project, it's not a \u2013 again tens of millions as opposed to millions.","John Healy - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. And then, just wanted to ask Nick just about the U.S. market. There has been a lot of chatter that we finally avoided a green winter. But I'm just wondering if you could give us any color from what you're hearing from maybe some of your larger customers on the collision side, maybe how their book of business looks for the first quarter, kind of what you're seeing in terms of orders, or backlogs at repair shops. Just any sort of qualitative fealty there to (01:01:12) help us confirm or not confirm the absence of (01:01:18).","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","So last year when we were holding this call here in late February, it was 72 degrees in Chicago, this morning, I think it's 29 degrees. So clearly Mother Nature has returned with a more normalized winter. Precipitation levels in the traditional snow states is up from last year, and so we're seeing good demand just as we saw in the fourth quarter. We think that that level of demand will pull through into the early parts here of 2018, and that should set us up well for the entire year just as the 2016 and 2017 lack of winters kind of stuck with us for the better part of the year. We think 2018 is going to be back to a more normal pace, if you will, and overall the tone feels good.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Scott Stember with CL King. Your line is open.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning Scott.","Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Can you maybe talk about the European segment with a little bit more granularity. You said that Eastern Europe outperformed I guess the UK and Western Europe on the continent, can maybe just give us a little bit more commentary on that? And then, just talk about within that 4% to 6% parts and service organic growth how much of that will be from Europe in 2018? Thanks again.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So there's no doubt that the Eastern Bloc countries have the highest organic growth, and part of that just has to do with the growing car park, the larger number of vehicles actually in the countries and the fact that their cars are really old. On average, Eastern Europe autos are about 14.5 years old, and those are cars that need a lot of repair parts and the parts that we provide. And so you've got a growing market and that is resulting, taken as a whole, in double digit organic growth for us. And as a percentage of European revenue, the Eastern Bloc is in that probably the 20% to 22%, 23% range of our total European revenues. So as that continues to grow at a faster pace, obviously that will help the overall organic growth for Europe.","The rest of Europe is \u2013 the Western Europe is obviously grows at a lower rate. We've been messaging for some time that ultimately the 6%, 7% to 8% growth that we had historically experienced at ECP was going to slow a bit. I think that's going to be the case. When we've \u2013 since the time we bought the ECP, we've expanded the branch network from 89 to over 300 when you include Andrew Page. So, we're pretty much done putting new dots on the map at ECP, which obviously the new branch has contributed to organic growth there. But again, we still think they're going to grow at significantly above the overall rate in the UK, and then Sator and the Western European parts of Rhiag again will have kind of probably mid-low to mid-single digit kind of growth rates, if you will.","So all in all, you put it together we think Europe's going to be solidly in the 4% to 6% range, it was at just over 5% in 2017, at 5.3%. And so, we're expecting pretty much a continuation in 2018.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Zarcone.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, again, we think we've had a tremendous fourth quarter and a great 2017. We think the table is set for another great year in 2018. The management team is very excited about the prospects of our company. And again, we've got the better part of 43,000 employees today, more than 49,000 employees once we close Stahlgruber to really make it happen on behalf of our customers each and every day. So we thank you for your time here this morning, and we'll talk to you again in a couple months. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Thank you, Mr. Boutross. You may begin.","Joseph P. Boutross","Great. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we released our second quarter 2013 financial results.","In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Quinn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rob and John have some prepared remarks, and then we will open the call up for questions.","In addition to the telephone access for today's call, we are providing an audiocast via the LKQ website. A replay of the audiocast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call.","Before we begin with our discussion, I would like to remind everyone that the statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties, some of which are currently not known to us.

Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. As normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the next few days.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased with the results we reported this morning. Diluted earnings per share of $0.25 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2013 increased 19% from $0.21 for the second quarter of 2012. As noted in the press release, the second quarter of 2013 and 2012 diluted earnings per share included losses totaling $0.01 per share, resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, a change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, and in 2013 only, a loss of debt extinguishment.","Earnings per share in the second quarter of 2012 also included a gain equal to $0.02 per share that resulted from a favorable legal settlement. Adjusting for these items in the quarter, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.26, which represents growth of 30% over the prior year quarter. I am also pleased with this growth, considering the decline in scrap prices we witnessed in the quarter impacted EPS by roughly $0.01.","Revenue for the quarter was a record $1.25 billion, an increase of 24.4% as compared to $1.01 billion in the second quarter of 2012. Net income for the second quarter of 2013 was $76 million, an increase of 18.3% as compared to $64 million for the same period of 2012.","During the second quarter of 2013, the company delivered strong organic revenue growth for parts and services of 13.1%. I am particularly pleased with our North American organic revenue growth for parts and services, which increased 7.3%. The solid growth in North American organic parts and service revenue for the quarter is primarily a result of a combination of increased use of alternative parts by insurers and the direct repair program networks to reduce claims costs, year-over-year increase in accident frequency related to a more normalized weather patterns, the continued expansion of our regional footprint and the depth of our product offerings.","During the second quarter, we purchased approximately 71,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 6% increase over Q2 2012. As for volume at the auctions, the outlook for supply remains strong and the pricing dynamics we are witnessing are attractive, with Q2 vehicle pricing down over 3% year-over-year. With inventory already on hand and the continuation of our current run rate for acquiring cars, we should have sufficient inventory to grow our recycled parts operations.","In our heavy duty truck operations, during second quarter, we purchased approximately 2,000 units for parts as compared to nearly 1,700 in Q2 2012 or an increase of 18%. In our self-service retail business, during the second quarter, we acquired over 135,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars as compared to over 107,000 in Q2 of 2012 or a 26% increase.","Turning to Euro Car Parts and our European operations. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to capture market share. In Q2, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 37.8%. And for branches open more than 12 months, the organic growth was 25%. Please note that ECP had 2 extra selling days in the quarter year-over-year.","As mentioned on prior calls, we have approved 15 additional ECP branches to be open in 2013, and we are currently on track to hit that target. Of those 15, 1 is scheduled to open in August, 5 is scheduled to open in -- by the end of September, with the remaining 9 scheduled to open in the fourth quarter.","Now turning to ECP's collisions program. During the quarter, we again witnessed strong double-digit year-over-year growth of over 80%, with collision parts sales at ECP. Though off of a small base, collision sales are an ever-increasing portion of ECP's overall revenue mix.","The carrier relationships we've established continue to gain traction. And today, I'm happy to report that ECP has reached an agreement with a leading insurer to act as the sole supplier to their entire body shop network in Northern Ireland. In addition to this Northern Ireland win, we have also reached an exclusive agreement in principle to supply collision parts to the own network of one of the largest insurance companies in the U.K., and we hope to have this agreement formalized by the end of the year.","On May 1, 2013, the company announced that it finalized its acquisition of Sator Beheer. Sator is a market-leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Northern France. We continue to believe that Sator represents a good first step for establishing a beachhead for LKQ intercontinental Europe. Though still early in the process, I am pleased with the initial results we are witnessing of the purchasing synergies between Sator and ECP. The savings are progressing in line with achieving the previously announced timing and financial metrics of those synergies.","Lastly on operation, I want to update everyone on the progress of our intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services and the parts procurement enhancement we began testing early in the quarter with 20 shops. Today, I am happy to report that this enhancement is being fully integrated into CCC ONE's total repair platform and is now available to approximately 600 users of the CCC ONE control optimized and innovate product packages. In total, this user base represents over 4,000 shops. We anticipate the parts procurement enhancement to be fully available and integrated into all 4,000 of these shops by the end of 2013. With the program, shops can view our aftermarket and salvage products in real time. At this time, they can use the program to electronically order aftermarket parts, and we expect electronic ordering of recycled products by Q4. The early pilot results have validated that many in the industry are ready for a more efficient process to locate and purchase the parts necessary to complete quality and timely repairs. Together with CCC, we are the first and currently the only supplier position to take advantage of this opportunity.","Moving on to acquisitions. In addition to Sator, during Q2, we acquired 6 additional companies, an aftermarket radiator distributor with locations in Ohio, California and Florida; another aftermarket radiator distributor with locations in South Carolina and Florida; a distributor of automotive cooling products and radiators in Georgia; a self-service salvage yard in Illinois; a wholesale salvage yard in Ontario, Canada; and finally, a wholesale salvage business with locations in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.","At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more details on the financial results of the quarter.","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As this is our first quarterly call with our new bond investors participating, I'd like to welcome them to the call. We appreciate your support, along with our equity and banking partners.","I will make a brief mention of the financing transactions we completed during the quarter. But since we had a conference call devoted to those transactions in the Sator acquisition, I'll limit my comments in that area, unless someone has specific questions later.","Hopefully, everyone's had a chance to review our press release this morning. We expect to file our Form 10-Q with the SEC in the next few days, so please watch for that as well. Beginning with revenue, our Q2 2013 revenue of $1,252,000,000 was an increase of $245 million compared to Q2 last year or an increase of 24%. This is a bit of a milestone, as it's the first time our quarterly revenue annualized to more than $5 billion. Our total organic growth of 10.8% was supplemented by 14.1% acquisition growth, and we had about a 0.5% negative impact from foreign currency.","Parts and services revenue grew organically 13.1%. And within that category, as Rob mentioned, our European operations continued to performed strongly with 37.8% organic growth. The North American parts and services organic growth was a strong 7.3%.","We saw other revenue increase by $23 million, a 17% increase. We record scrap and core revenue in other revenue. Acquisitions increased other revenue by $28 million. Our organic growth in this line was $5 million negative. The main driver of the negative growth was similar to last quarter as our volume increases in our recycling and self-serve operations were largely offset by lower commodity prices and the discontinuance of operations at one of our aluminum furnaces.","Other revenue remains an important component to the company because of its absolute size and its contribution to the profitability of our recycled and self-service businesses. However, it's worth noting that as a percentage of our total revenue, it's been trending downwards as commodity prices have fallen and we have been growing faster in lines of businesses that do not have a significant scrap and core component. By way of example, other revenue was 17.6% of our revenue in Q2 2011. It was 13.4% in Q2 2012, and it was down to 12.6% of revenue in Q2 2013.","We'll continue to experience short-term impacts from fluctuating commodity prices. But if revenue trends continue, we expect those fluctuations will become less significant to the overall business over time.","In Q2 2013, revenue from our self-serve business was $110 million or 8.8% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 33% of this revenue was parts sales included in North American parts and services and 67% scrap and core sales included in other revenue.","Our reported gross margin for Q2 2013 was $510 million or 40.7% of revenue, a decline of 120 basis points or a gross margin percentage of 41.9% in Q2 2012. The previously discussed gain on legal settlements in Q2 last year accounts for 80 basis points of the decline. The precious metals business we acquired partway into Q2 2012 accounted for a further 20 basis points of the decline.","And I had mentioned on a prior call, we anticipated Sator to impact margin negatively, and that was the case. We attribute 50 basis points of the year-over-year decline to Sator.","Recall that we only owned Sator for 2 months in Q2, so that impact will be slightly more pronounced in Q3 this year. We do anticipate that over the next 7 quarters, we'll see some improvement in Sator's gross margin as we continue to achieve our anticipated synergies.","The 3 items I just mentioned equate to a total decline in gross margin of 150 basis points. Those items were slightly offset by improvements we saw in the North American base business. The most noticeable of those changes was an improvement in the salvage \/recycling business as a result of lower car costs.","Facility and warehouse costs were flat at 8.2% of revenue in Q2 2013 and the same quarter last year. North American operations were approximately 30 basis points higher due to the acquisition of 8 self-serve operations completed in 2012, which incurred greater facility cost as a percentage of revenue compared to our wholesale operations. This increase was offset by the expanding size of our European operations which tend to have lower warehouse costs.","Distribution costs were 8.5% this quarter, compared to 9.1% in the same quarter last year, a decrease of 60 basis points. Sator had lower distribution costs, and that acquisition drove 20 basis points to the improvement. We continue to see some leverage in the U.K. operations as we benefit from the distribution network in spread over a long [indiscernible] footprint.","In North America, we saw a reduction of these costs of approximately 20 basis points, mainly driven by lower fuel costs.","Selling and G&A expenses decreased from 12.1% of revenue in Q2 last year to 11.7% in Q2 this year. Half of this decline was due to Sator, which has a higher sales per customer and, therefore, lower selling expense. The balance is primarily due to a reduction in personnel expenditures as a percentage of revenue as we lever our selling, general and administration workforce across the higher revenue base.","In total, facility and warehouse distribution, selling and general and administrative costs were 29.4% of revenue in Q2 2012 as compared to 28.4% of revenue in Q2 2013, an improvement of 100 basis points.","I mentioned that Sator accounts for approximately 40 basis points of that change. So excluding that acquisition, it could be getting some true operating leverage in these costs in the rest of the business. It leverages particularly apparent when one considers that other revenue tends to require limited amounts of these costs, has been decreasing as a total portion of our revenue.","During Q2, year-over-year we recorded $3.7 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, mainly incurred by the [ph] Sator acquisition. In the same quarter of 2012, we incurred $2.2 million of expenses, half of which was restructuring of our bumper refurbishing business and the balance related to earlier acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization is 1.5% of revenue during Q2 this year and last.","Other expenses net increased to $14.9 million in the 3 months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to $7.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of $7.5 million.","Interest expense was $5.1 million higher due to higher debt levels combined with higher interest rates on our senior notes. In addition, and in Q2 this year, we had losses of $2.8 million related to the write-off of fees in the prior credit facility and a small portion of the costs incurred in conjunction with this quarter's finances.","Expenses in Q2 2013 related to adjustments and contingent continuation were $200,000, compared to $1.2 million last year in the same period.","Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 3.82%, excluding the write-off of debt issuance costs. Our effective interest rate will be marginally higher next year as the quarter will include the full effect of the refinancing.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%, compared to 36.8% in Q2 last year. We continue to see some benefit from lower foreign tax rates as our international business becomes a larger percentage of the total company. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.25 in Q2 2013, compared to $0.21 in Q2 2012. And last year, we had $0.2 favorable impact from the legal settlement. The combination of acquisition-related expenses and continued purchase price adjustments and the loss on debt extinguishment this year impacted earnings per share by $0.01 in Q2 in both 2012 and 2013.","So on an adjusted basis, the diluted earnings per share was $0.26 this year as compared to $0.20 last year, or an improvement of 30%.","Switching to our year-to-date numbers for our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $210 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $121 million for the first 6 months of 2012. During the first half of 2013, our EBITDA increased by $34 million compared to the prior year period. While we generated a greater pre-tax income during the first half of 2013 compared to the first half of 2012, we reduced our cash payments for income taxes to $54 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2013, from $71 million in the prior year.","Cash payments for incentive compensation were $14 million lower during the 6 months ended June 30, 2013. Cash outflows for primarily working capital and CapEx totaled $42 million in the first 6 months of this year as compared to $50 million in the same period 2012. Other operating cash flows exceeded the prior year, primarily due to the timing of payments of various accrued liabilities, such as value-added tax and interest.","Capital spending was $40 million year-to-date compared to $42 million through 6 months last year. We have spent $309 million on our acquisitions, the largest being Sator, which accounted for $273 million of the total.","Year-to-date, we increased our net debt by $156 million. We ended Q2 with $1.4 billion of debt, and cash and cash equivalents were $162 million. As of June 30, 2013, availability under our credit facility was $1.1 billion which, together with our cash balances, provides us with adequate liquidity at this time.","Then turning to guidance. As we've stated in the past, our guidance excludes any restructuring costs and transactions costs, gains losses, continued purchase price adjustments, capital expenditures or cash flows associated with acquisitions. The revised guidance for organic revenue growth for parts and services is 8.5% to 10.5%. We increased this range from 6.5% to 8.5% to reflect the stronger Q2 we reported this morning. We increased our net income guidance range of $313 million to $333 million. Earnings per share has been increased from the previous levels of $1 to $1.09 to revise guidance of $1.03 to $1.10, and we left the balance with the guidance unchanged.","I'll provide some color on some of the things that would impact guidance for the rest of the year, and then we should have time for some questions.","So the growth of our international operations, we are seeing a greater impact from exchange rates for a number of reasons. A weaker Sterling in Europe could negatively impact our earnings but, obviously, a gain there would help us. We saw, in the U.S., a sequential tick up -- uptick, excuse me, in miles driven in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date figure flat. It doesn't infer that people are materially increasing their driving, although if the economy improves, we would expect that to increase. Scrap is volatile during the quarter, and we believe it had minimal impact year-over-year. Rob mentioned that we estimated the petroleum scrap prices impacted by $0.01 this year. I would remind listeners that we had a similar impact from scrap in Q2 2012. We saw a slight increase in July in steel -- scrap steel prices, and we're expecting that to carry into August.","The Manheim Index was at 119.7 at the end of June as compared to 123.4 a year earlier. While we're buying different vehicles in those referenced by the Manheim, our car costs tend to be somewhat correlated to that index. I mentioned, though, in the Q1 call that we've seen an improvement in our car volume and that has continued into Q2. Commodity value decreases are probably still accounting for much of that year-over-year reduction in our car costs. Notwithstanding, we did see a slight improvement in our domestic margin as a result of improved car costs. If the trends and cost continues with stable commodity prices, we may see additional improvement in North American margins.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, John. To summarize, we are pleased with our second quarter performance. As we enter the back half of 2013, I am optimistic about the year. I am encouraged by the current tailwinds of lower fuel prices, the increase in miles driven, continued APU growth, the recent reduction in vehicle pricing we are witnessing and the breadth of development opportunities that exist in our key market segments. I am equally proud of how our group of over 23,000 valuable employees attacked the headwinds we faced in 2012, which subsequently positioned us well to capture and achieve the success we witnessed in the first half of 2013. We believe our unique competitive position both in North America and Europe continues to translate into consistent earnings growth for our shareholders, which has allowed us to increase our organic growth, net income and diluted EPS guidance for 2013.","Kevin, we are now prepared to open the call for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Bret Jordan from BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of quick questions here. A lot of them is as we look at the impact from the precious metals recovery business, that seems to be getting better. I think we were running sort of a 50 basis point impact and it's now 20. Could you maybe give us a little color on the trajectory of that? And is that something that's sort of a diminishing impact going forward? And then I'll hit you with a second question to follow up.","John S. Quinn","Sure, Bret. It's John. I think we acquired that business partway through the year last year. So really, some of that step-down is just because it's only a partial quarter impact. And so that is basically built into our numbers, and we've anniversaried it. So I don't anticipate being the call [indiscernible] in the future quarters. We are still implementing the strategy there, which is to process more of our catalytic converters through that facility. We've implemented some cutting operations, particularly on the East Coast. So we're starting to gain a little bit of traction there. But I think the full rollout is probably in another year.","Robert L. Wagman","That's correct. Bret, this is Rob. We plan on eventually bringing all of our own catalytic converters into that process. And as John mentioned, that will happen over the next couple quarters.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a question on the CCC. John, just the -- I mean, is that a margin impact in addition to a volume impact? Is there anything that changes there as you go to electronic or reformat, either lower overhead on your side of the business from an order input standpoint? Or is any -- is there any impact you have with the obvious volume improvement?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. Short term, no margin impact. But potentially long term, if this thing takes off, Bret., and the shops do most of the ordering themselves, we may be able to leverage that with a reduction in overhead costs. But short term, it's really just making it easy for the shops to do business with us.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Dan Galves for Rod Lache. I just wanted to ask for maybe a little more color on the agreements you've signed or are intending to sign in U.K. with insurance carriers. You said they were exclusive agreements. So I guess, the first question is, so you'd be the only supplier of alternative parts to these body shop networks? And the second question is how aggressive are these particular insurance carriers planning to be in terms of driving alternative parts usage within their network? And how would they do that?","Robert L. Wagman","Your first question, yes, this is exclusive. Right now, we believe the usage in the U.K. is circa 3% to 7% depending on who you talk to, but it's a great opportunity here. We will be -- as I said, we will be the exclusive supplier on both of these contracts. The Northern Ireland market, we previously reported the entire U.K. market is about a $3 billion opportunity. Northern Ireland is over $100 million opportunity, and so we just started that. That dealership's recently signed. So we do expect some good potential work on that. But it's also important to watch that these carriers that we are talking with also do write on the continent. So we do plan on leveraging that in time with our Sator acquisition.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And how do they intend to drive the alternative parts usage in their body shops? Are they going to be auditing them? Or what's the plan there?","Robert L. Wagman","They actually own these body shops, so they will be doing auditing and controlling their process completely. So they will be very much definitely involved with that process with us.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on, I'm interested in how quickly you think that this could move. Maybe you could give us some color on the process of, over time, like how quickly can your suppliers in Asia develop the aftermarket parts for the cars that are sold in the U.K. Is there commonality between the parts in the U.S. and the U.K.? And I guess, just what's the process of going about expanding the offering of aftermarket parts in Europe?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, Dan. There is very little overlap between the U.S. and the U.K. in the continent. So this is a separate group of cars that the -- our Taiwan vendors and Chinese vendors will work with us to develop the products. There is no sign that they will not support us completely. Just to give you some kind of idea in the U.S., we had -- just in our certified programs, the year-over-year increase in certified parts was 22.17%. So they've been very supportive of our needs to keep growing certified products here in the States, as well as in Europe. It's particularly the U.K. right now. So no issues there at all, very responsive to our needs.","Dan Galves - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just one housekeeping just cognizant of the FX changes you're experiencing, John, how does that convert to EBITDA? What percentage of that convert kind of on a similar basis to your European EBITDA margin?","John S. Quinn","Well, we disclosed the segment EBITDA for Europe. It's a little bit complicated in so much as some of their product that they buy is -- for example, in the U.K., they buy some products in U.S. dollars and they buy some product in euro as well as sterling. So it's a little bit complicated, but essentially, it's the EBITDA of the European operations, that is vulnerable.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the tax rate and then some follow-ups. What tax rate should we use for modeling for the back half of the year? And what are you looking for, for a full-year tax rate, John?","John S. Quinn","35 plus or minus a little bit, depending on -- because sometimes, there are some discrete items. And obviously, it's going to depend on how quickly the European operations grow relative to the U.S. one.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the new agreement that you have in Northern Ireland and the one you're working with, I guess, that's in U.K. I mean, is that strictly just aftermarket on the alternative parts? Or are there recycled parts included in that agreement?","Robert L. Wagman","Strictly aftermarket at this time, Gary.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","But the goal would be to also...","Robert L. Wagman","Absolutely. We continue to evaluate the prospects of entering the salvage market. We have challenged the insurance companies there to adopt our aftermarket parts first programs, and we're starting to see that effect. So we're still looking at the salvage opportunity as we speak.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, with the CCC intelligent parts solution, you said there -- it's going to roll out to 4,000 shops. Is that their best high-end shops? Because I would assume CCC has a heck of a lot more shops under their estimating system than 4,000.","Robert L. Wagman","They definitely do. They have about 60% market share of the body shop business. But yes, they are targeting certain shops for this program, and they do tend to be their better shops.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Craig Kennison from Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the collision opportunity in Europe. Could you give us a sense for how broad your portfolio of SKUs is today relative to what you think it can be once you get your partners lined up?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. Right now, we were carrying about 13,000 different SKUs in the marketplace, Craig. We're continually growing that, actually, as new products come on the market. We are replicating them in Taiwan and bringing them over to our warehouses in the U.K. We believe there's certainly substantial more growth to be done there, and we will continue to work in that respect.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And is every ECP store now turned on for collision parts? And are they all performing equally? Are you able to run some experiments to see whether some opportunities there may be better than others?","Robert L. Wagman","All the parts are stored in the national distribution center, pretty much in the central part of the U.K. So every one of the branches has access. Every one of the branches has a trained specialist in [ph] collision parts now, and I think that's why we're seeing this 80% year-over-year growth. More SKUs coming in every quarter, and just better penetration in the marketplace. We do have a way of measuring it, and we do benchmark them against their sister branches, and we do obviously push them to reach certain goals.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And with respect to the CCC opportunity, is there an opportunity for LKQ to invest dollars and training to accelerate adoption of that at all?","Robert L. Wagman","There certainly are. We are -- our Vice President of Insurance Operations meets with CCC regularly. We are actually going out into the marketplace with them to do joint training, so we are very involved in that process, and we have actually committed resources. substantial resources, to this program.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And lastly on gross margin, John, it fell a little bit year-over-year. I'm guessing that's largely mix and a little bit of the scrap issue. But what do you think the sustainable margin rate would be at the gross level?","John S. Quinn","Craig, I think we've talked in the past that our view is excluding the seasonality that unless something changes, things tend to stay the way they are in the short term. And we probably did get a little bit negative impact in Q2 because of falling scrap prices. We did see a little bit of benefit coming through in the car costs on the domestic side. As I had mentioned, the demand obviously went down. Rob mentioned we're buying a little bit better year-over-year, so we are starting to see that theory, if you will, evidence of it coming through in the financials. Then we do have a downtick coming with Sator in the short run because they'll be fully [indiscernible] for a full month next quarter -- full quarter -- next quarter. And we only had them for 2 months. So I would expect it to see a little sequential decline as a result of having them onboard to the full quarter. MST will, as I mentioned earlier, just anniversaried now, so I don't anticipate any impact from that. And you get a little bit sequential impact at having the absence of a decline in the scrap prices. It'll help us a little bit in the next quarter.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Scott Stember from Sidoti & Company.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Just going back to the collision accounts that you have signed or the exclusives that you talked about in the U.K. and up in Northern Ireland. Were these 2 accounts at one time as part of your pilot program? And can you just tell us where the pilot program stands as far as the number of people in it?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. They were both in the pilot program, Scott. So at the time, we had 8 pilots going on. These 2 will make -- go to full program status. So there are remaining 6 in pilot status. As we said on previous calls, we hope that once we started getting people over the wall, this will be a domino effect. So we'll see how that works out in the future, but full 6 left in pilot.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And just maybe going back over to the continent with the torque. Could you talk about how the initial reaction has been with insurers on the continent? And just -- it sounds as if we could see a little bit quicker adoption over there since some of these carriers are already represented in the U.K.?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. We've specifically, obviously, been trying to focus on the synergies and getting the cultures in line, but our Vice President of Operation -- excuse me, Vice President of Insurance Work -- is plainly going over this quarter to start initial conversations with those insurance companies. As I mentioned with the 2 that we have signed, 1 signed and 1 soon to be signed, they do write on the continent. So we do plan on obviously picking -- piggybacking those relationships, but we'll be sending a team over there this coming quarter.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And just last -- just an obligatory question on State Farm. Could you just talk about anything that you've heard recently that would -- basically be off of what we've expected so far for 2013?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. They're still moving forward. We talked about in earlier calls about a program that we're doing with OE parts. We still think that's a good sign that they are looking for alternatives. But unfortunately, nothing new to report on the aftermarket side.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Nate Brockmann from William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted -- just a bunch of little questions and a lot of the other topics that have been kind of bantered about. But in terms of the exclusive arrangements in Europe or up in the U.K. and Ireland, could you talk in terms of a little bit just the functionality of that market in terms of what percentage, if you have a rough number, of all the body shops over there are insurance company-owned?","Robert L. Wagman","It's pretty small, Nate. But they do push a lot of their volumes through those own networks. In Northern Ireland, this particular insurance company owns 16 repair shops, and they will push the majority of their business through that -- those shops whenever possible.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So even -- so in terms of the insurance work like -- that, that particular carrier does up in that region, even though they don't push probably 100% through their own shops, they still can influence beyond that obviously, right?","Robert L. Wagman","Absolutely. They will have their estimators -- they call them engineers over there. They will have their engineers use these products, so they -- we've been approved now.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So while that might not be exclusive to those noninsurance carrier-owned shops, there's still, obviously, a good opportunity to push more through there?","Robert L. Wagman","Absolutely.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the CCC deal, I totally understand why that might not impact margins up front. But over time, do you think that, that could help part of the pricing initiative in terms of there being a little bit more static pricing, discounts being absolutely set? And if so, could you talk about how that might work on the recycled side, given the fact that there's a little bit more pushiness in terms of set pricing, given hours at work and whatnot?","John S. Quinn","I don't think we're anticipating any major impact on pricing at this time. I think Rob mentioned that, over time, it may allow us to lever some of the selling costs because people -- you may end up needing -- we're still paying the commission through our sales reps. But over time, you may need fewer sales reps to do -- making them just to be problem solvers as opposed to handling the plain vanilla transaction that's going electronically. So over time, you may see some impact on that. We don't -- we're not anticipating any real change in pricing at this juncture.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then in terms of coming back to North America, obviously, really nice to see the acceleration there. And I know a part of that was just helped by buying more cars and part of that was a little more normal weather patterns. But obviously, you guys continue to do a good job pushing out broader product availability. It sounds like you guys did some stuff on the radiators side. Could you talk about, like kind of just in terms of the full portfolio, whether it's radiators or getting more into transmissions, how much further you think there is to go still on handling the geographical build-out but also just broader product availability?","Robert L. Wagman","Nate, I think there's plenty of opportunity left, what we call ancillary product lines that touch our business and touch the body shop and mechanical repair. You mentioned transmissions. Absolutely. We manage transmissions as an opportunity. We still are the #2 provider of paint materials in the U.S., so we think there's a great opportunity there. You mentioned cooling. Heavy-duty truck cooling is another line that we -- we're going to look at some more. So there are plenty of businesses that touch the segment that we still have opportunities in for sure.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question is on the strong growth in North America, on the organic side. Was part of that attributable to just the very hot summer we've had? I mean, are you guys seeing increased demand for some of the mechanical parts that may have come under pressure because of the heat?","Robert L. Wagman","Certainly, [indiscernible], John. Obviously, any extreme weather would tend to do well for us. Obviously, snow makes it good for us, but extreme heat will cause a lot of engine failure over time, so really hard to gauge, specifically if it's tied to heat or it's tied to the fact that these -- there's an older model of your car in the United States. The average model of your car is well over 11 years now, so that may have some impact on it, too. But certainly, extreme weather conditions are never a bad thing for our business.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And then in terms of the outlook, you guys brought the revenue and net income outlook up. You kept the cash flow unchanged. Is there any reasoning for that? I mean, is there any working capital headwinds that you're expecting in addition to what you were thinking about before?","John S. Quinn","Just perhaps in -- a little bit more inventory build in the back half of the year, we had some lower tax payments earlier in the year, and those come out for the balance of the year. And it's mainly just working capital swings, nothing -- which I wouldn't take anything out away from that.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then final question is on the 6 acquisitions outside of Sator. Do you have a trailing 12-month revenue number for us?","John S. Quinn","We do. In the quarter, the total acquisitions revenue trailing was about $400 million, and just [indiscernible] modeling a little bit, so that will be about $100 million a quarter. Within the Q2, we reported $72 million of that $100 million. So in Q3, we'd expect the carryover impact from Q2 acquisitions to be about an incremental $28 million in Q3.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Bill Armstrong from CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I want to drill down a little bit on the big organic growth in the U.K., 37.8%. Did I hear you say earlier that 25% of that was same store?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, that's correct.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And there were 2 extra business days?","Robert L. Wagman","2 extra selling days in the quarter, yes.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if we adjust for that, what would the same-store sales have been?","Robert L. Wagman","We're doing the math now, roughly 20%.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that -- so even if you make those adjustments, you still had a really strong quarter. I mean, is that -- from the supply range [indiscernible] was talking about? Or were there other things going on that helped that number?","John S. Quinn","It's a combination of the things, Bill. One is that you do get -- it takes about 3 years for the new location to build up. So some of this is what you're seeing in locations that they open prior to our acquisition and then the aggressive opening program that we instituted once we opened them. You're also seeing an impact a little bit of some of the new product lines that we've added in terms of for collision [ph] , for example, it's just growing faster. And it's still very small, but it's growing faster than the business as a whole.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my other question regarded interest expense. That $12.5 million, was there any -- were there any nonrecurring items within that $12.5 million?","John S. Quinn","No. Against modeling, keep in mind, we only had that facility in place and ventured for 2 months. So you should anticipate the interest expense for the -- the bond in particular for an extra month, it's probably going to increase. The interest in Q3, my guess, we estimate somewhere between $2 million and $3 million.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So maybe about a $15 million quarterly run rate for modeling?","John S. Quinn","That's in line with what we're thinking. It's obviously barring any major acquisition there.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right, right, based on what we've got right now.","John S. Quinn","Exactly.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Lawrence from Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes, Rob, would you comment just a little bit on North America a little bit and put it in the context of fuel rates? When you talk about depth of coverage and regional, what did the -- I guess, the pilot tell you about fuel rates on an electronic basis going forward.","Robert L. Wagman","Fuel rates remain strong, John. Salvage is in the mid 70s. Aftermarket is in the mid-90s, and just maintaining very good. As far as the connection to the CCC pilot, I think what you're referring to is live real-time inventory. So these shops are seeing the inventory. It's updated constantly, so they can get a real accurate picture of the inventory. It's 24\/7 as well. So if they happen to be open on Saturdays or Sundays or late at night because of a hailstorm perhaps, they can see the inventories. So it really, certainly, has helped to make them more comfortable. [ph]","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","It's a major change. Yes.","Robert L. Wagman","And as you know, we have regional distribution. So we certainly -- they're seeing all that inventory in that entire region within 24 hours. So it's very live, and it is -- aftermarket is really providing that opportunity for us today.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So we can certainly move that rate up a little bit over time?","Robert L. Wagman","Which rate? The fuel rate?","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","The fuel rates, yes, overall.","Robert L. Wagman","I think they'll remain pretty steady with the inventory we have in place now.","John S. Quinn","We measure fill rate by -- if the customer calls, do we -- are we able to get them the product within 24 hours? So this is not necessarily going to change that percentage. So I think what -- some of the benefits you see is that the customer saves time making it easier for them because they're ordering it, and not going through one of our people is maybe one less area for error, so we anticipate a little bit of an improvement in sort of our return rates, for example. So we may see some efficiencies overall. But the pilot was also good from our perspective, and we're very happy to get all of this done.","Robert L. Wagman","It is possible that shops may realize some overhead savings, too, because they may be able to have the estimator also do the ordering as well at the same time. So there may be some benefits for them on top of the fact that they're more efficient.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Right. And the second question is, if you look at the overall distribution network both in the U.K. and the continent, how does all that flow together? And what's the plans, aside from Wembley and some of those other facilities and leverage points going forward?","John S. Quinn","Yes, we're going to continue to build it. In fact, when we talked earlier about additional branch openings in the U.K. We've targeted 15 for the balance of this year. That will take us up to circa 147. We think the right number is probably somewhere in 175 to 200 for what we consider a full branch, and then there will be some satellite opportunities in addition to that. Over time, as we grow that, we're going to have to look at the infrastructure associated with that regional hubs and the 2 main central hubs. Because, obviously, we've been growing that business so quickly. You may end up at borrowing capacity there. We're looking at projects right now just to understand exactly if there's any opportunities to rationalize any of the warehousing and the distribution logistics between the U.K. operations and some of the continental operations. Obviously, it carries a lot some of our product. You can get a product across the channel on a ferry within a couple of hours, so it's almost like they're in one remote location in terms of that. So we're examining some of that -- much too early days to make any predictions and objectives where that's going to come out.","Robert L. Wagman","And John, I just want to add that we are already having daily delivery back-and-forth from the U.K. to Schiedam, the Netherlands.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from James Albertine from Stifel.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I wanted to focus on 2 sort of M&A-related questions. First, you gave a great color intra-quarter on the Sator acquisition, and you had an outlook as of the beginning of May as to when you thought that -- how that business would mature over time. Just wanted to get a sense -- obviously, we only got 2 months behind us now since that conversation. But any learnings that you picked up incrementally that makes you feel better or worse about that trajectory that you laid out in May? And then a quick follow-up on the U.S. deal.","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, Jamie. The -- we're very pleased with the acquisition, as we've mentioned on previous calls, but the primary focus has been on synergies and purchasing synergies. The teams are in lockstep on that. The other goal is to get the distribution between the 2 facilities up and running. We've accomplished that as well. So we're very pleased with the targets that we were hitting already, and well on pace to hit the timeline that we originally set out a couple of months ago. So really no surprises at all as far as what we wanted to get done and where we're headed.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And then very quickly on the U.S. side. You guys majored in M&A and minored in meteorology, I guess. Buying radiator companies in front of a hot summer like this is nothing short of being a prophet. So I wanted to get a sense. As the market's recovering, though, what you're seeing in terms of the quality and quantity of deals out there, but perhaps more importantly, are you seeing any difference from a valuation perspective as the market's sort of recovering overall?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. We honestly did expect a little bit of a lighter year this year because of the tax implications that ended in 2012 capital gains. It has not slowed down. Our M&A team has been busy as they've ever been. We've announced 11 deals to-date now, so we knew 30 going to -- actually, we did 30 deals. We didn't expect to do 30 deals this year. If you just extrapolate, we're heading on a pace of 22. So really in line -- slightly ahead of where we expected. I didn't expect it to be as robust as it is, but it's across all of our divisions, too, heavy truck. As you saw, it was quite a mix, and those 7 acquisitions we announced today of cooling aftermarket -- into the aftermarket division, self-service and full-service. So all of our product lines still remain active with acquisition candidates, and I expect to that to continue for the balance of the year.","John S. Quinn","And in terms of valuation, in many cases, there are other companies that we're buying are family-owned businesses that are coming to some kind of a family event, and we have really not changed our valuation metrics. Many of these companies, we're the only one buying them. And so it's really -- we're competing against somebody who continue to run the business until they retire. And so we haven't really had to change our valuation metrics on many of these smaller deals that we do.","Robert L. Wagman","We would like to be respectful of everyone's time. So calling off the call. Thank you, all, for joining the call. We look forward to updating you on our Q3 performance in October. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"12904":["LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) Q4 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call February 20, 2020  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Joe Boutross - Vice President of Investor Relations","Nick Zarcone - President and Chief Executive Officer","Varun Laroyia - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Daniel Imbro - Stephens Inc","Stephanie Benjamin - SunTrust","Craig Kennison - Baird","Michael Hoffman - Stifel","Bret Jordan - Jefferies","Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research","Scott Stember - C.L.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would like to turn the call over to Joe Boutross, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Joe Boutross","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to LKQ's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are, Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Varun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-K in the next few days.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.","Nick Zarcone","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and then Varun will dive into the financial details and 2020 guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks.","Q4 was a strong quarter for our company, and we are very pleased with the results. As we mentioned at the outset of 2019, we were focused on a few key initiatives, and I am proud to say our segment teams have embraced and executed on each. There is more opportunity ahead, and we will continue to work hard to move the company forward.","Let me reiterate the key initiatives, which continue to be central to our culture and objectives as we've entered 2020. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model.","For example, in 2019, we launched our 1 LKQ Europe program and provided a clear road map to drive the business to double-digit EBITDA margins. Additionally, in 2019, we divested our airplane recycling business and merged auto Kelly Bulgaria with a competitor, thereby removing a couple of low-margin non-core businesses from our lineup and freeing up management time.","Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. In 2019, we were able to grow margins despite facing low revenue growth and macro headwinds in Europe, with our teams doing an exceptional job of addressing costs with their productivity efforts. North America, in particular, witnessed year-over-year improvement in segment EBITDA margins of 100 basis points in 2019.","Third, we will continue to drive higher levels of cash flow which, in turn, will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. In 2019, we generated record cash flow from operations of over $1 billion and free cash flow of nearly $800 million, reflecting year-over-year increases of 50% and 73%, respectively. Last year, we paid off $301 million worth of debt and repurchased 10.9 million shares of our stock for over $290 million.","And fourth, we have and will continue to invest in our future. In 2019, we made two strategic acquisitions in the automotive diagnostic space, which positions our North American business to be at the forefront of this rapidly growing market opportunity and will allow us to continue expanding our customer offerings.","As noted on Slide 5, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $3 billion, reflecting growth of 0.2%, a slight increase from what was recorded in the comparable period of 2018.","Parts and Services organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter was 0.9%. Acquisitions added 20 basis points of growth, while currencies had a negative impact of 1%, for total parts and services revenue growth of 0.1%.","Net income during Q4 was $140 million compared to $40 million for the same period of last year, an increase of 247% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.46 compared to $0.13 for the same period of 2018, an increase of 254% year-over-year.","On an adjusted basis, net income was $167 million, an increase of 10% compared to the $151 million for the same period of last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.54 compared to $0.48 for the same period of 2018, a 13% increase. We are again pleased with the level of EPS growth considering the marginal uptick in revenue.","Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 7, organic revenue growth for parts and services in our North American segment was 2.5% in the quarter. This organic performance includes a benefit from the GM strike, which was partially offset by declines in our glass and heavy-duty truck businesses. Excluding these dynamics, organic growth would have been 1.3%.","We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that, according to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims decreased 1% in the fourth quarter. Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q4 was achieved while miles driven in the U.S. were down 0.1% year-over-year in November.","Related to our recycling businesses, I am proud of the impressive environmental efforts of our North American team in 2019. Between our full service and self-service salvage businesses, during the year, we processed over 887,000 vehicles, resulting in, among other things, the recycling of 4.2 million gallons of fuel, 2.6 million gallons of waste oil, 2.5 million tires and 630,000 batteries, all reflecting solid increases over 2018. This effort is a key pillar of our mission of being a responsible steward of the environment and a true partner with the communities in which we operate.","We also continue to grow our parts offerings with aftermarket collision SKU offerings and the total number of certified parts available growing 4.9% and 10.0%, respectively, in 2019.","Lastly, on North America, during the quarter, we continued the development of our mobile app-based delivery manifest management system, which we call InTouch Mobile. InTouch Mobile is a proprietary, internally developed platform that will automate delivery management and route accounting procedures that we are converting from a manual to paperless process. InTouch Mobile will also enhance the customer service experience, improve route and driver efficiencies and simplify various accounting functions. We are excited about this implementation and optimistic about the potential productivity it will generate. At the end of Q4, 85% of our full service and aftermarket locations were live on the system.","Moving to our European segment. Organic growth for parts and services in the fourth quarter was 1.2%. Acquisitions in Europe added 0.7% of revenue growth, while the strong dollar resulted in a negative impact of 2%. As noted by other public companies with European exposure, the soft economic backdrop continues to create an industry headwind. Indeed, our performance on a relative basis appears to be strong, which gives us confidence that we continue to take market share.","While we don't disclose country-by-country detail in the fourth quarter, we witnessed positive organic revenue growth in each of our markets in which we operate, except for Germany and Italy.","As it relates to the 1 LKQ Europe program, we continue to gain operational momentum on multiple fronts, and the segment is performing in line with the metrics and multi-year plan we set forth last September. As I've stated in the past, talent acquisition and to build out our organizational structure is a key component to implementing our 1 LKQ Europe program. And in Q4, we made very good progress on the talent front.","Going forward, we are implementing a recently announced European organizational structure of key functional departments, including private label, which we are now calling components, product management and procurement, supply chain and information technology.","On the operational side, we have announced both a new CEO for Rhiag, Italy, who came from the outside, and the promotion of an internal person to lead the Stahlgruber organization.","On the corporate side, we have announced the recruitment of a human resources leader for all of Europe and also appointed leaders for information technology, product management, procurement and components. The implementation of these strategies will promote the harmonization of processes and infrastructure, the implementation of best practices and the establishment of common standards in each of the functions. We believe this will position the business to achieve better results, make faster and better decisions and work more efficiently.","Supporting the organizational structure, in Q4, we identified Zug, Switzerland as the future home of our European segment corporate office. We expect to officially open the office in mid-2020.","With a key initiative of investing in our future, we began the construction of our new central distribution center for our Fource business in the Benelux region. Located in the Netherlands, this new facility will enable us to consolidate the activities of five small existing distribution centers into a single location, which will have automation similar to that found at T2 in the U.K. and Sulzbach-Rosenberg, in Germany, albeit on a slightly smaller scale.","Regarding Brexit, our U.K. operations have taken necessary precautions to protect the interest of our customers for every milestone of this exit process. We have a sufficiently deep inventory from European and Asian suppliers, strong supply processes and significant measures in place to provide our customers with the service they expect from us even in the face of Britain's recent departure announcement from the common market.","In fact, we believe the size of our business and its industry-leading processes will enable us to continue to expand our market share in the U. K. and the Republic of Ireland, acting as a key partner for our customers even in the face of what could be a momentous change.","As Europe has become a larger portion of our global revenue and is a part of our board's ongoing director refreshment process, on December 6, we announced the addition of Xavier Urbain to our Board of Directors. As the former Group Chief Executive Officer of Netherlands based CEVA Logistics, Xavier's experience with building a global business across both developed and emerging market will add tremendous value at the board level into our operating teams as we continue to execute on the 1 LKQ Europe program. Lastly, in Q4, we opened three new branches in Eastern Europe and two new branches in Western Europe.","Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the fourth quarter, Specialty reported a total revenue decrease of 6%, a performance well below our expectations. The primary drivers for this decline were twofold.","First, two major suppliers altered their go-to-market strategies, which essentially bypassed wholesale distributors for a portion of their volumes. We believe these are isolated cases and not reflective of a broader trend.","Second, in the fourth quarter, a few companies who use our specialty unit to fulfill orders they received through online marketplaces witnessed impactful interruptions during the critical selling period of late November and December. These interruptions were related to these companies having their sales halted temporarily due to intellectual property complaints submitted to the marketplace facilitators.","Today, these companies have had varying degrees of success, countering those claims in getting back online. Confronted with these headwinds, our specialty team is aggressively seeking new business by expanding our product line and targeting new and relevant customers.","Additionally, specialty continues to focus on measures to right-size their cost structure given the top line challenges, hoping to offset some of the reduction in EBITDA margin.","At the 2019 SEMA Show, Warn announced that Ford Motor Company is offering a Warn winch for it's 2020 F-250 and F-350 Super Duty trucks. These new winches will be available as a factory- orderable option or a dealer-installed after sale accessory on properly equipped Super Duty models beginning in mid-2020.","Additionally, at the Chicago Auto Show this month Jeep announced that the new limited addition 2020 Jeep Wrangler JPP 20 is equipped with a Warn Rubicon Zeon Winch along with Warn's proprietary Spydura Rope. As was announced at Specialties RV Expo last month, we continue to expand our RV OEM warranty program with the addition of Winnebago, a rapid adoption of our OE warranty program offerings to top tier manufacturers is a clear validation of our unrivaled distribution network in customer service capabilities. There was a relatively quiet quarter from a corporate development perspective, we closed on two transactions in the US, a diagnostic and repair service provider in a niche business that manufacturers and distributes replacements and labels, with a total net consideration of $13 million.","In addition, we announced the execution of a definitive agreement to sell the company's equity interest in two Czech Republic wholesale automotive parts distributors, and that's pending regulatory approval.","Finally, as you are aware, the coronavirus has generated significant headlines, which has led to many questions regarding our supply chain. First, I'd like to say that, on behalf of LKQ, our thoughts go out to all those impacted by the virus.","Clearly, with this outbreak, everyone is in uncharted waters, and it is simply too early to say what interruption companies could face across the business world. The coronavirus outbreak occurred just prior to the Chinese New Year. As a normal course of business and anticipating the annual shutdown related to the Chinese holiday, we had already procured and received most of the Chinese manufactured products needed for the first quarter.","Importantly, our segment teams are proactively monitoring the situation and are in constant dialogue with our supply chain partners to help assure we maintain continuity in our operations and effectively manage the inventory levels we need to service our customers.","And I will now turn the discussion over to Varun, who will run you through the details of the segment results and discuss our 2020 guidance.","Varun Laroyia","Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. Overall, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance, as it relates to progress in our key financial priorities of profitable revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation.","Resetting the team's focus to these priorities, while implementing large-scale changes to our compensation plans was a formidable task, and we are incredibly pleased with how quickly the organization adapted to these progressive changes to deliver solid results in 2019.","With North America in a strong position and the 1 LKQ Europe program picking up momentum, we are excited about our prospects for 2020 and beyond. Before diving into the results, let's start with the key financial highlights.","The consolidated segment EBITDA margin for Q4 improved 80 basis points relative to the prior year. This was led by the North America segment, which not only generated the highest fourth quarter margin in the previous 5 years, but the highest by 120 basis points.","Europe and Specialty were roughly flat, although Europe faced a 30 basis point headwind from transformation expenses. Q4 was a relatively low revenue growth quarter, so the ability to maintain or grow margins speaks to the improved resilience of the business.","The restructuring programs we implemented earlier in the year have certainly helped in this regard and helped kick start the focus on costs and productivity. As we guided last quarter, after a couple of historically high quarters of cash flow generation, the expected moderation of operating cash flows occurred in the fourth quarter.","That said, we were still able to add approximately $100 million in operating cash flows for the quarter to finish the year well over $1 billion, a record high for the company. We are cautiously optimistic going into the year, as reflected in our original guidance of $775 million to $850 million, but to finish over $1 billion is a tremendous accomplishment.","I want to thank our team members across the enterprise for their efforts in making this a reality. What was anticipated to be a 3 year journey has taken us a little over a year. This is the LKQ culture that I am immensely proud of.","I'll now cover our consolidated and segment results. Similar to last quarter, to save myself some words and the accompanying earnings deck being largely self-explanatory, when I refer to net income and diluted EPS, please note that I will be referring to the amounts from continuing operations attributable to LKQ shareholders. In addition, Nick covered the details of net income and earnings per share, so I will not repeat.","Please turn to Slides 12 and 13 of the presentation for highlights on the consolidated fourth quarter results. The consolidated gross margin percentage increased 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 39.7%, with the improvement primarily coming from North America.","Please note that the reported margin includes $4 million in restructuring-related costs classified in COGS, which represents a 10 basis point negative impact on gross margin. There's a little bit of rounding impact on the components, though adjusted gross margin, which excludes restructuring, is up 120 basis points.","Overhead expenses increased 40 basis points to 29.7, primarily driven by North America and higher transformation costs in Europe. Restructuring and acquisition-related costs were $16 million as a result of ongoing expenses for the initiatives we announced in the second quarter of 2019 and acquisition integration.","Interest expense was favorable by $4 million, a decrease of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of '18, owing to lower interest rates and lower average debt balances. Other income was favorable by $18 million, of which nearly all the variance relates to changes in miscellaneous gains and losses from acquisitions and divestitures, as well as impairment charges. Please note that these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted EPS.","Moving to income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 26.5%, which reflects a reduction in expense for the year to date catch-up caused by the finalization of the annual effective tax rate.","Equity and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which relates mostly to our investment in Mekonomen, reflected income of $1 million versus expense of $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. You will recall that we recorded a $48 million impairment charge on the Mekonomen investment a year ago.","Please now turn to Slide 16 for highlights on segment performance, starting with North America. Gross margin was 46.1% or 260 basis points higher than the prior year. The margin expansion reflects the continued benefits of initiatives in both our aftermarket and salvage operations, as well as efforts in our glass business.","Two additional items in the quarter took these to new highs. One, the positive revenue impact from the GM strike drove a favorable mix impact on gross margin. And two, precious metal prices had reached record levels, providing a boost to revenue per vehicle in our salvage operations.","Falling scrap prices remained a drag on segment gross margin. Sequential changes in scrap prices had a unfavorable impact of $9 million for the quarter compared to a negative impact of $5 million a year ago, creating a $4 million year-over-year negative swing. However, self-service was able to show a quarter-over-quarter margin improvement due to the positive impact from sales of precious metals I referenced earlier.","Operating expenses increased 90 basis points to 32.5% in the fourth quarter. As previously referenced, the North America segment produced 2.5% organic growth in parts and services revenue, which had a positive leverage effect, but there were several offsetting factors that pushed expenses higher than a year ago.","First, incentive compensation contributed a 50 basis point year-over-year increase. Strong operating performance required upward revisions in bonus accruals, pushing expense higher than a year ago.","Second, bad debt expense had an unfavorable impact of 30 basis points. Though to be perfectly clear, this wasn't a deterioration in collections this year as the variance is largely attributable to a high level of recoveries in Q4 of 2018 and saw a negative year-over-year comp.","Third, a gain on the sale of a former Nashville facility a year ago drove a 30 basis point increase in overhead expenses as we did not have a similar gain this past quarter.","Finally, as mentioned in the last few quarters, facility expenses continued to trend higher this year due to expansions and rate increases related to renewals, creating a further 20 basis point impact.","Favorably, North America showed positive leverage of 30 basis points in other personnel costs through lower insurance claim costs, disciplined hiring and the implementation of the cost reduction plan described in the second quarter.","In total, segment EBITDA for North America in the fourth quarter was $180 million, up $27 million or 180 basis points higher from the prior year. Closing out on North America. We know that we can't count on events like the GM strike or record high precious metal prices to be present every quarter. We undeniably saw a margin benefit from both these items, though I don't want to discount the margin achievement as pure good fortune.","As the old saying goes, sometimes, you have to make your own luck. And the North America team deserves credit for being ready to serve the market when the GM strike disrupted supply. Being disciplined operators and seizing available opportunities, the North America team was able to deliver a fantastic quarter.","Moving on to the European segment on Slide 19. Gross margin in Europe was 36.6%, down 10 basis points relative to the comparable period of 2018. Restructuring expenses in the U.K. represented a negative 20 basis point impact for the quarter. Outside of these charges, the segment gross margin was up 10 basis points, with benefits from higher purchasing rebates, mostly offset by lower margins in our Benelux, Eastern European and Italian operations due to lower prices and product mix.","With respect to operating expenses, we experienced a 10 basis point decrease on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter a year ago. For Q4 2019, there was a 30 basis point headwind associated with the ongoing transformation efforts related to the 1 LKQ Europe program.","Personnel expenses were favorable in 2019 by 40 basis points due to restructuring program savings and the benefits of a hiring freeze across the segment. European segment EBITDA totaled $108 million or 90 basis points increase over last year.","As shown on Slide number 21, relative to the fourth quarter of '18, the pound sterling was roughly flat, though the euro weakened by 3% against the dollar, causing a negative effect from translation. Overall, there was a $0.02 headwind on adjusted EPS for the quarter, with roughly equal parts coming from the impact of transaction gains losses and translation.","Segment EBITDA was 7. 6% for the quarter, up 10 basis points compared to the same period last year and includes a 30 basis point headwind owing to transformation expenses I referenced earlier. On a full year basis, segment EBITDA was 7. 8%, within the range we communicated on September 10, the 1 LKQ Europe call. And to be clear, this figure includes 20 basis points of transformation costs for the year.","Turning to the specialty segment on Slide 22. The gross margin percentage declined by 100 basis points in Q4 due to equal impacts from sales mix, including a decrease in revenue from drop shipment sales, and timing of adjustments for customer rebate accruals.","On the other hand, operating expenses improved by 50 basis points with reductions in personnel and freight costs more than offsetting higher vehicle expenses. Segment EBITDA for specialty was $25 million, and as a percentage of revenue was down 10 basis points to 8.4%. With the backdrop of a revenue decline in the fourth quarter, the specialty team continues to take action to control costs, as was evidenced by the year-over-year decrease in operating expense dollars.","Let's move on to liquidity and the balance sheet. As presented on Slide 24, you'll note that our operating cash flow for 2019 was roughly $1.1 billion or 50% higher than 2018. The key working capital accounts, that is trade receivables, inventory and payables, generated a cash inflow of $46 million for the year compared to an outflow of $205 million a year ago.","Our purchasing teams did great work in driving this improvement by applying a disciplined approach to inventory and soft trading conditions and working with our vendor partners to improve payment terms.","CapEx for the year was $266 million, resulting in free cash flow of $798 million, a 73% increase over the prior year. To put this into perspective, our 2019 free cash flow was higher than our 2018 operating cash flow despite a $16 million year-over-year increase in CapEx.","As discussed the last time, we analyzing the efficiency of our cash flows and what [ph] level of earnings we can convert to cash on a sustainable basis. Looking at slide 25, you can see a positive trend in the free cash flow to EBITDA conversion ratio this year based on the programs we put in place in the second half of 2018.","We made significant strides this year to move this ratio closer to where we believe we can operate over the long term. There is further opportunity to improve our conversion, though we do not expect 2019 growth percentages to repeat at the same rate in 2020.","In line with our ongoing judiciousness on capital allocation and capital structure, we concluded that redeeming our $600 million four and three quarters US dollar bonds due in 2023 using cash on hand and lower cost revolver debt was the best use of our liquidity.","The cash generated during the fourth quarter was used to pay approximately $200 million of the bond redemption costs with the remaining funds provided by our credit facility. Additionally, we took the opportunity to exercise a purchase option on our North America headquarters in line with our long term commitment to the national area. We continue to believe that our balance sheet is in good position to support our business objectives.","And finally, moving to Slide number 27, as of the 31st of December, we had $523 million of cash on hand, resulting in net debt of about $3.5 billion. Our net debt. leverage ratio remained level with the third quarter at 2.6 times, but still represents good progress from the 2.9 times rate as of December of 2018. We believe we\u2019ll be able to decrease the stat again in 2020.","Now, I would like to detail our annual guidance for 2020. Please note that the guidance assumes that scrap prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels, and the annual effective tax rate is 27.5%.","Additionally, the guidance assumes no material disruptions associated with the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, the coronavirus outbreak or any escalation in trade wars or tariffs.","We believe North America is poised to carry its strong performance into 2020. We expect that Europe will continue to face some challenging economic conditions, though with the 1 LKQ Europe program and the various restructuring initiatives should take hold and produce further benefits.","Specialty is actively seeking new revenue streams to combat the recent weakness and in the interim will remain focused on right sizing its cost structure for the revenue expectation. We have set organic parts and services revenue growth at 50 basis points to 250 basis points.","Please note that with the leap here we'll have an extra selling day in the first quarter, and we'll hold that for the full year. Also, please note that exiting the low margin FCA battery contract will be a headwind of approximately 30 basis points on global organic and approximately 90 basis points on North America organic growth in 2020.","Diluted EPS on a GAAP basis is a range of $2.20 to $2.32 while adjusted diluted EPS is a range of $2.46 to $2.58 cents. We are projecting solid business growth from a margin improvement efforts, especially in Europe.","As discussed last September, we expect to take a step forward in our drive to double digit margins by producing a segment EBITDA margin for Europe in the range of 8.5% to 9.2%. Starting from a 7.8% base in 2019, the high end of the range will be a stretch, but we remain confident in our ability to finish within the range. Additionally, we should benefit with lower full year interest expense owing to the ongoing debt pay down.","Cash flows from operations reflect a range of 1,150 billion. The midpoint of our guidance is roughly on par with our 2019 actual figure. Keep in mind that our 2019 cash flow growth was approximately 50%. We reached the $1 billion mark in operating cash flows a few years ahead of my expectations, meaning we benefited from significant working capital enhancements that we can't count on to repeat each year at the same level.","We believe we can sustain the new elevated level of operating cash flows with continued focus on trade working capital management and the implementation of the vendor finance program in Europe. And finally, capital spending is set at a range of $250 million to $300 million, a modest increase from the current year level.","And so finally, in summary, the fourth quarter was a solid overall result, with strong performance by North America, offsetting some softness in Europe and Specialty. The fourth quarter reinforced that we need to be disciplined in cost control to manage through low growth periods. We believe that our restructuring programs focused on productivity and the l LKQ Europe project has increased the resiliency of the model and positioned us for future success. Overall, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future.","With that, I'll now turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks.","Nick Zarcone","Thank you, Varun for that financial overview. In closing, 2019 turned out to be a solid year of our company. Our North American operations extended its record of improving operating margins. The European team designed and began the implementation of 1 LKQ Europe, a multi year program that we believe will lead to enhanced levels of productivity and profitability.","The specially team broadened its industry leading efforts in supporting the warranty programs of the RV OEMs and was diligent in honing its cost structure. And all the businesses made significant progress on what counts most, generating cash. Indeed, over $1 billion of cash from operations which we used in equal measure to reduce our leverage and repurchase our shares.","None of this progress would have been possible without the collective efforts of the 51,000 people I am proud to call my colleagues and co-workers. To the men and women of LKQ I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation for all you did to both serve our customers and work in the best interest of our shareholders.","And with that operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Daniel Imbro","Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Nick Zarcone","Good morning, Daniel.","Varun Laroyia","Good morning.","Daniel Imbro","Wondering on the North American gross margins, obviously really strong in the fourth quarter, you noted some of the tailwinds more transitory, record metal prices, GM strike, but things that the freight backdrop do seem to be getting better heading into 2020. So can you help us think about the gross margin trajectory for the company as we head into 2020 as we weigh those put and takes?","Varun Laroyia","Absolutely, Daniel, and good morning to you, but also to everyone else joining us on the call this morning. I know it's fairly early, specifically out on the west coast. Listen with regards to North America as Nick and I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re really happy with the way our North America business has continued to perform and execute against its margin enhancement initiatives.","You'll recall, we started this entire program way back in 2018. And ready for the third quarter of \u201818 onwards, we slowly but surely continued to execute and move the needle up. The fourth quarter of 2019, as I was very clear about was it was significantly better than even our expectations. Clearly the GM strike was not planned. It was not in the budget, for example, but the agility and the nimbleness of our aftermarket team to be able to capitalize on that opportunity gives us a great amount of satisfaction that we have the right operators at the helm.","In addition to that, if you think of it from a salvage perspective, that's another business of us that has really continued to perform very strongly across North America, across the entire year. And then with the record high, precious metal prices coming through, yet again, our salvage business both on the full service but also on self service, they essentially changed certain processes in terms of being able to harvest those precious metals. Again, capitalizing and the agility coming through of being able to capitalize on that opportunity. And that really is key for us.","As we move forward into 2020, we are certainly not banking on those record high prices of precious metals continuing, as you know, the GM strike has ended. And so yes, the overall 14 points of segment EBITDA margin is significantly richer than what we would expect to be the usual cadence associated with that. If you were to try and bracket in terms of what the precious metals and say the GM strike benefited in the quarter, I probably give you roughly about 120 basis points of that - the uptick that we had, you know, we certainly \u2013 a large part of it was due to precious metals, but also due to the GM strikes.","So if you kind of think of it year-over-year, the 180 basis points move up, I'd say about 120 of that 180 was related to precious metals and also GM strike. So think about from that perspective, the business without those two elements probably would have still been up at least 60 bps, you know, on a year-over-year basis. So again, continuing to execute on its margin enhancement initiatives.","So just want to put that piece in terms of the 14 points is not the new normal. So please do not include that into your 2020 model going forward. There were some elements in the market that we were able to capitalize on.","Daniel Imbro","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Stephanie Benjamin","Hi, good morning, I wanted to touch a little bit on some of the weakness that you\u2019ve been seeing really last couple quarters in Italy \u2013 Italy and Germany, also announced some new leadership changes there as well. So maybe if you could kind of discuss what's driving some of the - the slow down, you know, is it macro, a little bit more company specific transitional issues, and, you know, just kind of some of the plans in place where we might expect to see some improvement there and some timing would be helpful? Thank you.","Nick Zarcone","Good morning, Stephanie. This is Nick. The macro economic conditions in Italy, I think is no surprise to anybody. It's very poor. The country has been in recession now for several quarters and that is absolutely flowing through the overall market dynamics. We are seeing and all of our competitors as we talked to people at trade shows and just in the business in general, there's been a downdraft in overall activity.","That said, we did believe that we needed a leadership change. And so we have brought somebody on board from the outside to head up the Italian operation. Actually, it's an individual that worked with Arnd Franz at Molly [ph] and he worked under Arnd for about a dozen years. We're very confident in his abilities and believe that we will be able to, you know, move that business forward as we migrate through 2020.","The German marketplace obviously a big market, again, experienced some overall softness The leadership change there is not necessarily related to the performance of the Stahlgruber business, which overall was good during 2019, but more of a recognition that we needed a single leader within the Stahlgruber business there.","The structure when we acquired the business was there three kind of leaders who shared responsibilities, and we just needed a single head of that business. And so we made that change early this year.","You know, we're not expecting the budget, if you will. This is not assuming that there's going to be a market uptick in either the Italian or the German markets that we do anticipate that we will be able to get better organic growth in both those countries and than we did in 2019.","Stephanie Benjamin","Great. Thank you for the color. I'll leave it at that.","Nick Zarcone","Okay, great.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead.","Craig Kennison","Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions.","Nick Zarcone","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Kennison","Yeah. Good morning. We do appreciate the comprehensive slide deck in 7 a.m. call. So thank you for that. Just want to touch on this Specialty business, you've got so much good news. But there was unexpected weakness in that category. Guess I want to understand should we expect weakness for at least the next three quarters as you kind of anniversary the impact of a relationship that - that has exited?","And then two, what gives you confidence that there's that - that change is not part of a broader trend where you could get disintermediated more broadly? Thank you.","Nick Zarcone","Sure, Craig. Yeah. Built into the plan is an assumption that the Specialty business is going to be relatively flat during 2020. Maybe even down just a touch based on as you indicated, the need to anniversary some of these changes. We highlighted kind of two key customers, one of which is the result of an acquisition, where one of our customers was the acquired entity and the acquirer or always went through act. And so when they - when they bought our customer, they just put their volume through their direct distribution system. We don't think - we think that's a one-off.","The other entity has a very unique market position with an incredible brand name. And they had the ability to take some, not all their value, but some of their volume back internally. And again, we think it's unique related to their brand identity as opposed to anything else. So we're not - we don't see it as an ongoing - as a ongoing trend.","Craig Kennison","Thank you.","Nick Zarcone","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Hoffman","Thank you very much. Nick, Varun and Joe. On the cash flow, if I follow the math of what's in the guidance, make an assumption about D&A. So the midpoint of net income 695 gets a 324 D&A approximately, I'm at 10, 15 [ph] on cash flow from ops. So that says you're going to get another positive incremental, not as great as 2019 I get it. But working capital still helping, are we looking at that correctly?","Varun Laroyia","Yeah, I think. Michael, good morning. Its Varun out here. Listen, you kind of followed us, you know, from a cash perspective for the past few years and stuff. And all I can say is thank you yet again to a broader colleagues across all of LKQ for just a tremendous result coming on from a cash perspective.","To kind of give you a little bit more and kind of get to your specific answer in any case, you know, when we put in place working capital metrics, and really what we call internally for our field folks is trade working capital, this is inventory, plus the receivables offset by payables, the underlying quality and I think you can kind of work the math out through the public tables that we've put out there in any cases.","The company has made progress on all three fronts. It wasn't just a case of pushing up tables. It wasn't just a case of throttling back or being more judicious on the inventory. We picked up days inventory on hand in terms of lower on these inventory on hand. We push DPO [ph] up a little bit. And we've also gotten some DSO down, albeit very little, because we haven't changed any terms on our customers. All we really focused on is collecting past due receivables, right.","But the sheer scale at which our business has been able to deliver on this is, as I said, I'm just tremendously pleased with that. And so if you think of it from a EBITDA conversion level to OCF, yeah, I mean, that's a high percentage versus where we've historically been. In 2018 we moved up. In 2019 we moved up significantly.","And to kind of give you a rough math, just on trade working capital, it was down $250 million across inventory, receivables and tables, despite the fact that reported revenues were up $630 million.","If you kind of go back to our Investor Day in May of 2018, you can recall, I kind of shown a trend to everybody in terms of how trade working capital as a percentage of revenue had been steadily increasing for the previous five years, up to kind of north of $0.24 in the revenue dollar.","That is the one that we focused on. And by focusing on those very specific items, not confusing everyone in terms of what we were trying to do, we've made a tremendous amount of progress.","And so, as you think about it, yes, we do expect to grow some, but as I said, it's at this point of time we are now in a sustainability mode, okay. How do we continue to hit the conversion levels that we were able to achieve in 2019? I do not expect this level of trade working capital decline in 2020.","But again, there were certain elements that we had to get reset, which we've been able to do and that's a case of continuing to deliver on the sustainability of EBITDA conversion. So that's really where we are. But I think your math roughly holds.","Michael Hoffman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Bret Jordan","Good morning, guys.","Nick Zarcone","Good morning.","Bret Jordan","On the working capital conversation Varun, can you give us an update as to where we are on payables? I guess specifically on the European side of the business? I think your accounts payable were a little bit higher than they were in the prior year. But you know, clearly versus the O'Reilly's of the world much lower. So, I guess what's the thought there?","Varun Laroyia","Yeah. So I'll give you - I'll give you two key points out that Bret. Number one, as I said in my previous response, we made progress both - actually across all three elements of trade working capitals, so day's inventory on hand has come down. DPO has moved up and then DSO is marginally down by about a day. But DPO is up by about four days for the entire enterprise.","Now think of it from that perspective and as we think of the cash conversion cycle, we picked up the better part of seven to eight days in terms of where we were even say a year ago, right. So great progress on that front, and from two years ago that much more.","Specifically to your question about how is the European payables program coming along. Listen it is coming along right at expectations. There were two key elements that I talked about. The end outcome really is to ensure that we have better payment terms across our European business. No different to say some of the big box folks enjoy out here in the North America business.","Clearly they've been at it for the better part of a decade and a half, almost kind of two decades. We were just kind of getting started a year ago and really where we've come through is, we focus on the largest markets with regards to the vendor financing program and really there's two kind of alternatives for our suppliers. The end result being we need better payment terms.","And a number of our suppliers have either signed up to the vendor financing program, which is great news. And there are others who say listen, if you're kind of go through that entire process of getting invoices, going through an EDI link, connecting to financial situation, it's too complicated, we will give you the terms that you're looking for.","The end result is we are seeing you know, with contracts that are essentially kicking in for 2020, we are seeing that payment terms being extended in line with what our expectations are and then to kind of close the loop for you, if you kind of go back to the September 10th 1 LKQ Europe call that we had, we were very specific in terms of what level of cash we anticipated generating, which is about $200 million, by the end of 2021 we are right on track.","We\u2019re very confident that 2020 will play out exactly the way we planned. The team has made tremendous progress out there and yeah, happy with how things are progressing.","Bret Jordan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Chris Bottiglieri","Nice, she got it. Quick question on Europe margin targets, you guys gave the analyst day back in September, it kind of gave some annual targets for the next couple of years. Obviously, macro remains really challenging. You've added some leadership changes, just kind of curious what your latest thinking is, those are still the right targets and kind of like what you've learned as you delve deeper to those plans? Thank you.","Nick Zarcone","Good morning, Chris. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, the 1 LKQ Europe program is on track and on plan. The expectation is that - kind the guidance, if you will, that we provided on September 10, related to the margin accretion over the next couple years, that those ranges are still valid.","As Varun indicated in his comments, 2020 getting to the top, top end of the range is going to be a bit of a stretch. But within the range, we are comfortable. And so really, there's been no change. I mean, it's, it's only been, you know, the better part of a little bit more than a quarter that we're into the program. We're affecting the changes that we believe were necessary to get us to the promised land, if you will.","We are making progress. You know, there are going to be some things that are not going to go according to plan, and they're going to be some other things that actually do better than, than we expect. And so we're taking it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but by enlarge we are comfortable with the guidance provided back in September.","Chris Bottiglieri","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Stember with C.L. King. Please go ahead.","Scott Stember","Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions.","Nick Zarcone","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Stember","Just going back to Specialty, you outlined the issues that happened in the quarter. We expect that to continue, I guess, at least for the next couple of quarters. But you then said that you would expect organic sales to be flat. So I'm assuming you're expecting some of these like the additional RV OEM warranty program that some of the positive developments at SEMA. So maybe just talk about how that will progress to actually offset which seems to be a pretty sizable losses in sales that you had this past year. Thanks.","Nick Zarcone","Yeah. So you know, during 2019 the Speciality group started supplying the OE manufacturers actually they're dealing that work with warranty parts, because we can do it for efficiently than the OEs can do themselves. Again, that was a slow ramp. But now we're at the point where we have every major OE manufacturer in the barn if you will, where we are the leading and the supplier of their, of their warranty parts. And so we will get a positive benefit of that through 2020, as each of those programs ramp up and anniversary.","We've got some other key elements, we\u2019ve talked about Warn, which is our Winch, business, with several new programs that we think are going to provide positive benefits.","And then you know, the historical legacy of the Specialty group, which is the kind of the automotive accessories, you know, that businesses is doing okay. And so we do believe that there's going to be some gives and some takes, which is taken as a whole will largely offset each other.","Scott Stember","Got it. Thank you.","Nick Zarcone","No problem.","Varun Laroyia","Thank you.","Operator","There no further question at this time, I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.","Nick Zarcone","Well as always we greatly appreciate your time and attention. We know that this reporting season is incredibly busy for all of you and the time you spent with us is greatly appreciated. We are looking forward to a very good and productive 2020. We will come back together in about 60 days to report our first quarter results. And again, I just want to reiterate to all the men and women of LKQ, we really appreciate everything they have done and will continue to do to make our company perform well and serve our customers and our shareholders. So with that, we bring the call to a close. And thank you for your time and attention today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Quinn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

A replay of the audiocast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call.","Before we begin our discussion, I would like to remind everyone that the statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. In Q3, revenue reached a new quarterly high of $1.72 billion, an increase of 32.6% as compared to Q3 2013. Net income for the third quarter of 2014 was $91.5 million, an increase of 24.6% as compared to $73.4 million for the same period in 2013. Diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2014, increased 25% from $0.24 for the third quarter of 2013. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2014 would've been $0.31 compared to $0.25 for the third quarter of 2013 after adjusting for any net losses resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses and changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. During the quarter, we achieved organic revenue growth and acquisition revenue growth for parts and services of 8.9% and 24.6%, respectively. I am particularly pleased with the North American organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.7%.","Now more detail on our North American operations. During the third quarter, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 2.4% increase from Q3 2013. With the Manheim Index trending down over the last 5 months, I want to take a moment to touch on one aspect of our car buying that could impact us in the coming quarters. One way to grow recycled parts business is to simply buy more cars. If we buy 5% more vehicles and they are the right vehicles for which there is demand, then our revenue in that segment should increase proportionately. It is also possible to grow revenue buying a better-quality car, one that will part out for additional revenue. So while the number of vehicles we bought this quarter was up only modestly, we remain confident in our ability to grow the top line because of the better-quality car we are purchasing. While used car prices are falling, we have increased the average value of inventory acquired. We believe that this decision will drive incremental revenue and gross margin dollars in the coming quarters. Because of the life of the selling cycle, this will likely take 2 quarters to fully manifest itself in our results.","During the quarter, our aftermarket parts business continued to deliver solid organic growth. Between 2009 and 2013, the average number of parts being replaced on a repair claim has increased 10% with 75% of the increase being captured by aftermarket parts. Insurers' expanded use of aftermarket parts is being driven by the value proposition of aftermarket parts and the increased supply availability as evidenced by a 32% year-over-year increase in the number of available certified parts. In our self-service retail business, during the third quarter, we acquired approximately 134,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars as compared to 128,000 in Q3 of 2013 or roughly a 4.5% increase.","Now turning to our European operations. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to increase market share. In Q3, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 17.9%. This figure includes, for the first time, the paint businesses acquired in August last year. Excluding our paint locations, ECP's organic revenue growth during the quarter was 10.4% for branches open more than 12 months. I am particularly pleased with the ongoing double-digit organic growth despite facing unseasonably warm September, a soft overall economic environment in the U.K. during the quarter and coming up a year that benefited from aggressive branch openings in 2012.","On August 7, 2014, ECP assumed the leases of 27 former Unipart Automotive branches. Unipart was a large competitor, which went into receivership during the quarter. We don't intend to retain all of these locations. Our plan is to keep some of the smaller satellite locations to existing branches. Some will become the main branch in that market, replacing our existing site. And some will be operated temporarily while we find a more suitable location in certain markets. When that rationalization is completed, we anticipate that we will net out 18 new ECP branches. Initially, we will incur some upfront costs with these transactions that will cause a drag on earnings. However, we believe this deal positions us well to continue our market share gains in the U.K. and advance our sales to the Unipart Car Care Centres and national accounts. In addition, we've been able to hire many experienced people from across former Unipart. Further highlighting this point, since Unipart went into receivership, our existing ECP branches have seen averages sales per day to Unipart Car Care Centres and national accounts increase 57% and 23%, respectively. During the quarter, ECP opened up a total of 15 branches, 3 new ECP branches and 12 converted Unipart Automotive branches, bringing our current network to 179 branch locations. Our target is to have 190 branches by year-end, including the balance of the Unipart locations.","Now an update on ECP's collision program. During the quarter, we continued to witness strong double-digit year-over-year growth of nearly 30% with our collision parts sales. And for the first time, we are witnessing our impact to the U.K. APU rate. Based on reports from multiple industry participants, U.K. APU today stands at 9%, which is a 200 basis point improvement since we launched ECP's collision program in March of 2012. And of that 200 basis points improvement, we believe the vast majority is a direct result of our efforts in educating carriers and body shops of our value proposition to not only drive down cost but to assure them of the quality of the aftermarket collision products and ECP's ability to get them to the shop on time. In conjunction with the growth of ECP's collision parts program, I am also pleased with the growth we are achieving with ECP's paint sales from the distributors we acquired in August 2013. The growth we are witnessing with our paint sales further highlights the leverage and synergies our one-stop shop collision model can achieve in new geographic segments.","Now let's turn to our Sator business. On August 27, 2014, the company completed its acquisition of an automotive aftermarket products parts distributor with 11 branches in the Netherlands. This acquisition supports our ongoing plan to convert Sator distribution network from a 3-step to a 2-step model. We anticipate that once we rationalize these 11 branch locations with Sator's existing network, we will net 8 new branches, bringing Sator's branch count to 60. As mentioned on previous calls, our target is 75 to 80 branches for building up the Netherlands market. Though we saw a decline in EBITDA margin in Europe this quarter, driven in part by integration of Netherlands distributors into Sator, we believe the strategic initiatives have positioned us well for executing our growth strategy. Despite the loss of some export sales, Sator posted 2.1% organic growth in the quarter.","Now an update on our specialty segment. Keystone Specialty continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year growth of 13.4% in the quarter and year-to-date growth of 11% against its preacquisition results. To further expand Keystone Specialty's presence in the RV market with its existing NTP Distribution business, on October 3, the company announced that it acquired Stag-Parkway. Stag-Parkway is a leading aftermarket distributor of recreational vehicle parts and accessories in North America that has been serving a diverse base of over 6,000 customers from 600 suppliers for the past 50 years. Stag-Parkway offers a broad selection of parts and accessories with next-day shipments that covers 95% of North America. Stag currently operates 12 warehouses in the United States. We believe there are ample opportunities for synergies and for leveraging our existing North American distribution network with the combination of Stag and Keystone Specialty's existing RV business.","In addition to the acquisitions in Europe and specialty segments, during the third quarter 2014, the company made 2 additional North American acquisitions, including a salvage yard in Nova Scotia, Canada and a heavy-duty truck salvage yard in Illinois. As you can see, we've been very busy with acquisitions and proud to report that we have completed 20 acquisitions for the first 9 months of 2014, including 12 in North America alone, with the additional 8 in Europe. Acquisition candidates continue to exist across all of our operating segments, and we are well positioned to execute operationally and financially as opportunities present themselves.","At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results for the quarter.","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Rob. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Revenue for Q3 2014 was $1.7 billion, an increase of $423 million or 33% over the $1.3 billion we achieved in Q3 2013. Earnings growth was a healthy 25% increase.","I'll point out some things about earnings to help explain the difference relative to revenue growth. As a frame of reference, the way we looked at the quarter was as follows. Last year, in Q3, we reported $0.24 of diluted earnings per share when there was $0.01 unfavorable impact from restructuring, acquisition and contingent payment adjustments. There was also $0.01 favorable adjustment relating to discrete tax items. This year, our reported diluted earnings per share was $0.30. We had $0.01 of unfavorable impact from restructuring, acquisition and contingent payment adjustments. Not in our guidance but in our actual results was a further $0.005 of unfavorable impact associated with the new branch startups in the U.K. as a result of a competitor, Unipart, going into insolvency administration. In our guidance but not necessarily in some analyst models was the unfavorable impact of not being able to recognize profit on sales to recently acquired companies in the Netherlands. That was a further $0.01 impact of our earnings. I realize there's a lot going on here, so I'll repeat some of this analysis in the rest of my remarks.","The revenue growth breaks down as follows: For Q3, our total organic revenue growth was 8.5% and we delivered additional growth of 22.7% from acquisitions with foreign exchange adding a further 1.3%. Organic growth of parts and services was 8.9%. Within that, we saw our North American operations grow organically 6.7% while the European segment grew 13.4%. North American growth was the highest we've reported in the last 5 quarters. We believe that this growth reflects the basic fundamentals of the company's markets and our value proposition.","Last quarter, in our prepared remarks and in our recent investor presentations, we stated that we believe that we should start to see the benefit of higher miles driven, the benefit of higher new car sales starting to come into our sweet spot for alternative parts demand. The fundamental value proposition of alternative parts for the consumer and the insurance companies continues to drive demand as measured in parts consumption. It's our belief that these dynamics will continue to afford our industry and LKQ, in particular, opportunities for continued organic growth in North America.","As we anticipated in the last quarterly call, the European segment showed lower growth as we have included the U.K. paint operations acquired in August last year in organic growth for the first time, along with Sator for a full quarter for the first time. Even including the paint businesses, ECP continues to show strong organic growth of 18%. We saw Sator return to positive organic revenue growth with a 2.1% improvement, helped by our expansion in France. With the acquisition of some of our major customers and converting the distribution to a 2-step model, we anticipated some loss of revenue in the base business. But through the first 6 months, those losses have been well controlled and the base business is growing even in a difficult economic environment.","Acquisitions completed in the last 12 months through September 30 contributed $295 million to Q3 2014 revenue on a reported basis, including $4 million from acquisitions completed in Q3 2014. The annualized revenue from acquisitions completed in Q3 2014 was approximately $37 million or $9 million per quarter. Rob mentioned we acquired Stag-Parkway earlier in October. Obviously, none of that revenue is in the quarterly numbers. But for modeling purposes, we are estimating that Stag will have an annual revenue of approximately $180 million.","Total change in other revenue, which is where we recorded scrap commodity sales, was positive 15%. Acquisitions contributed 9% positive growth and we had 6% organic growth, primarily volume increases, as fuel pricing was about 3% lower year-over-year. The average price we received for scraps deal was $215 per ton this year versus $221 per ton in Q3 2013. Other revenue was 10.3% of total revenue as compared to 11.9% for the same period last year, reflecting the declining relative importance of this revenue to our overall results. In Q3 2014, revenue for our self-serve business was $115 million or 6.7% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 31% of this revenue was parts sales included in North American parts and services revenue and 69% scrap and core sales included in other revenue.","Our reported gross margin for Q3 2014 was $664 million or 38.6% of revenue, a decline of approximately 130 basis points from our gross margin percentage of 39.3% in Q3 2013. There was 130 basis point decline attributable to the specialty acquisition. Mix and some smaller acquisitions are offsetting a 60 basis point improvement in the base North American business. We are encouraged to see these continued improvements in the North American margins. As I explained in last quarter's call, we're not able to recognize the intercompany profit on sales by Sator to the newly acquired distributors until we complete 1 turn of inventory and those products are sold to the final customers. That process is behind us now. But in Q3 2014, it impacted our gross margins by approximately $4.6 million. Had we not had that impact, our gross margin percentage would have been 30 basis points higher and our EPS about $0.01 higher.","Moving to operating expenses. Some of the comparisons are being affected by our specialty acquisition. In the specialty line of business, gross margins tend to be lower, but they incur relatively lower facility and SG&A costs. Specialty will affect the comparisons for the remainder of the year. Facility and warehouse costs were 7.7% of revenue in Q3 2014, a 60 basis point improvement over the 8.3% in Q3 last year. This improvement is primarily due to specialty, which tends to run lower facility costs than the rest of our operations. Distribution cost increased slightly from 8.4% of revenue in Q3 2013 to 8.6% this quarter. This change was mainly attributable to higher cost in the U.K., which was associated with the new branch openings and some startup costs, which we are incurring on the former Unipart locations.","Selling and G&A expenses decreased from 11.8% of revenue in Q3 last year to 11.2% in Q3 this year, an improvement of 60 basis points. Keystone Specialty accounts for 30 basis points of the improvement, but 20 basis points of that was offset by the Netherlands acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we saw North American leverage generate a 50 basis point improvement in this market. So in summary, the combination of facility and warehouse, distribution and SG&A cost was 27.5% of revenue in Q3 2014 as compared to 28.6% in Q3 2013. About half of that improvement is a net impact of acquisitions, offset by incremental cost of ECP and the other half was leverage from the North American operations.","During Q3 2014, we recorded $3.6 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, up from $2.2 million in Q3 last year. The 2014 cost is primarily related to the operations in the Netherlands. Depreciation and amortization was 1.8% of revenue during Q3 this year as compared to 1.6% of revenue in Q3 2013. This increase was due to higher amortization related to intangibles, primarily at the specialty acquisition. Other expenses net increased to $16.4 million in the 3 months ended September 2014, compared to $14.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of $2 million. The main components of the change included net interest expense, which is $1.2 million higher, with $2.4 million attributable to higher debt levels, partially offset by a $1.2 million reduction in lower interest rates. Adjustments to continued consideration were negligible this quarter as compared to an expense of $700,000 in Q3 last year. Other income is also negligible this year, whereas in Q3 2013, it was a positive $1.6 million. This change is also entirely due to currency changes, which generated income of $500,000 last year over a loss of $900,000 this year.","Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 3.5%. Our year-to-date effective income tax rate was 34% as compared to 34.6% the prior year. In Q3 2014, our effective rate was 34% versus 32.6% Q3 last year. As we previously disclosed, in Q3 last year, we had some favorable discrete items which lowered the rate, impacting earnings per share favorably by approximately $0.01 at that time. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.30 in Q3 2014 compared to $0.24 in Q3 2013, an improvement of 25%. Adjusting for the restructuring, acquisition-related expenses and contingent consideration adjustments, EPS would have been about $0.01 higher both this year and the last. So on an adjusted basis, Q3 would have been $0.31 as compared to $0.25 last year. I've also pointed the $0.01 EPS impact to gross margin caused by the Netherlands acquisitions and the $0.01 impact for discrete items in last year's taxpayers. We believe the U.K. branch openings will have further unanticipated $0.005 loss this year. We always have some types of these costs in the company. But in this case, they were not contemplated in our July guidance.","Switching to our year-to-date cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $323 million through 9 months in 2014 compared to $341 million in 2013. Net income and depreciation were favorable to cash flow by $67 million and $29 million, respectively. Growth in accounts receivable was an incremental 35 -- $34 million use of cash as we continue to grow revenue organically. Similarly, inventory was an incremental use of cash of $37 million as we invest in inventory for the expanded business. The timing of cash taxes resulted in a higher outflow of funds in 2014 compared to 2013 of $20 million and other operating assets was a net use of $21 million, primarily as a result of interest payments on our senior notes and bonus payments in 2014.","Capital spending was $100 million in the first 9 months of 2014, and we spent $651 million in cash on acquisitions, the largest being specialty, which accounted for $427 million of the total. During the quarter, we amended our asset securitization program, increasing the facility size from $80 million to $97 million and extending the maturity to October 2017. We ended Q3 2014 with $1.9 billion of debt and cash and cash equivalents were $245 million. Availability in our credit facility was approximately $1.1 billion and with the cash, total liquidity was approximately $1.4 billion. So we have the capacity to pursue additional acquisitions if suitable opportunities arise.","Now turning to guidance. The new guidance is calling for net income between $405 million and $417 million. That equates to revised earnings per share guidance of $1.32 to $1.36. We left the remainder of our guidance unchanged from February. Our guidance in 2014 for organic revenue growth from parts and services is 8% to 10% and our guidance for capital expenditures is $110 million to $140 million with cash from operations of approximately $375 million.","I'll point out where we see some differences from the last quarter and how we think those impacted Q3 or may impact Q4. Relative to the guidance we provided in Q2, the major changes we've seen relate to the U.K. branch expansion, foreign exchange rates and scrap. The new U.K. branch openings since our last call were not anticipated in our prior guidance. We acquired these locations on very favorable terms. And while it should be a long-run positive for us, they are requiring some initial further investment. We are working very quickly to get these opened and expect that the portfolio will be largely rationalized by the end of the year. We believe that the losses from this program likely will cost us about $0.005 in earnings per share in Q3 and will be almost $0.01 loss in Q4. As I'm sure listeners are aware, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many currencies, including the Canadian dollar, the euro and the pound. We believe this negatively impacted us in Q3 partly because the earnings convert to lower U.S. dollars but also with short-term losses we recorded in other income, which I mentioned a moment ago. We believe that given where rates are today, we could see $0.015 to $0.01 impact to earnings per share relative to the Q2 guidance. Scrap was down slightly in Q3 but not really enough to call out as an issue. However, we have seen fairly steep drops in October, and we're hearing there's potential further drops in November. We are adjusting our car buying to reflect this, but that takes time and can cause some volume decreases, as we tend to leave the market on the downside. It is possible that we could see the combined volume price from scrap being as much as $0.01 impact to EPS in Q4. As we have discussed before, we see these fluctuations as short-term gains and losses, which take a quarter or 2 to correct but fundamentally don't change the business.","And one final reminder, the U.K. paint businesses were included in our organic growth only half the quarter and they'll be in the figure for the full quarter in Q4. So we may get a slight tick-down in the European organic growth as a result of that. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Rob before we open it up to questions.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, John. To summarize, we are pleased with our results in the third quarter and for the first 9 months of the year and we are optimistic of what lies ahead for our company. Looking ahead, in North America the recent upswing in miles driven, lower gas prices and increased new car sales should provide nice tailwind to our collision business. In addition, a younger car part that is fully insured and more frequent driving should equate to a higher accident frequency, resulting in more repairs.","For insurance companies, the competition for premium dollars is fierce with the personal lines insurance industry today spending more than 3x what they spent on marketing and advertising in 2002. We view this as a positive for LKQ because the value proposition of alternative collision parts continues to be a real solution for insurance carriers to drive down their costs. Another potential positive is that we continue to believe that as more new cars are sold; used car prices will continue to fall. The Manheim Index is down over 1% year-over-year through September, which is good for the cost of the salvage vehicles we procure for our North American recycling business. And as you can see by the acquisitions completed thus far in 2014, North America continues to be a priority in key segments for LKQ, and we have runway to grow our network within all lines of our businesses.","In the U.K., in just 2 years, we have built aftermarket-only collision parts business from scratch, which is now approaching $70 million of revenue. Our efforts in the U.K. have played the key role in driving APU growth by 28%. We continue to believe there are ample opportunities to grow this business line in the U.K. and soon the launch on the continent. Again this growth has been accomplished with aftermarket collision parts only, leaving many more untapped opportunities for LKQ in Europe, including salvage, reman and heavy truck, which we continue to explore regularly.","In Europe, there are approximately 280 million vehicles on the road, roughly 14% larger than the United States, yet there is no pan-European distributor scale serving the professional mechanical and collision repair. In just over 2 years, LKQ is a leading player in Europe servicing these customers. This dynamic highlights the fragmented nature of this operating segment and a market ripe for consolidation. Lastly, our acquisition strategy has always been to acquire the best assets we can with the best management teams and use those strengths to lever the business to higher growth rates. Clearly, Keystone Specialty fits that criteria and we believe there is opportunity to grow this segment in the niches it serves.","In closing, our team of over 29,000 employees work tirelessly to create and evolve what we will believe is a unique company. Our extensive networks, the breadth of our inventory and our industry-leading fulfillment position us well to deliver consistent growth organically and from acquisitions across all of our operating segments. This combination should translate into continued long-term value for our stockholders.","And with that, Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of key points that you highlighted, organic growth, U.K. APUs, up 200 basis points, and then Sator profit. I want to ask one quick clarification and a follow-up. Rob, on one of the comments you made with respect to the focus on late-model vehicle purchases, it seems to tie with what you're talking about in terms of the sweet spot in terms of the growth of kind of 3-, 4-, 5-year-old units in operation. But at the same time, it doesn't seem like you're looking for any degradation in the pricing environment. So perhaps is that an element of sort of conservatism in your outlook that could incrementally drive a better result looking into the fourth quarter and beyond?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. Jamie, obviously, with car parts shifting to a newer car part, this was a strategy of ours that we have led very quickly. We want to start buying a newer car. That's going to do a couple of things for us. As I mentioned on previous calls, with our shifts switching from an average request of a 7-mod-year car to a 9-mod-year-old car, we were selling an older car part at a lower price. We do believe that we can, in essence, acquire the same number of cars and increase our top line to meet our expectations because we'll be selling at a higher price. With Manheim coming down as well, we do expect a lower cost of this type of vehicles across the board. So we can buy a better car that will part for more at a reasonable price because of Manheim coming down. So it was a conscious shift on our part and we think we can take advantage of that going into 2015 and beyond.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","It just sounds like it's building, I guess, is my point as well.","Robert L. Wagman","Absolutely, yes. You're going to see that sweet spot start to get a lot stronger here as those 16 and 17 million car parts move its way towards 2 and 3 years old, which is already happening. So we believe that we're going to start seeing some tailwind from that for sure.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, just on the gross margin side, John, thanks for the details as well, trying to understand a little bit on the Sator comment you made. But overall, 130 basis point degradation year-over-year with a 60 basis point lift in core, which has been, I think, consistent with the last 2 or 3 quarters of 60, 70 basis point lift in core. So as we look into the fourth quarter and beyond, we're going to cycle through some of the bigger-picture acquisition headwinds. How should we think about the compares if you look into 2015? It seems like it will be a positive environment for further gross margin expansion. But what are the headwinds that we're missing that we should be considering for next year as well?","John S. Quinn","Yes. Thanks, Jamie. So there's about 130 basis point drop in Q3 year-over-year. I think we called out about 130 basis of that was specifically tied to the Keystone Specialty acquisition. We think there's about 60 basis points that's just tied to some of the smaller deals, including some of those -- the acquisitions that we did in the Netherlands, where we weren't able to recognize the intercompany profit that you would normally see coming through in the inventory until we actually sell that product through an inventory turn. That's behind us now. It was about a $4.6 million impact at relatively low tax rate in the Netherlands of 25%. So that was probably about another 30 basis points. Obviously, that's not a year-over-year impact, but it is in the numbers, and we just want to try to explain that because I'm not sure everybody appreciated that, even when we tried to call it out on the last quarterly call. And then you did see at the North American base business, we have about 60 basis point improvement. So those 2 kind of netted off against each other. In terms of what's going -- where we see coming down the pipeline, obviously we won't have a repeat of that intercompany issue in Q4, that's behind us. We do think though that scrap is going to fall. We know scrap is falling, and we don't know how far. But I did call out that it could be about $0.01 impact. So in North America, $5 million is roughly $0.01. So that will probably hurt us in Q4 a little bit. But that, I guess, I said, will be offset by the impact of Sator picking up. And then you just have the normal seasonality in terms of the base business. Generally speaking, the collision business is a little bit stronger. And so we do normally see a seasonal impact. It is a positive on that side. Sometimes the margins can be a little bit weaker on the mechanical side in Europe because you have December, where it's lower in Keystone and Stag acquisition are obviously going to be. That's a seasonal low for them as well. Going into next year, obviously we're not giving guidance yet for that. But a lot of these things that I just talked about are sort of more -- I won't call them one-time events, but they're unusual events that we don't expect to repeat. Obviously, the scrap, we address our procurement. So that will bleed through in the quarter, so -- and then we'll get through the Sator thing, continue the integration with respect to some of the integrations over there. It's probably a little bit of a drag with respect to the opening of the new branches in the ECP. So we may see a little bit improvement there, as Rob mentioned, with respect to the car cost as well. So that's maybe a little bit more than you asked for, but...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A question as it relates to the Keystone Specialty business. I mean, could you sort of just refresh us on what its growth was on a comparable basis, and then how you're seeing that underlying industry growth? I mean, that number, it seems like it's expanding better than the rate of performance parts. And maybe some feeling for market share gains or what might be driving the expansion there.","Robert L. Wagman","Bret, year-over-year on the core was 13.4% and year-to-date was 10.3%. So I think what's driving that is the SAAR rate. There's no doubt about it. People are most likely going to accessorize their vehicle at the time of purchase. And many of our better customers or dealerships have really rolled this right into the bank note. So we are very bullish on that quite frankly with the SAAR rate being strong. We think their growth rate is going to continue for as long as the SAAR rate remains strong.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then on Stag, could you give us any more color as far as what their productivity maybe EBITDA rates were on that $180 million in revenues?","Robert L. Wagman","Well, let me talk full synergy, where we think we're going to be on that, Bret. Let's talk about the deal as a whole. We paid approximately $110 million for the business with revenue of circa $180 million, as John mentioned. Post synergies -- and we think there's a lot, they have a couple of years to get that. There's a lot of warehouse consolidation that needs to be done. But post synergy, we expect we'll be in the multiple range of our normal multiple range that we pay for business, in the 4 to 6. And I believe it will be closer to the lower end of the range than the higher end of the range when we're all said and done.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Any news out of State Farm? Could you give us an update on where they are with the chrome bumper business, if there's any signs of expanding that?","Robert L. Wagman","Absolutely. This quarter, again really good growth on chrome bumpers. We were up 22.4%. And again really hard to tie how much of that is to State Farm, but we know the market wasn't growing at 22.4% for sure. So we think they have a lot to do with that. Nothing new coming on out of Bloomington, unfortunately. But we remind them every quarter of the results and they show their appreciation for that. There is one uptick to the insurance side of the business. GEICO insurance just became the second-largest insurance company in the United States. It overtook Allstate. They just had phenomenal growth. They're very active users of our products. So even if some of the bigger companies, the State Farms, continue to not use our products, gains by aggressive companies like GEICO continue to bode well for us and really provide a great future.","Bret David Jordan - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question, on the 60 basis points gross margin expansion in North America core, could you give us a color on what the pricing environment looks like as far as competition? Is product sourcing generating the margin? Or is it a less competitive pricing environment that's helping?","John S. Quinn","It was spread across all the lines of business, I think. We saw a little bit improvement in the self-service business. We saw the aftermarket business, we are benefiting a little bit from, we believe, better procurement on that side of the business. It's difficult to say exactly how the Manheim Index is impacting us in terms of the salvage business because as it's coming down, as Rob mentioned, we are buying a slightly better car. So we're investing in more expensive cars than we were a year ago. But we believe that's going to ultimately translate into higher organic growth because they'll have higher -- those cars will part out for more dollars.","Robert L. Wagman","And let me just add one thing, Bret, that Q3 historically has not been one of our better gross margin quarters. So to have that expansion in this quarter, we're very pleased with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe start with the guidance, especially on Q4. Your full year organic growth guidance is unchanged, but you're up 9.1% for the first 9 months. So if I do the math, you've got a pretty wide range for Q4. Any insight into why you've decided to keep it so wide? And maybe what are trends looking like so far this quarter?","John S. Quinn","We just didn't really see any reason to change it, quite frankly. I think it's more than a meaningful change to try to tweak it down or up meaningfully in the quarter to be perfectly frank. In terms of the quarter-to-date, do you have any comments?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. The quarter so far, October, obviously we're 3 weeks in -- almost 4 weeks in, going to plan. We always seem to get a little bit of uptick when we switch to daylight savings time, which happens next week, so pretty much to plan.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then with respect to Europe and your progress with insurance companies there, I'm curious if there's some kind of internal metric you use to determine the pace of adoption? Obviously, you've talked about the whole industry being up pretty significantly. But I'm wondering if you can track your progress with specific insurance companies and if some are outperforming others in terms of their adoption curve.","Robert L. Wagman","We can certainly, Craig, where they have their own collision repair shops. And we are seeing more and more adoption through that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the 200 basis point improvement, we believe, we have a major part in that increase. So we do watch the insurance companies, again with their own body shop, so we could track that. Outside, when they're using independents and the direct repair facilities, it's much more difficult because we often don't know who the carrier is at that time. Our focus now is to really hone in on those 17 carriers that we have those relationships with that have an 80% market share and just keep driving the business. No negative news out of any of those carriers whatsoever, not a pullback. So we're optimistic that we can continue to drive this. And at some point, we're going to bring this to the continent. And really what we're waiting for there is really skip the integration of the 3 -- the companies that we bought, the end line distributors at Sator. Once that's complete and we think we'll do that in 2015, we'll be able to watch the collision parts program on the continent.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And finally, I imagine as your insurance company partners are successful with the adoption of these aftermarket parts, they'll start considering recycled parts. At what point do you think it will make sense for you to introduce those types of parts as well?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. It's going to be sooner than later. We have people looking at opportunities over there. We made initially a promise to them that if they adopted the aftermarket parts, we would look to expand our business. They clearly have done that. So I think you'll see us enter the salvage parts business in 2015 somewhere in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Rob, would you take a step further and just go on the European side and maybe walk through sort of that -- the differences maybe in the flows? Obviously, it's a favorable development to get those stores from Unipart. But just give us a little difference in the flows of the upfront cost versus -- on this deal versus if you were just greenfield.","John S. Quinn","John, it's John Quinn speaking. I'll just start and Rob can supplement it maybe. The Unipart branches, at the time they went into administration, they had been 165 location and were doing, we think, around GBP 165 million. So their productivity at those individual branches is obviously much smaller than what an equivalent ECP branch would do. They were shut down for a number of weeks. And so obviously some of the customers have gone away. We acquired the leases through the administration process, went back and tried to hire as many of the staff that we thought we could that were associated with those branches. But we basically got no inventory. We had to take the signage down. We had to rerack them, and then get our inventory in there and get them into our system. So it's not too dissimilar to a greenfield. I guess, the point we were trying to make was that those things were not in our original guidance. We didn't anticipate the normal startup losses, which is why we didn't really just called them out as a unique item in the press release. We always have some of those costs. Last year, we had some branch openings going on. And so we always have some of those costs. This is just a change from relative to what we had expected in Q2 at the time we did the guidance. So the plan is to take those 27 locations, some of them we're just using as a starter location to get the market going and we're going to actually close the branches and open a bigger branch of our own once we find a suitable site. In a couple of cases, they did have some bigger locations, and we are going to move our location into theirs. And in some cases, we decided that the facility was inappropriate. That's why Rob said out of the 27, we think we're going to net around 18 locations. So you end up -- and we wanted to retain those staff with the additional costs, get training those people into our systems, getting the inventory in, getting the system set up. And it's a big piece of -- there's a lot going on there in a very short period of the time, which is why the costs were a little bit high. But I'd just point out, we did buy these at a very favorable price. We basically assumed the leases and got paid for some small, minor assets.","Robert L. Wagman","And I think, John, just to add on to what John said, I think in a perfect world, the greenfield would be perhaps desirable because you can pick your locations and you can build it from scratch. But because the opportunity with them going to receivership, we wanted to move quickly. So it will take a little bit longer, but we're obviously excited about the opportunity. And as you noted from the results, I imagine on the UCC stores, Unipart Car Care Centres and the national accounts, we are starting to get some of that business for sure.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And secondly on the specialty business, so the acquired business you got, if you look at that from a gross margin standpoint will as you tie that in with Keystone, will you get -- will that leverage come from buying synergies or basically just from this warehouse transition? Or are the operating models today about the same?","John S. Quinn","In terms of the gross margin, we hope to achieve some procurement synergies over time with that. You don't -- ultimately, the -- it's running at the moment on lower EBITDA margin than a normal business. But we believe we can get it up through the rationalization of the inventory and the distribution system or the warehousing and the distribution system.","Robert L. Wagman","We would definitely get some pickup on the purchasing, but [indiscernible] the synergies that we get from bringing the distributions together.","John S. Quinn","Right. But that's not going to go through the gross margin line, by and large. A lot of that [indiscernible] the facility and warehousing and distribution lines.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question for you -- and I don't want to beat you guys up on the gross margin line. I mean, I recognize that the real leverage in the business model isn't there. But we do get a lot of questions on it. And so I'm just thinking from a trend basis, do you think gross margin could return to above the 40% range again? I mean, how should we think about this kind of longer term?","John S. Quinn","The business has evolved quite a bit from the days when we were enjoying almost 45% margins. So there's a lot of structural things going on in terms of some of the acquisitions we've done. And we've made conscious decisions to adopt paint, for example. The Keystone Automotive acquisition is another example. There is a lower gross margin associated with those businesses. We believe we get those back in terms of better inventory turns or better distribution efficiencies. And by the time we get down to the return on capital, those are still very attractive opportunities for us. The second component is that during a rising commodity environment, you tend to get a little bit of a tailwind and a little bit of a headwind when it's coming down. And if you look at the scrap prices over the course of the last year, so they've actually been drifting down slightly. It could have probably been a little bit headwind to us, not enough to call out on in a particular quarter, other than as I mentioned, Q4 it seems like it's stepping down more dramatically than normal. So I think in terms of those 2 things, you're always going to have the volatility associated with the scrap. But there's some structural things that have changed that are not going to really change dramatically. In terms of the salvage business, that's the third component that I'd always point to. Since the time that business, we've had some compression associated with that with the Manheim Index coming up and more what we're paying for vehicles going up, that remains to be seen. We believe that it's going to come down as we see the cost of cars come down. But when that comes back down, that business is not as large a component of our total company as it was back in the days -- back in, say, 2009 days. So that even if it came back to where the margin it enjoyed before this event, you're not going to see the impact to the total company gross margins. So I think over time, there is some opportunity, as we get bigger to lever some of the procurement opportunities in Europe, for example. I believe there's some more opportunities as we rationalize, for example, Stag-Parkway with the Keystone Automotive operations. There are some opportunities to improve that. But fundamentally, what we pay for vehicles, we're a price taker in terms of the option prices on the salvage business. And we think we're probably already one of the biggest customers of many of our suppliers on the salvage -- on the aftermarket collision side. So there may be some opportunities to improve scale in that. Most of the leverage from the business that comes through the distribution network and through the facility warehouses and the SG&A obviously as we see technology also starting to improve a little bit on that end.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And that's very helpful. And then one final question, just more of a strategic question. If we think about the North American market and the opportunities for further consolidation for you guys, where is the main focus right now? Are you focusing on heavy truck? Or is it in a different area?","Robert L. Wagman","I think it's across all the business, John. Still, there's 6,000 recyclers in the United States. We own roughly 190 locations. So there's great opportunity on the salvage side; heavy truck, absolutely good opportunity; self-serve, we will continue to look at those opportunities as well. But the aftermarket, I would say, pretty well developed. We've got dots on the map pretty much in all of North America. However, we'll continue to look at fully niche businesses, like paint, cooling and that type of stuff. So I believe there's a lot of opportunities left in North America. I always point to Southern California as a great example. We have one dot on a map in our salvage in Santa Fe Springs just outside of L.A. servicing what I believe is probably one of the bigger per capita areas between San Diego and L.A. So a really good opportunity to keep growing all lines of the business. And of course, Europe is still very, very wide open in my mind. We like to say that, roughly after 2 years, we're probably the biggest supplier of mechanical components in Europe in just 2 years. So that is a great opportunity as well.","Operator","Our final question will be from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could update us on the transition in Europe to the 2-step distribution model. Rob, I think you mentioned that the acquisition in the Netherlands might help that along. And would we be talking just about the Netherlands or into France and other countries as well?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. At this point, Bill, we are talking just the Netherlands. We will look at France. We did add a location in France earlier this year. So we're up to 3 locations in France. But in terms of the Netherlands build-out, with the latest acquisition we did that we just announced in August, we're up to 60 locations. And we think the right number is somewhere between 75 and 80. So we're certainly well on our way to getting that done. Now the work is getting them on synergies and rationalizing the businesses, which we have a team over there doing, working on that regularly. And as we mentioned on the last call, too, Bill, we did pro forma reduction in revenue. We were pleased with the organic growth, a big positive this quarter. Last quarter, it was negative. So we are making our strides there. And I suspect by a couple of quarters, we will have reached our target of 75 to 80.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And how does that impact the transition from 3-step to 2-step?","Robert L. Wagman","Well, that will allow us to virtually cover the entire Netherlands with our 2-step model. So we will basically be done with the Netherlands. Now of course, going after the business will be the next step.","I guess, there are no other questions. So thank you, everyone, for your time this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you in February, when we report our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Thanks, and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"12776":["LKQ Corp.

Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. We are delighted to share the results of our most recent quarter with you this morning. I will start by providing some high-level comments on the quarter, and Varun will dig in a bit further into the segments and related financial details before I come back to discuss or our updated 2018 guidance and make a few closing remarks.","As noted on slide 4, consolidated revenue was a record $2.721 billion reflecting a 16% increase over the $2.343 billion recorded in the first quarter of last year. Total revenue growth from parts and services was 15.7% during the first quarter while organic revenue growth in parts and services on a global basis came in at 3.7% with our North American operations leading the charge. As mentioned in the Q4 call, very few companies in our sector are generating organic growth at this level.","Please note, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard effective January 1 of 2018 and that had a negative impact on consolidated revenue growth of just under 40 basis points. So, excluding the impact of the new accounting standard, the global organic growth rate was just above 4%. While the quarter-to-quarter impact is difficult to forecast, we expect the accounting standard impact on our reported revenue growth for the remainder of the year to be less than that recorded in Q1.","Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.49, an increase of 9% as compared to the $0.45 reported for the same period of 2017. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter was $0.55, an increase of 12% compared to the $0.49 for the same period last year. These EPS results were a bit short of our expectations, and during that call, we will provide some insights as to both the headwinds faced and our plans for change.","Let's turn to the operating highlights. As you will note from slide 6, total parts and services revenue for our North American segment grew 8.6% during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American segment during the quarter was 6.5%, well ahead of expectations. We clearly started the year on a high note in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC Information Services, collision and liability related auto claims on a national basis were only up 0.8% in the first quarter, although there were significant regional differences, which were basically a reversal of recent years.","According to the CCC data, the traditional Snow Belt states like Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts, all experienced material growth in repairable claims, while states like Washington, California, Texas, Georgia and Florida saw year-over-year declines in repairable claims. Our revenue largely tracked these regional differences with the Midwest, Northeast and Canadian regions performing extremely strong, while the revenue growth in the South, East and the West was more tempered. Clearly, Mother Nature helped the cause in some of our larger regions. That said, the 6.5% organic growth far outpaced the CCC data supporting our view that we continue to gain market share.","Also, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our performance in Q1 was achieved, while miles driven in the United States were down 0.1% on a nationwide basis in February, although like the claims data, there were significant regional differences.","Organic growth for the aftermarket parts outstripped that of salvage parts, as the repair shops were looking to improve cycle times given the increased volume of work they were processing. Importantly, we continue to see increases in our total aftermarket collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 6.7% and 13.8% respectively in the first quarter.","Finally, as noted last call, we have a new agreement to distribute batteries to the FCA dealerships in North America, and that program had an approximate 100 basis point positive impact on our North American organic growth rate during the quarter. Achieving this robust level of organic growth in North America came at a cost, particularly in our collision parts business, as we incurred incremental operating expense as a percent of revenue to maintain our industry-leading service levels for our customers.","As mentioned, some regions exhibited much better than expected volumes and we had to move inventory around the system in order to have the right parts in the right place to satisfy customer demand. This dynamic had a negative impact on operating margins in the quarter, which Varun will touch on shortly.","Moving to the other side of the Atlantic, our European segment achieved total parts and services revenue of 26.6% during the quarter. Organic revenue growth for parts and services in Europe was 1.2%, which was below our expectations. Acquisitions added an additional 11.3% to revenue growth during the first quarter of 2018, while the strengthening of the euro and sterling continued during the quarter resulting in an FX-related increase of just over 14%.","On the positive side, our operations in Eastern Europe again led the way with high-single-digit organic growth, and our Benelux operations experienced organic growth well above the overall European average. Conversely, our UK operations, which are currently our largest in Europe, produced roughly flat organic growth on a year-over-year basis and generally experienced the softest quarter since we bought ECP in 2011.","While there were a number of moving pieces, I will mention the three biggest factors. First, while we remain highly confident in the long-term benefits related to the new UK warehouse project, known as T2, we have to acknowledge that the full conversion to the automation became more difficult than we had initially modeled. As mentioned in the past, this project involves moving from the utilization of three smaller legacy warehouses to the utilization of the new large highly automated T2 facility and a reconfigured existing facility. T2 is not only a major logistics initiative, but also a complex software project.","While we and our vendors did extensive testing, it was only once the system was under the full load of all the ECP branches earlier this year that some issues began to surface. In particular, we experienced some replenishment issues and related stock availability at both T2 and some of our branches, which in turn led to temporary service issues. We immediately increased head count at T2 to keep the product flowing and implemented key promotional programs to maintain our customer relationships. The final material software patch was installed a few weeks ago. We have worked through the backlog and now the system is fully functional. That said, we are not fully optimized yet, and it will take a couple of quarters to continue to prove the efficiency at T2.","Based on our early April results, it appears that the sales disruption has been rectified. But we still have work to do on the cost side. In the coming quarters, we will move the Andrew Page national distribution center functions and related branch network replenishment to T2. We are confident that these will be executed without the same issues we experienced during the first quarter.","The second point, Europe like the United States had some unusually severe weather. For example, in March, the UK was hit by three separate storms which the media have referred to as the Beast from the East. While these storms dropped an unusual amount of snow on the Greater London area, the biggest impact was experienced in Scotland and the northern areas of England. There were a few days when some of our replenishment trucks were grounded, and many of our customers and our some of branches closed. While harsh weather is generally favorable to our business, in this case, the severity led to a negative impact on the Q1 results.","Third, the timing of Easter appears to have had a larger negative impact than we anticipated. Last year, you may recall, Easter fell in mid-April and firmly in the second quarter, where this year Easter was on April 1 with Good Friday falling into the first quarter and Easter Monday in the second quarter. So again, we had three temporary setbacks.","With respect to Andrew Page, we have received approval to integrate the non-divestiture Andrew Page business. Andrew Page's branch network and national distribution center is scheduled for integration into T2 by July and the head office function should be consolidated by the end of the year. At this time, we are in the process of selling 11 Andrew Page branches, including the nine required by the UK competition authorities and two additional branches that are focused on the commercial vehicle market. We are currently evaluating the bids we have received for these branches.","During the first quarter, we opened up five new branches in Europe including one new location in Western Europe and four in Eastern Europe. So overall, it was a disappointing result for our European segment with the three temporary setbacks impacting our organic growth and EBITDA margins. That said, we believe the longer term impact of the weather will be favorable, the Easter timing impact will benefit Q2 when compared to last year, and that the T2 and Andrew Page integration issues are now within our control and will be resolved in the next couple of quarters. By Q3, we anticipate we will start to see the benefits and we will exit the year with these items well behind us.","And finally, let's move on to our Specialty segment. During Q1, Specialty reported organic growth for parts and services of 0.3%, with most of the slowdown from historical levels coming late in the quarter. The team implemented selected customer and product mix rationalization decisions that we think will yield positive results over the long term. In the short term, however, this meant for growing business in the quarter, which had lower profitability levels while focusing on developing new business at a more acceptable margin. Importantly, unlike our North American segment, which benefits from severe winter weather, the Specialty segment was negatively impacted by the harsh March storms both on the demand side for our RV-focused products as well as our ability to distribute in certain markets.","Moving on to corporate development, in the first quarter, we acquired an aftermarket radiator and related products distributor in Tennessee. During this quarter, we tempered the volume of our acquisitions primarily to digest what we had acquired in 2017, but not closing the door on attractive acquisition opportunities. With that said, I am pleased with the diligence of our development team and our operating team's effort with respect to ongoing integration efforts. We continue to see a robust pipeline of opportunities to acquire businesses that fit with our growth strategy in each of our operating segments.","With respect to the pending acquisition of Stahlgruber announced back in December, we engaged in pre-notification discussions with the EU Antitrust Commission beginning in January and submitted our formal merger notification filing to the Commission on March 9. On April 4, the Commission received a referral request from one EU country asking that part of the transaction be transferred to that country's competition authority for its assessment. The referral request was not a complete surprise, as there was some overlap of business activity in that particular country. The referral request triggered an automatic 10-day extension to the EU review period and we currently anticipate receiving a formal response from the EU Commission on or before May 3.","The operations in the country subject to the referral request represent only a small portion of Stahlgruber's overall revenue and profits, and we believe we will be able to close on the vast majority of the Stahlgruber business during the second quarter. Importantly, our interactions with the Stahlgruber leadership team over the past several months has only reinforced our view that it is a very high quality organization and a strong business, and that will be a terrific addition to the LKQ Europe family of companies.","And now, I will turn the discussion over to Varun who will run you through the details of the segment results.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I will take you through a consolidated and segment results for the quarter and cover our current liquidity situation before turning it back to Nick for an update on full-year guidance.","Nick described the trends behind our reported revenue of $2.7 billion, a new record for the company, so I will start with our consolidated gross margin. As noted on slide 11 of the presentation, the consolidated gross margin percentage was down 100 basis points versus the comparable quarter last year to 38.7%. Roughly 60 basis points of the decrease is attributable to our North America segment with the balance relating to our European segment.","Segment EBITDA totaled $295 million for the first quarter reflecting a $5 million or 1.7% increase over the comparable quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was down 150 basis points to 10.9%. We experienced an 80 basis point increase in our operating expenses largely due to personnel and freight expenses.","During the first quarter of 2018, we also experienced a $1 million increase in restructuring and acquisition-related cost compared to the prior year and an $8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense largely due to acquisitions. With that, operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was down about $9 million or roughly 4% when compared to the same period in 2017.","Non-operating items were favorable by about $2 million versus Q1 2017. Other non-operating income includes foreign exchange gains and losses and various income items such as late payment fees. Interest expense was up $4.5 million, approximately 19% year-over-year due to both higher average balances and interest rates. Pre-tax income during the first quarter of 2018 was $201 million, down $12 million or 5.6% compared to the prior year.","Moving to income taxes, our annual effective tax rate was 26% for the quarter, consistent with the guidance we provided. In the first quarter of 2017, we applied an annual effective rate of 35.25%. So we're showing a $23 million decrease in the income tax provision this year mostly related to the lower U.S. federal tax rate that went into effect with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the first quarter was $0.49, up 8.9%. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, was $0.55 reflecting a 12.2% improvement.","Before I turn to segment commentary, I want to acknowledge the disappointment in our margins in the first quarter. At LKQ, we pride ourselves not only on being able to grow revenues as we have demonstrated yet again, but equally importantly to do so profitably. Our management team strives to obtain operating leverage in our businesses. We haven't lost that discipline, but we also know that there is work to be done to address the margin pressure we faced in the first quarter.","I will provide color on the causes and actions underway designed for our long-term success. Starting with North America on slide 13, gross margins during the first quarter were 43.3%, down 110 basis points over the 44.4% reported last year. The aftermarket business represented about 70 basis points of the decline due to several factors. Firstly, rising costs for our supplies and commodities such as sheet metal and resin and ocean freight resulted in higher costs for our inventory. Our net selling prices, however, did not increase to match the higher inventory costs. Efforts are underway to redress this issue on a location, district and region level to offset this headwind.","Secondly, a large part of the organic growth we experienced came through products such as automotive batteries, owing to the cold winter and certified OE parts. Both are lower margin products, which diluted the overall margin profile relative to the prior year.","Thirdly, our self-serve business also contributed to the lower margin percentage, which initially seems unusual given this rising scrap prices. We are generating more gross margin dollars in 2018 than a year ago, though the gross margin percentage decline, as we process higher cost cars this year. Parts revenue tends to not grow significantly when car costs rise due to higher scrap prices and create a dilutive effect on the gross margin percentage.","In Q1, we also recorded an increase to our reserves associated with returns and receivables that in aggregate cost us approximately $0.02 in EPS. We do not expect a similarly-sized charge to recur in 2018. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in our North American segment increased by 40 basis points compared to last year. We also saw a benefit of about 50 basis points from eliminating shared corporate costs of the sale of the PGW OEM business in March 2017.","Outside of this benefit, overhead expenses were up 90 basis points related to freight, personnel and vehicle costs. With the high level of sales growth in the quarter, we had to rely on more third-party freight and vehicle rentals to maintain service levels. Like many companies, we too are seeing third-party freight cost rise with driver shortages, wage inflation and higher fuel costs. As Nick mentioned earlier, weather impacted certain regions such as the Northeast and Midwest, which experienced strong revenue growth, though this came at a price as we had to bring on expensive temp labor and incur overtime to keep up with demand. The premium for temp labor and overtime contributed to an increase in personnel costs outpacing revenue growth. Training is underway on a variety of fronts to address these headwinds, including adjusting third-party freight codes to reduce freight surcharges, sourcing less expensive freight options and resource management.","Non-operating income and expenses had a positive impact on segment EBITDA of 30 basis points in 2018 due to a non-recurring asset write-off that was recorded in the first quarter of 2017. In total, segment EBITDA for North America during the first quarter of 2018 was $178 million, a 0.9% increase over the prior year.","Looking at slide 14, scrap prices were up 37% over the comparable quarter last year and up 21% from Q4 of 2017. The benefit from scrap reflects the sequential movement in pricing, as car costs will generally follow scrap prices higher or lower over time. We saw a $13 million positive impact on profitability owing to scrap prices, which was $7 million higher than the benefit we experienced in Q1 of 2017.","Moving on to our European segment on slide 15, gross margins in Europe were 35.9% in Q1, a 110 basis point decline over the comparable period in 2017. The decrease is attributable largely to our UK operations and to the mix shift at Riyadh (00:25:52), given the higher growth of the Central and Eastern European region, which has structurally lower margins.","As Nick mentioned in his remarks, we experienced migration issues with our T2 facility in the first quarter that impacted our gross margin on two fronts. First, on the expense side, we incurred unbudgeted cost to address the issue, including increased personnel expenses to manually receive and stock product. And second, we launched promotional pricing to recapture our customers' business. Going forward, we expect to incur some additional period costs in Q2 and incremental COGS, as we sell through the inventory received in Q1.","The effect of these factors drove the lower gross margin percentage in the UK operations, and we expect these to dissipate in the next couple of quarters. We did have some positive news on gross margins in Europe with our centralized procurement yielding a 40 basis point improvement from supplier rebate programs, and additionally our Sator business in the Benelux showed a 70 basis point improvement with specific strength in private label sales and the ongoing move from a three-step to a two-step model in that market.","With respect to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, we experienced a 120 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis versus the comparable quarter a year ago, of which 90 basis points were attributable to higher personnel costs, mostly related to branch openings and the Sator three-step to two-step model evolution which, as we've previously discussed, has higher SG&A costs, though offset by higher gross margin. To a lesser extent, we incurred additional costs in Q1 owing to information technology projects, as we continue to work on solutions to rationalize the many systems we operate across Europe today. European segment EBITDA totaled $76 million, a 4% decrease over last year.","Our goal for Europe remains double-digit segment EBITDA margins over the next 36 months, barring the impact of any acquisitions that may be dilutive and Q1 was a step in the opposite direction. While we believe some of the Q1 issues will be behind us soon, we have more work to do, and John and the European management team are intensely focused on this task.","Turning to our Specialty segment on slide 17, the Warn acquisition from November of last year created some noise in the quarter-over-quarter comparison and Q1 was the first full quarter for the business as part of the LKQ family. The Warn business has continued to perform well and, as previously discussed, has a higher margin profile than the base specialty segment. The base specialty business performed well in spite of flat revenues by protecting its margins. As Nick mentioned, Specialty dropped some low margin business, which had a positive impact on the overall gross margin percentage.","Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in Specialty were higher relative to the prior year, the primary variances related to higher personnel, vehicle and fuel expenses. Segment EBITDA for Specialty was $42 million, up 18.4% from Q1 of 2017. And as a percentage of revenue, segment EBITDA was up 60 basis points to 11.9%, a solid performance by the team, given the revenue headwinds.","Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 18, you will note that our cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter was approximately $145 million. We talked earlier this year about the growth in inventory related to buying opportunities in our North America business. In the first quarter, we started to work down the inventory levels, and for North America, this resulted in a net cash inflow, while Specialty and Europe were outflows owing to lower than expected revenues. We remain optimistic about our ability to generate strong cash flows from operations for the full year of 2018.","CapEx for the quarter was $62 million. The largest capital changes reflect the net pay-down of almost $118 million of debt, largely funded by the cash flows from operations and cash on hand. As we've shown in the past, if we slow down the acquisition pipeline, we have the ability to pay down our outstanding debt given our free cash flow generation.","Moving to slide 19, as of March 31, we had approximately $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding and $246 million of cash, resulting in net debt of about $3.1 billion or about 2.7 times last 12 months' EBITDA. We have approximately $1.5 billion of availability on our line of credit, which together with our cash yields a total liquidity of $1.7 billion. On the 9th of April, we closed \u20ac1 billion of senior notes with \u20ac750 million maturing in April 2026 at a rate of 3.625% and a \u20ac250 million maturing in April 2028 at a rate of 4.125%. We are very happy with the support we saw in the market and the terms we were able to obtain despite the ongoing volatility in the capital markets. Funding the Stahlgruber transaction at a weighted average rate of 3.75% over both an 8-year and a 10-year tranche is a terrific outcome. We plan to mitigate a portion of the holding costs by paying down euro-denominated debt until the closing date.","With that, I'll now turn the call back to Nick to cover the updated guidance.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Varun, for that financial overview. In light of the results achieved in the first quarter, we have adjusted our annual guidance on a few of the key financial metrics. With respect to organic growth for parts and services, we anticipate North America will remain reasonably strong, and the European and Specialty segments will show improvement as we progress through the year. That said, we have adjusted the top end of the full-year guidance range for global organic growth down from 6% to 5.5% to reflect both the 3.7% reported for Q1, a gradual acceleration in Europe in Specialty, and some continued headwinds from the new revenue recognition accounting standard.","In terms of adjusted EPS, we have moved the range down to $2.20 at the low end to $2.30 at the high end to reflect both the actual results for Q1 and the fact that some of our profit improvement plans will take time to catch hold and yield results. That adjustment yields a range for adjusted net income of $685 million to $715 million, down $35 million from the prior guidance. We have also trimmed our capital spending plan a bit to a range of $235 million to $265 million. We also anticipate that the lower earnings will impact cash flow from operations, but the slightly lower revenue growth should require less working capital investment, which partially offsets the earnings impact. Accordingly, the revised cash flow guidance is $625 million to $675 million, a $25 million reduction.","We still believe the effective tax rate will be approximately 26%, and the guidance assumes current levels as it relates to FX rates and scrap steel pricing. Importantly, our guidance does not \u2013 again, does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Stahlgruber. We will come back and update our guidance once that transaction has closed.","In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication our 43,000 employees delivered for the company, our stockholders, and most importantly our customers during the quarter. I am equally proud of our team's commitment to effectively manage the dynamics of the business, which they can control, while not losing focus on growing the business, developing our people, and continuously looking for opportunities to generate leverage and synergies from both our existing and recently acquired operations. Although we are facing some short-term headwinds, I am very confident in our team's ability to effectively implement their respective plans and continue to create significant value over the medium and longer term horizons.","With that, operator, we are now ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning for taking my question.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","I want to ask about North America. The margins, in particular you described the dynamic around some of the incongruities in inventory where you needed them or where you have them, but the 6.5% growth is well above, I think, what you or we expected. And so I'm wondering, as you move through the year, can you leverage that business in light of a stronger growth environment? And how do you manage through that inventory incongruity in terms of availability, as you move through the year?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Hey, Ben, good morning. It's Varun Laroyia speaking here. Listen, you had a great question and I think if you kind of go back to the fourth quarter discussion that we had where we had invested a significant sum into our North America inventory piece, it actually was the right decision looking back as we kind of previously mentioned in light of the strong organic revenue that we experienced. Interestingly, again the revenue growth was in our traditional crash box. So you look at bumpers, look at grills, things along those lines, which essentially paid off. So from that perspective, the inventory investment worked well. The other piece I will share with you is that during the quarter, we essentially \u2013 the net cash inflow from inventory was in North America off the back of the higher organic revenue, although Europe and Specialty was a net cash outflow due to the lower than expected sales.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","And Ben, this is Nick. The reality is, we buy our inventory \u2013 our crash inventory, aftermarket inventory from Taiwan, as you know. We do that literally a couple of months in advance because it takes time not only to get it onto the ship but over to our facilities. Most of our aftermarket inventory is shipped directly to specific warehouses in the U.S. And so those purchases and those shipments were put in place back in Q4 absolutely in anticipation that we're going to have a normal winter.","The reality is the winter hit harder in some places than other, and we actually had to spend a reasonable amount of money moving inventory around in the system, particularly getting it up into the Midwest and Northeast where there was significant demand for our product. That should dissipate because our expectation is that the winter storms are absolutely behind us, although some of them hit here in April in the Midwest, but they are behind us and we will go into a more normal cadence from a geographic perspective. And so we shouldn't have the same level of expense in getting the right parts to the right place to service our customers.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Great. And just one quick clarifier if I could ask on the guidance. When I'm looking at the bridge in your presentation, I see the year-over-year business growth went from $0.14 to $0.09, Andrew Page and Tamworth 2 went away, and then the tax reform rate went from $0.28 to $0.26, contributive to the bridge. I'd be curious, I may have missed this in your explanation, what happened there on the tax rate, and I think we've got an explanation on Andrew Page and T2. And then just on the exchange rate, the one last question there, we're at more favorable rates today than we were at the exit of fourth quarter, so why unchanged there on the $0.03 impact of exchange rates? Thanks.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Ben. So essentially \u2013 let me start off with each of those elements that you mentioned. So the year-over-year business growth piece really is linked in with what we had initially anticipated coming through into our European segment. If you think about the T2 and the Andrew Page accretion that we had shared as part of guidance, which was about $0.03, basically that will not be taking place as of now based on the commentary that we shared a few minutes ago. In addition to that, if you think about some of the headwinds we faced in our North America business, we feel confident of being able to recover those, but in terms of the time that's gone by in Q1, we don't believe we can recover that at this point in time.","And then with regards to the tax reform piece specifically at $0.28, so our overall tax rate is consistent at the 26% rate guidance that we had given essentially due to the lower earnings. Essentially that number kind of comes down by a couple of cents essentially. So, that's the kind of $0.28 to the $0.26 EPS from a tax reform piece.","And then in terms of Andrew Page and T2, that gets eliminated in terms of what we had anticipated. And then the final piece, I think, you had mentioned was in terms of exchange rates, listen the exchange rates are flat versus what we've kind of given guidance. We kind of said that there'd be a $0.03 increase from the prior year. We picked up about $0.015 in Q1, but if you think about the two key trading currencies that we have, both the sterling and also the euro, that's one piece in terms of how the earnings are getting impacted in those markets, number one. And quite frankly, if you see as to where those two currencies are trading this week versus when we had given kind of guidance, they're roughly kind of flat. I think the sterling was at an average rate of about $1.38 at the beginning of the year, it's at $1.39 to $1.40. And then the only two other currencies that we have some fairly substantial trading in is the Canadian dollar which is down and then also the Czech koruna. So overall, the FX piece remains flat at the $0.03 versus what we had guided.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi gentlemen, and good morning and thanks for taking my question.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Jamie.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","If I may just ask a clarification first before I ask my question. I just want to make sure I heard you right, Nick, on your comment a moment ago. It sounded like you had your conference call for the fourth quarter on the 22nd of February, winter happened in March, costs happened in March and you corrected a lot of that in April. Am I hearing that correctly?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yes, Jamie. I mean the reality is we've set guidance during our fourth quarter call, which was late February. At that point in time, we had the January results closed, February was not closed, obviously March was not closed, the weather in the UK had not occurred, the weather impacting the Specialty business had not occurred, the issues at T2 were continuing to accelerate. We haven't really \u2013 we didn't put the final software patch in there until really a couple of weeks ago early April. And so if you want to think of it, the deterioration of the performance during the quarter accelerated as we went through.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","North America specifically though, Nick, if I could just drill in on that, 6.5% organic growth, let's say that holds in 2Q. Could we expect leverage in 2Q or is that unrealistic?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, I think, you were \u2013 probably as Varun indicated, the issues impacting gross margins will probably hang around a little bit longer because those are not quite fixed, those are more \u2013 it can take a little bit more time to get after. But some of the operating expenses, we shouldn't have the same level of freight and expense in moving product around the country in the second and third quarter like we had during the first quarter. I mean the reality is we were scrambling to satisfy the demand from all of our customers in those areas that had gotten really hit hard by the winter weather and accordingly had good demand for the products that we are selling.","And indeed, when the body shops were full up, if you will, they were incredibly focused on cycle time, and there was a shift, there was no doubt. And that's why our aftermarket product grew at a significantly faster rate than the salvage products because we can \u2013 generally speaking, we can get that to the shops faster, same day sometimes, than our salvage product, particularly if the salvage product is coming from a different state or a different part of the region, if you will. But getting that product to the customers quickly has cost. So we do anticipate that we should pick up some benefit on the operating expense line in Q2, Q3.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Yeah. I know I burned through questions there, but \u2013 yeah, go ahead, sorry.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Sorry, Jamie, just to kind of add two key comments to what Nick just mentioned. One, in terms of Q2, the lingering operating costs on the T2 piece that will come through in Q2 also while we're seeing early signs of are actually stepping up, there will be some associated cost, so there's some lingering overhang from a European perspective specifically that I wanted to highlight.","The other piece I wanted to talk to was in terms of the timing, and as to as Nick mentioned, January was on target, on budget and also the initial couple of weeks in Feb were on target also. As I kind of mentioned, we got hit by a couple of cents on our returns reserve and some very specific bad debts related to export revenue. Those kind of activities really take place on a quarterly basis and that really came through when we closed the quarter. So, that's the other piece I wanted to highlight, which obviously, from a timing perspective we would not have known because that was something that came through at the end of March.","James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Well, I've taken my share, guys. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. Appreciate your answers.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Thank you, Jamie.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ryan.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC","So let me ask a couple of questions on Europe. I think you said that sales have been rectified. Is that to mean that organic growth is back to that 4%-plus level here in April?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yes. The Varun's comment on sales being rectified really goes to ECP and some of the issues that we were having with the software in the automation and the like. And so we're all of 25 days into the quarter, but the last couple weeks, the revenue at ECP has been tracking to their original budget. We need to (00:47:21).","Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just on to the margins and profitability, I think you said that you're going to exist the year at more normal levels. So I just want wanted to be clear, do you think by 4Q, you've got all these issues behind you? That's the first part of the question. And then secondly, what do you define as normal EBITDA margins in Europe?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So we do anticipate by the end of the year we're going to be kind of back to historical levels in each of our operating businesses in Europe. Part of what you got to keep in mind is, when the issues start to occur and we needed to keep product moving through T2, the answer there was to bring in a fair amount of incremental labor to manually move some of the product around.","As you know, in Europe, the cost of the central distribution centers gets capitalized into your cost of goods sold. So, all that \u2013 we have a lot of inventory on the shelves today that will end up getting turned, say, in the second quarter, that has that higher level of costs, so you're not going to see \u2013 while the revenue, we think, will come back nicely, you're not going to see an immediate pickup in gross margin until we turn that inventory that has all that temporary labor, if you will, embedded in the cost.","By the time you get to Q4, all that inventory should have been sold through the system and the margins should pick up. The reality is we thought initially that Europe would have margins well into the 9% for the year, given the impact of Q1 and the fact it's going to take some time to kind of work through the issues in the UK, if you will, margins in Europe will probably be in the low to mid-8s on a EBITDA basis for the year as a whole.","Ryan J. Merkel - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is open.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Craig.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Craig.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning. So really this is a board-level question that I think addresses questions that I'm getting from your shareholders. Basically the board historically has incentivized revenue growth, EPS growth and ROE, but with margin improvement seemingly elusive, has the board considered maybe resetting those incentives to align better with margin expansion and ROIC?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","So the references that you made to revenue, EPS and ROE, that is one part of the overall compensation program for the senior folks here at LKQ and that's really the long-term incentive plan. And the other kind of incentives that we all work towards really go to, what we call our management incentive plan, the annual bonus plan, if you will, Craig, and on that it is entirely EPS-driven. In order to hit the EPS targets, we need to generate the margins that we're expecting for the year. So while it's not a direct tie to EBITDA margins, you can't hit the EPS estimates without hitting the margin estimates as well. So it is implicitly embedded in the fact that we need to generate good margins in order to get paid.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And then along those lines, in Europe, I think the plan was to get to 10% EBITDA margins in the next 36 months, which would be 2020. Is that still a realistic target? Thank you.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yes. Craig, it's Varun out here. Yes, listen, clearly Q1 was a step in the opposite direction, but in terms of our commitment to getting to the 10% EBITDA margin level for our European segment, that remains as is. Clearly, it means that we need to kind of get back, and based on the prior question that Nick answered, we were expecting Europe to actually tick a little bit higher than the 8.8% full year for 2017 based on T2 and also Andrew Page. Clearly with Q1 coming in at 7.3%, full year is, as Nick mentioned, between low to mid-8s. But in terms of the exit rate has to be higher based on the second half acceleration coming on segment EBITDA margins in Europe to help us get back on track to the 10% goal that we've previously stated.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Good morning, Bret.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Morning, Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","On the Specialty business, I think you said the word noise with Warn. Was Warn in your opinion sort of inflating the growth rates of Specialty and the number that we saw was more in line, and I guess in the sense that you called out RV as a softer category and related to weather, is there anything particularly going on in that space?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, Bret, let me answer the first part of the question. So, with regards to Warn which we closed on the 1st of November, really the noise was associated with Q4 results with regards to the step up of the inventory as a result of acquisition accounting. So really this was the first full quarter that we had with the business being part of our family.","In terms of the growth, that specifically does not get caught up in our organic growth. We actually called Warn out separately as acquisition growth. So really if you think and you back off that Warn acquisition, the organic growth that we called out at the kind of 30 bps, that basically is the kind of bifurcation to kind of think through the revenue growth piece of it. With regards to RV sales, let me kind of put it back to Nick to give you some sense on that.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So the RV sales were basically in line with the overall growth. I mean, none of the Specialty business, if you will, was dramatically higher or dramatically lower, if you will, than the overall organic, though it did drop off in March. And we think a fair amount of that had to do with the dislocation from the storms because particularly kind of in the traditional winter states, if you will, when all those snowstorms went rolling through, people weren't outfitting their RVs and the like. That may just be a timing issue and may come back, but we're being cautious in our outlook there, Bret.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then the impact from T2 on the UK business, sounds like you had out of stocks as well as a number of other issues over there and some weather. You used to talk about core store sales or stores open for more than 12 months in the ECP business. Can we get a feeling for how that business looked in the quarter and maybe what we're seeing in April? Are we seeing recovery in comp?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So the overall growth in the UK was flat year-over-year as I mentioned in my comments. And the reality is the traditional stores, these stores open more than a year were a little bit flat and the new stores didn't add a whole lot to the overall growth.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","And just to add one point, as you know, we obviously shut certain stores as part of the Andrew Page integration once we had the ability and the stay separate hold order was removed. We did shut 10 stores within the quarter also, which obviously shows as negative organic. So, just want to kind of highlight that piece.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So your comp was flat despite the disruption from the T2 out of stocks?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yes.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And T2 was back running \u2013 I guess, are we running T2 still or are we trying to fix T2 and running off of legacy distribution right now?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","No, no, no, no. You got to understand, it's not like the T2 facility was totally shut down. All of our 225 branches, ECP branches in the UK are being fulfilled exclusively on the traditional service parts out of T2. It was on the margin, there were throughput issues with the facility. So I mean we're processing tens of thousands of fulfillment orders each and every day out of T2. The issue that was happening, Bret, is at some point in time, the trucks need to leave the distribution center to go replenish the branches so they have stock for the next day. We get orders all the way up into \u2013 replenishment orders all the way up to 5, 6 o'clock in the evening, the trucks leave by 8 o'clock in the evening. Some of those late orders weren't getting queued in in time and weren't getting picked. And so, that replenishment wasn't happening. And as you know, in the UK, over half of our revenue in the UK gets delivered within 60 minutes of when we get the call from the customer requesting a product.","So if the product is not in the branch, it's not going to get sold and it was just on the margin, there were some fast-moving parts that didn't get picked in time, didn't hit the delivery truck and weren't in the branch in the next day, okay? It's not like T2 was down for days at a time. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was just the throughput wasn't as strong as it was designed to be, okay? And we were putting software patches in as we are proceeding through the quarter trying to fix the issue working hand in hand obviously with our outside vendors who help design and install the entire system.","You all see the T2 facility in action on our Analyst Day on the 31st of May because we're holding it over at T2. You're going to see it is a massive facility. And so we're just on the margin, we were out of stock in certain parts and so instead of fulfilling our branches at 99.9% of the time, we were fulfilling the branches at a slightly lower rate and that had an impact on revenue. Again based on the two weeks of data that we have from when that last software patch was put into place, the revenue at T2, the fulfillment, the stocking levels all seem to be holding with the original budget. So we have confidence that the revenue will come back. It's not lost forever. We do though have inventory in the shelves that include all that incremental cost. So it's going to take some time to bleed through. And so we won't get the same \u2013 the pickup on the gross margin line won't be as pickup on the revenue line. Hopefully, that helps.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thanks. That does. Thank you.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Thanks, Bret.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","David Kelly - JPMorgan Asset Management","Hey, good morning, guys. It's David Kelly on for Ryan. Just a couple of quick ones for me, and I guess just first trying to bridge the gap between your North American organic growth and the CCC data you referenced, and I know you've spoken about the shifting vehicle population within your age sweet spot, how it's been a headwind for you. Do you think we're reaching that inflection point where the vehicle age mix is again either a positive now or will be a positive in the next, call it, 12 months or so? And then just as a follow-up, how do you view or what's your view on underlying collision repair demand in 2018?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. So we don't see huge shifts in the car park, which is I think where your question was headed. Clearly as we've included in our standard investor materials that sweet spot, if you will, in 2018 as we've said for some time is coming back into our favor, if you will. And you think about the number of cars that are in that 3- to 10-year timeframe, which is really the sweet spot for collision products, if you will. Again, there are big, big regional differences in the CCC data as relates to the growth. And those states that I talked about, think about the high population Snow Belt winter states, we had exceptionally strong results. The West and the Southeast were \u2013 we still had growth, but not as high.","But when you think about the 6.5% organic, again about 100 basis points of that came from that new program that we have in distributing batteries, which says everything else was up 5.5%. The core aftermarket collision product was up well north \u2013 well north of the 5.5%. Engines and transmissions were in that 5% to 6% range. Collision product from salvage, again because people were buying more aftermarket than salvage, was kind of in the lower single digits. Our glass business was double digits, which was terrific. Some of the product lines that have been slow growers over the past several quarters continue to be slow growers. Paint was flat. Paint accessories if you think about sandpaper and Bondo and tools and the like was down just a little bit. Cooling continued to be negative, if you will. But again, it was a terrific quarter from a overall North American revenue perspective.","Again, Mother Nature absolutely helped this out because the winter was \u2013 from our perspective, particularly in the Snow Belt states whereas a \u2013 for us a better than average winter, more severe winter, which leads to more collisions. And the CCC data would absolutely support that with a number of those states having repairable claims in the 5% to 6% growth rate, if you will. The Western, Southwest and the Southeast, most of those states were actually negative year-over-year. So we're comfortable that North America will continue to grow nicely for the rest of the year. I'm not going to say that we're going to be able to do 6.5% because we know that Mother Nature helped us, but we think it's going to remain very healthy. And we think that's in part because of our competitive position, in part because of the continued soft tailwinds related to the car park and the sweet spot. The reality is we think alternative part usage is again trending up just a little bit at a time but every little bit helps, and then obviously a good weather condition. So, hopefully, that answers your question.","David Kelly - JPMorgan Asset Management","Yeah. That's great. I really appreciate all the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","(01:04:01) for giving me the chance to ask the questions. So, Nick, I have an AB kind of my \u2013 on my read-through what you're saying is that the top line is going to be okay relative to your original expectations. You're bearing more costs to execute that for the reasons you've said, I think that's accurate. Specifically to 2Q, am I right reading through that 2Q EBITDA in North America and again Europe will be up versus 1Q on a margin basis, but down year-over-year? But I'll reverse the negatives, it gradually starts lifting each subsequent quarter to finish the year at the levels you've adjusted to. Is that the right way to think about what I'm hearing?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah. Well, again, Michael, as you know, we don't provide quarterly guidance if you will. But traditionally, you can see how our margins flow from a quarter-to-quarter basis. We would anticipate that those quarterly flows, if you will, will occur if you're in 2018 as well, particularly in North America.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So I just want to make sure do you expect the trend sequentially to improve?","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","We think that the traditional trends of how margins flow throughout the year will be consistent in 2018. Last year, if you will, between Q1 and Q2, Q1 was 14.6% and Q2 was 14.4%, so pretty close to the same. We would probably expect something similar where Q2 margins would be very similar to Q1 margins here in 2018. We may get a little bit of a pickup as I indicated on the operating expense line, but again some of the programs we're putting in place aren't going to fully catch hold until the back half of the year.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's the clarity I was trying to get. And then one last follow-up, this is a tough question, but I got to ask it. So, what was the message you were giving about the outlook for the business when you were in the bond market at the end of March or beginning of April?","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Taken as a whole, our business continues to be incredibly strong. Our credit stats even with \u2013 the softness in Q1, the credit stats really don't move it hardly at all. I mean our leverage ratios and the like aren't as impacted by $0.01 here or there in EPS. And obviously, we were able to price on a very attractive basis.","Varun Laroyia - LKQ Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. And Michael again just to add to what Nick just said, apart from the credit stats, the overall underlying cash flow generation of the business, that continues to move in the right direction. So even in a sequential quarter basis Q4 going into Q1, we kind of more than doubled our overall free cash flow in any case. Nothing has been impacted from that perspective, all the kind of inventory that we had invested in in the fourth quarter in North America with growth coming through actually was a net cash inflow from the inventory piece of it. So the underlying credit stats, the underlying improving credit history the company has, the underlying cash generation abilities of the business, nothing has changed from that perspective. And the bigger picture of things, we had a pretty robust outlook in any case. And over the long term, we price two tranches, 8 years and 10 years. We are building the business for the long term and we believe that that will continue.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So just to be clear, you told the bond market, when you're in the market that you're going to have a soft first quarter, but showed them all the good fundamental credit trends and that's why \u2013 because it priced well, but they knew that you had a soft first quarter.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","No. The bond market, Michael, is much less focused on quarter-to-quarter earnings. There were no discussions about quarterly flow when we were on the roadshow.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I just wanted to make sure I understood that. Okay, thank you.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mr. Zarcone.","Dominick P. Zarcone - LKQ Corp.","Well, we thank everyone for your time here today. I know we ran a little bit long, but given the release, we wanted to make sure we could get to everybody's questions. Again, we need to leave this conversation recognizing that LKQ is a very strong company. We are very optimistic about the prospects of our company, not only just for the rest of the year, but for a long time to come.","We have the preeminent competitive position in almost every business that we have around the globe, and we've got 43,000 people working hard to service our customers each and every day. We run into some headwinds, we understand that, we have plans in place to make corrections. It's not going to happen overnight, but we're very confident in our ability to get back to our traditional levels of growth and profitability in each of our businesses. And that's the message I'd leave with you here this morning.","So again, we thank you for your time and your participation in our call, and we look forward to seeing many of you in Tamworth at the end of May for our Analyst Day and then obviously chatting with you again in July when we report our second quarter results. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13471":["LKQ Corp. (NASDAQ:LKQ) Q1 2016 Earnings Call April 28, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Joseph P.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Boutross. You may begin.","Joseph P. Boutross - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Devon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Rob Wagman and Nick Zarcone. Please refer to the LKQ website at lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning, as well as the accompanying slide presentation for this call.","Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release as well as the slide presentation.","And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review of the quarter with a few high level financial metrics, followed by an update on our operating segments in the various macro trends, each segment witnessed in their respective markets and conclude with an update on our corporate development achievements in the quarter. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our Q1 financial performance.","Turning to slide three, Q1 revenue reached a record $1.92 billion, an increase of 8.3% as compared to $1.77 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Net income for the first quarter of 2016 was a $107.7 million, an increase of 0.6% as compared to $107.1 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $128.7 million, an increase of 10.2% as compared to the $116.8 million for the same period of 2015.","Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31 2016 was unchanged from the $0.35 for the first quarter of 2015. It is important to note, however, that the Q1 2016 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.07 per share resulting from restructuring and acquisition related expenses, losses on debt extinguishment, amortization of acquired intangibles, change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, and an adjustment for gains associated with the hedging the Rhiag purchase price. So on an adjusted basis, EPS grew 10.5% year-over-year in Q1. Nick will provide more specifics on the adjustment shortly.","Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.3% in the quarter, a solid number, given what mild weather headwinds we faced in North America and Europe and a tough comp in 2015.","Turning to North America. According to the National Center for Environmental Information, March snow cover in the U.S. was 48% lower than the average coverage witnessed from 1981 to 2015. And the second smallest in the 50-year period on record was February and March of 2012 ranking third and fourth respectively. And February of this year was not far behind, recording 13th smallest level over that same 50-year period. With that as a backdrop, North America delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.9% in the quarter, which compared to the 3.6% achieved in Q1 2012 is solid, given we experienced similar weather anomalies in each of those quarters.","During Q1, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.8% increase over Q1 2015. During Q1, our pricing at auction increased over Q1 2015 by 9%. But we were also buying a younger vehicle by over one year or 13% younger. This younger vehicle procurement strategy positions us to take advantage of the inevitable reduction in the average age of the vehicle being repaired, a direct result of the increase in the SAAR rates.","Illustrating this point, during the quarter, the average model year age of a vehicle being repaired was younger by over a year compared to the same period in 2015. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings, as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 18.5% and 58.4% respectively year-over-year in the quarter","In our self-service retail business, during Q1, we acquired over 125,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 25% increase over Q1 2015. Compared to the prior year, we increased our self-service procurement in the quarter to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher quality vehicles in this line of business, given the year-over-year decline in scrap pricing. As of way, we have seen a stabilization of scrap pricing.","Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Systems. In March of 2015, we introduced LKQ's recycled parts offering through this platform with initial base of 100 shops in Portland, Grand Rapids, and Oklahoma City. From a base of zero and within less than a year, the initial results are encouraged. Through the end of Q1, LKQ's recycled parts are now accessible to over 2,500 shops in virtually every major city throughout the United States.","During Q1, the revenue and number of aftermarket parts purchased processed through the CCC platform, through 82% and 84% respectively year-over-year. And lastly, on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we've identified several significant opportunities in four key areas, with one being sales force effectiveness and the second one being (7:06) optimization. During the quarter, our sales responsibilities were separated from our operations across the United States, resulting in a more focused structure.","This structure has three regional sales vice presidents, a leadership team of district sales manager and inside sales managers as well. We now have a geographically focused sales force that is positioned to compete at a local level allowing our broader team to handle increased call volumes. During the quarter, we implemented additional sales KPIs focused on increasing total talk time, outbound calls and peer coaching. The initial results of these KPIs are positive with total talk time and outbound calls increasing 27% and 15% respectively in the quarter.","Under our peer coaching, we have engaged each inside sales manager to increase his or her time on the floor with their sales force. But we also have each sales manager spend 18 hours per week on the floor engaging in side-by-side coaching, which will increase sales skills with higher volume of sales per rep and simultaneously improve the overall experience to our customer. Though this coaching structure may create a slight head room with sales, the long-term benefit of driving the performance of our top sales people should lead to reduction in the overall size of our sales force.","In addition, during the quarter, we made great strides with the implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we've selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. Roadnet's fleet in mobile management software provides strategic territory and street level route plans, multi-stock vehicle routing and scheduling, wireless dispatch, vehicle telematics, fuel management and real-time vehicle GPS tracking.","Our current utilization rate with Roadnet represents 65% of our North American fleet which today is accounting for over 2,500 vehicles driving over 140,000 miles and make over 22,000 stops on a daily basis. Our goal is to be at a 100% utilization by the end of 2016.","Now moving on to our European operations. In Q1, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9% and acquisition growth of 9.9%, which was offset by a decrease of 4.5% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q1, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.4%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.8%, a solid performance given that ECP had one less selling day year-over-year.","During the quarter, ECP did not open any additional branches, providing our team the bandwidth to focus on capturing incremental margin expansion year-over-year in Q1. During Q1, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 15.5%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q1 weather in the UK, a tough comp in 2015 and again with one less selling day.","Now turning to our Sator business. During Q1, Sator drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.2%, its highest quarterly rate since we acquired the business in May of 2013. We believe that our investments in 2014 and 2015 to convert our distribution model from three step to two step is predominantly responsible for not only this acceleration of organic growth, but also the year-over-year improvements in gross and EBITDA margins.","And now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 19.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 10.8%. I'm also pleased with the margin expansion at Specialty realized in the quarter, which Nick will cover shortly.","During the quarter, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating two additional warehouses into our network. Also the Coast administrative synergies continue to be ahead of our schedule. In addition, our previously mentioned Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State were both fully operational at the end of Q1.","Now on to corporate development. On March 21, 2016, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of Rhiag, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Rhiag operates through 252 distribution centers and 10 warehouses and serve more than 100,000 professional clients in 10 European countries.","And on April 21, 2016, the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. With the acquisition of PGW and our entrance into the sizable $3.5 billion automotive glass market, we continue to grow our industry leading position and product offerings to further serve the needs of our professional repair customers. PGW's offerings are complementary to LKQ's existing business and product offerings. And together, our respective teams now have the technology, products and expertise to introduce automotive glass to LKQ's global growth strategy.","I am also pleased to announce that PGW has secured two new material OE contracts since we announced the acquisition in late February. I am excited to welcome the folks at both Rhiag and PGW to the LKQ team. In addition to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, during the first quarter of 2016, the company acquired an additional wholesale salvage business based in Sweden.","At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of our three segments, before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016, now that the Rhiag and PGW transactions have closed.","The short version of our financial performance in the first quarter of 2016 is that we had a very good quarter and taken as a whole was right in line with our expectations. We experienced solid revenue and earnings growth. And the headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar have started to abate. To be clear, Rhiag closed in late March and was included in our first quarter for only a few days. PGW just closed last week and had no impact on our Q1 results.","As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $1.9 billion representing an 8.3% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.5% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 20% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals on a year-over-year basis.","The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.3% from organic, plus 6% from acquisitions, for constant currency growth of 12.3%, before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.8% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each of the businesses as I walk through the segment results.","As noted on slide 10 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 20 basis points to 39.6% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 40-basis point improvement from operations, largely in Europe offset by a 20-basis point decline due to revenue mix, as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, continued to outpace that of our other operations.","We lost about 50 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our North American operations. This was due primarily to the continued impact of lower revenue from scrap and core, which was down $39 million on a year-over-year basis, and particularly impacted our self-service operation. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution cost as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation.","Segment EBITDA totaled $237 million for the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.3%, a 20-basis-point decrease over the 12.5% recorded last year.","The increase in segment EBITDA was offset by an increase in restructuring costs. And operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was flat in dollar terms, and down a bit as a percent of revenue when compared to the same period of the prior year. The restructuring items primarily relate to expenses connected to the Rhiag acquisition.","You will note a couple of relatively large non-operating items in our income statement during the first quarter of 2016, including a loss on debt extinguishment and significant other income. As you may recall, we amended our credit facility at the end of January. In addition, we repaid all of Rhiag's debt shortly after closing.","Collectively, that accounted for approximately $26.7 million of one-time expenses related to unamortized issuance costs on the former credit agreement and the prepayment penalty associated with the high cost Rhiag debt. Going in the other direction, we hedged the anticipated payment for the Rhiag acquisition, and given the movement in the euro between when we set the hedge and the closing date, we had sizable gain, about $18 million on the hedge. On a combined basis, the net effect of these one-time items was a negative impact on pre-tax margins, which contracted by about 90 basis points to 8.6%.","Our net tax rate during the first quarter was 34.75%, down from 35.5% in 2015 and even with the annual guidance we provided this past February. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, which was flat with last year. However, adjusted EPS before restructuring charges, a loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain and intangible asset amortization was $0.42 a share compared to $0.38 reflecting the 10.5% improvement.","As mentioned, the impact of scrap and currency fluctuations have abated quite a bit and collectively impacted EPS by less than a penny during the first quarter. While we have included the details on scrap and currencies in the presentation material, given the minor impact, I am happy to say I won't be spending much time on those topics during this discussion.","As highlighted on slide 11, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This will become more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW and you will begin to see a shift in the second quarter results.","And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the first quarter of 2016 increased to $1.088 billion or a 4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 7.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was primarily due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. The 7.3% growth in North American parts and services was a combination of 4.9% organic growth and 3.1% acquisition growth, offset by a 70 basis point FX-related decline, due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar.","There is no doubt that the mild weather had an impact on our revenue, as collision claims were down in many states. But it's hard to quantify the impact, and in the end, we simply need to work through Mother Nature. All-in-all, this was a solid quarter in revenue for our North American business.","Gross margins in North America during the first quarter were 42.7%, up just a few basis points. With respect to operating expenses, we lost about 80 basis points of margin, compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Our self-service unit experienced an increase in operating expenses, but meaningfully lower revenue due to the significant decline in commodity prices. And as a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis.","For the North American segment as a whole, the impact of the lower revenue from the sale of scrap and other commodities increased operating costs as a percent of revenue by approximately 110 basis points. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs, relative to last year, picking up about 20 basis points of margin, as diesel averaged $2.08 a gallon, compared to $2.92 a gallon last year, a 29% decline.","Importantly, we began to experience some preliminary benefit from our productivity initiatives during Q1 with our non-inventory related purchasing activities benefiting from about $400,000 of savings. We would expect this to pick up as we move throughout the year. The inventory related savings will begin as we purchase inventories at new negotiated prices, the products are received and placed in our warehouses and we turn the inventory.","In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the first quarter was $147 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.6% in Q1 of 2016, down from 14.3% reported in the comparable period of prior year. The impact of lower revenue from commodities should dissipate in the second half assuming we get to more comparable scrap pricing.","Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the first quarter accelerated to $547 million from $487 million, a 12.2% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the first quarter was 6.9%, reflecting the combination of 7.4% growth at ECP and 6.2% at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 9.9% increase in revenues, which includes only two weeks of activity for Rhiag.","So, on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 16.8% for the quarter. These gains were offset by a 4.5% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.1%, a 110 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continued to benefit from approved procurements in the UK in the internalization of the gross margins from the acquisitions in the Netherlands. These are the highest first quarter gross margins we have achieved in Europe in several years.","As mentioned, when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December given the three-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland. Rhiag has lower gross margins than either ECP or Sator, and beginning in the second quarter, you will see the impact of that on our consolidated European gross margins. With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 10 basis points increase on a consolidated European basis. We started paying rents and related property costs on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England, which we call T2 back in February.","The incremental costs related to this project (24:48) in Q1 were about \u00a31.2 million or about $1.8 million, which reflects a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. Offsetting some of this increase in expense were some FX gains related to hedges utilized to manage our foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases in the UK. European EBITDA totaled $57.5 million, a 23.6% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 was 10.5% versus 9.5% last year, a full 100 basis point improvement even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project.","Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the pound had declined 6% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. Given the significant margin improvement, constant currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 28.6%, which we believe is robust.","Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the first quarter totaled $288 million, a 19.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 10.8% was very strong, while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 9.4% to revenue growth.","Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the first quarter increased by about 20 basis points compared to last year, due to some favorable product mix and favorable inventory capitalization adjustments related to the acquisition integration activities.","Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 30 basis points. We continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network, as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices and lower advertising expenses. These savings were in part offset by higher cost related to the two new distribution facilities added in late 2015 and slightly higher freight expense.","EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $32 million, up 25% from the first quarter of last year and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 50 basis points to 11% in 2016 compared to 10.5% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and the first quarter is typically pretty strong as demonstrated by the graph in the lower right corner of slide 16. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year.","Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on slide 17, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $119 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the quarter, we deployed $625 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $50 million to fund capital expenditures and $575 million to fund the acquisitions and other investments. The latter amount includes the monies paid for Rhiag, net of the hedging gain on the purchase price and net of the proceeds from the previously announced sale of our interest in the Australian joint venture.","The Rhiag acquisition was financed by drawing down on our line of credit, thus the big inflow from financing. We closed the quarter with about $229 million of cash, of which $177 million was held outside of the United States. The big increase in foreign cash relates to the amounts on Rhiag's balance sheet at the time of acquisition.","At March 31, we had about $2.8 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected the monies borrowed to complete the Rhiag acquisition in late March. That quarter-end balance does not include any borrowings related to PGW as that transaction closed in Q2. On a pro forma basis, taking into account the PGW closing, our net debt was approximately $3.3 billion or about three times pro forma EBITDA.","Also, we completed a very successful \u20ac500 million issuance of senior notes in early April, and we used those proceeds to in part pay down the revolving credit facility used to finance the Rhiag transaction. The key terms of that offering were bullet maturity of eight years and a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. Today, our total availability under the new credit facility is approximately $1 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the growth of our business.","Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016 to include the impact from the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. Again, Rhiag closed in late March and PGW in late April, so we effectively will record a tad more than nine months and eight months of the respective results in 2016. As relates to the organic growth rates for parts and services, we continue to be comfortable with the range of 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience.","Our range for adjusted EPS, which again now excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization is $1.76 at the low end to $1.86 per share at the high end with the midpoint of $1.81 a share. Again, this includes the anticipated impact from our ownership of Rhiag and PGW for nine months and eight months respectively in 2016.","The EPS guidance also assumes that the pound sterling and the euro remain at budgeted levels of $1.45 and $1.10 respectively, and importantly that scrap remains at current levels as well. Based on our shares outstanding, that range implies an adjusted net income of approximately $545 million to $575 million, with a midpoint to $560 million.","Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%. As part of the PGW transaction under U.S. GAAP, we need to mark the closing date inventory up to market value, which means about an $8 million to $12 million increase in the inventory valuation. This amount will get amortized as a non-cash expense as we turn the inventory. It won't affect the adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it will be a one-time impact on diluted net income and diluted EPS in Q2 and perhaps a bit in Q3.","I believe all the analysts have adapted to the new adjusted EPS format, which we greatly appreciate, and that will ensure we have consistency in the EPS estimates. The appendices to this presentation include the relevant reconciliations for prior year periods.","Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $575 million to $625 million, with the midpoint of $600 million, and finally, we set the adjusted guidance for capital spending at $200 million to $225 million.","And at this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap things up.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nick. To summarize, I am proud of the momentum we have created with our Q1 performance, our recently completed strategic acquisitions and our recent financings. Combined these achievements position LKQ well to deliver another year of organic and acquisition-related revenue growth in 2016 that has us now annualizing in excess of $10 billion of revenue.","Obviously, we can't predict weather patterns, so we remain focused on the things we can control, which include continuing to offer an attractive value proposition to our insurance carrier partners, maintaining and increasing our industry leading fulfillment rates and providing superior and responsive customer service to the professional vehicle repair and supply businesses we serve, all supported by a highly effective and unmatched alternative parts distribution network in North America. And most importantly, I believe we have a stellar team of 35,000 plus fellow employees dedicated to carrying on our mission globally, and I want to thank each and every one of them for their collective efforts.","Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Hey.

And what I'm most excited about is we still haven't introduced our other product lines, being used, re-man to a (34:55) great extent. So, there's still opportunity there as well, but we believe we're taking market share. A little bit of a headwind there actually with the strong SAAR rate. We have to wait for those cars obviously to get into the independent aftermarket. So, we're very pleased with that number, it is very strong and we expect it to continue.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then on the PGW side, you mentioned you picked up a couple of contracts since you initially announced the deal. Can you share with us what those are? And is there a capacity constraint as far as your production capability or is it just the ability to outsource that class?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We can't share who they were, but they are locked in for future models. And as far as capacity, we do have the capacity to continue to take on new accounts. So that's not going to be a problem.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And then a housekeeping, do you have a feeling for what alternative parts were as a percentage of North American repair?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The last \u2013 we did that annually update, and it was at \u2013 at the end of 2015, Bret, it was still 36%.","Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bret.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. So in your self-service business, you accelerated the number of vehicles you purchased pretty materially, up 25%. Obviously, scrap still \u2013 trends have improved, but I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on that business line. Do you think we're reaching a turning point there?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think the downturn in scrap, Ben, allowed us to buy a better car for less money and that's what's really driving the revenue there. We're putting better cars through the system and they are plentiful. So long term, scrap has ticked up slightly finally, so it seems to have bottomed out nicely. So we plan on continuing to buy aggressively in that line of business. Business has been very good there.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then, we've heard some news recently about pretty severe hailstorms in the southern U.S., Texas primarily. Can you talk a little bit about what you think this means for your business going forward? Obviously, you've got the glass business now, it's good for your collision business as well, but just curious to hear your thoughts there.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, absolutely. When we look at Q1, it was really a tale of two countries. We meet with CCC regularly, and they gave us some stats on the Northeast and the Mid-West being down and the number of \u2013 accident frequency and that was not the case in the Southwest and the West. And we actually had a strong double digit organic growth in both of those markets. So we do expect \u2013 I did see an ad by Caliber Collision that they are booked through September for collision repair. So, we do expect some nice tailwinds coming out of that market.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Great. And then just one housekeeping...","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","(37:41) PGW will also be able to realize that benefit as well.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Great. And then, just one last housekeeping. You said your guidance reflects a continuation of current scrap steel prices. Should we think of that $93 per ton that you realized in the first quarter as the price that's embedded in your guidance?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ben, this is Nick. Good morning. The $93 was the average for the quarter. Actually, as we came to the end of the quarter, was up a little bit, so we're kind of sitting right at around triple digits, which is great to be out of double digits, if you will. And so, that's really what's embedded in the guidance. Again, it's up a little bit which is good, but it's not up meaningful enough to really drive any sort of EPS accretion or...","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. So, it's end of the quarter price?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Best of luck.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nate, good mooning.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","And so, if we kind of \u2013 and I know, Nick, you pointed this out in terms of you can't really tease it out in terms of the weather impact in the first quarter. But if we exclude that and kind of come in April a little bit in terms of more mile patterns year-over-year, can you talk about \u2013 like I mean, I would assume that the tailwinds are still existing in terms of increased miles driven, more parts per repair, and you talked about the more certified parts.","I mean I would assume that, kind of moving out of that first quarter on the weather comp issue that you're still feeling good about the trends in the business and the tailwinds there.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Absolutely, no change in the longer term tailwinds, Nate. We feel very good about what's happening to the car park. The age of the car park. The number of miles driven. The distractions on the road. I mean, all that is absolutely no change from our perspective. As Rob noted, there are parts of the countries that had a soft winter, particularly the Northeast, Mid-West and importantly Canada, which Rob didn't mention. The shops did not have a big backlog in April. But by the time you hit May and June, all that's flushed through the system and it shouldn't be an issue.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then...","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just to add one more thing to that \u2013 what Nick said. The auctions and I think as a result of some of the flooding that's happened on the Houston and the hailstorm, we expect the auctions to be very healthy here for a while.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then kind of on the facility expense line, as we've talked about, you have the new distribution facilities with Specialty, you have the UK one that's starting to come into costs. Should we anticipate that that line item continues to go up a little bit particularly as we move through the UK? And if so, is the UK still on track to kind of take out what was originally thought to be $0.02 to $0.03 this year?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nate, this is Nick. Yes, actually $0.03 is our estimate. We've quantified that I think in past calls of about $13 million of total expense. As noted in my comments a bit earlier, it was about $1.8 million for the first quarter. So we still have the better part of $11 million of costs related to the T2 facility to absorb in the back three quarters of the year. And so that will be a slightly larger kind of weight that we need to bear as relates to facility cost.","Again the two new facilities from the Specialty segment that we introduced in Q4 of last year, those are, as Rob indicated, fully up and running. The impact of that expense should begin to moderate a little bit. And we have kind of rearranged some of our people as to where they are hitting on the P&L. Rob talked about the change in the sales structure. That meant there was also a change in our operating structure as well. And so, there's a little bit of cost that was moving out of actually selling expense and up into facilities and warehousing expense.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","A little bit northward movement.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","And as Rhiag and PGW come on, would we expect that line item to again take a little bit of a relative jump before kind of paring down as you kind of consolidate facilities and routes and et cetera.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, again, there will be no kind of distribution synergies coming out of Rhiag, because they operate in geographies where we don't operate today. So we're not going to be consolidating warehouses or distribution routes and the like. They're going to operate as they have operated. It's going to take us a little bit of time on PGW. The only natural synergies will be in their aftermarket business where they have 120 locations around the country, we have 300 locations. We do believe that over time, there will be the ability to combine some of those operations and the like but you shouldn't see anything on that front near-term.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one last housekeeping, Nick. Do you have, now that the deals have closed, a rough amortization number for us to think about in terms of \u2013 if you went back to a non-adjusted amortization earnings?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The best that we have right now, Nate, is what we provided back when we announced the transactions in December and in late February. Again, we're just working through the opening balance sheet on Rhiag, that will probably. We still have some valuation work that we have outside experts helping us with as to how much the excess purchase price over book value is going to go to goodwill versus amortized assets, and that relates to both transactions. So, we'll come back and provide a better estimate, once we have some of that work done.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the time, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Wanted to ask on the cost of goods sold side in North America with Manheim coming down here quite precipitously last few months, it would seem to be a benefit to your margins. But at the same time, you noted you're buying a higher quality and fewer higher quality vehicles. So, just wanted to get a better understanding of how we should think about modeling gross margin, imagining it's a benefit for 2Q and the balance of the year, but if you could help us sort of understand the magnitude there.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Jamie. This is Nick. We're not anticipating a major pickup in \u2013 or a benefit on the cost of goods sold line. Again, the Manheim index is down a little bit, which ultimately helped us at the auctions a little bit. That said we are buying a newer car. You would have noticed that the average cost of the vehicle that we're buying was actually up, I think was about 9% in Q1 relative to last year. Now, our goal is to get more parts dollars off the car.","And actually what we've been very consistent over the last several years in mentioning, as we've started to move towards buying a newer vehicle, while the gross margin dollars that we can get off that car go up, actually the gross margin percentage actually comes down a little bit. So there's probably going to be a little bit of a yin and a yang. We're not anticipating a major movement either way as it relates to our salvage cost of goods sold.","James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So if I'm hearing you correctly and if I can just paraphrase, it sounds like you're assuming X for your cost of purchase of a vehicle and that's roughly flattish if you will year-over-year, but the amount you can get in terms of per parts \u2013 and Rob, you used the example of the F150 tail light, I believe, and with a blind spot detection, is about 10x with the predecessor tail light cost. So it sounds like COGS is flattish but you're going to be making more per vehicle. Do I hear that correctly?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just a quick question and apologies if you've gone through this on the CGW call or any detail in the slide that we missed it. But to our understanding, it's a little different to take the glass and put it into trucks and some trucks need to be specialized to handle different types of glass. And I'm thinking more on the sort of distribution synergies over the longer term side here. So is there any incremental investments you need to make into either trucks or whether its existing trucks or new trucks? Or just how should we think about that, or conversely, is there really not much to worry about as it relates to the handling of the glass?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, as far as the warehousing goes, Jamie, no changes there whatsoever, the racking is identical. But you are correct. The trucks are different. They have a different handling capability. What our plan would be to do is, we start integrating those businesses, and as trucks retire, we're retiring almost 600 trucks a year, we're replacing because of our large fleet. Those will be retrofitted appropriately to carry both glass and salvage. So, we don't see it being a major hindrance given the timeframe we have to integrate the businesses first.","James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And at this point, it's maybe too early to start thinking about sort of balance sheet and P&L impacts and sort of percentage that we should attribute to that, is that fair?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That's fair.","James J. Albertine, Jr. - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Awesome, thanks guys, and best of luck in the second quarter.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jamie.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, following upon on Bret's earlier question, have you run any scenarios at ECP, to evaluate the impact of T2 on your fulfillment rates or ultimately your growth rate there?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We do know Craig that, we're going to have a lot more capacity of the store products. We run at about a 98% fill rate today. What we think we'll be able to do though is rather than having, in some cases, where we have limited, much limited supply in the field, will be able to put more in the field because of these regional hubs we're developing as well. So, we will have a lot better ability to backfill quickly. So, we do think our speed to market will be quicker, as a result. And of course, just with the automation, we do expect a lot more efficiencies as well, both in terms of pulling quicker and getting to our customers even quicker as well.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Do you see any impact on inventory turns as a result of T2?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The near term, the inventory will go up a bit, Craig, only because we're going to be filling that warehouse while we will still have inventory in the two warehouses that we'll ultimately shut down. That's more of a timing issue. Ultimately it'll work through the system. The inventory may go up a bit but it's not going to be a wholesale change.","The key of what the large national distribution facilities allow us to do is that's where some of the longer dated inventory is held, and being able to have that and get it to our branches when needed quickly and through some of the automated picking processes and alike, that's the real benefit of that. So near-term inventory will go up a little bit as we're working through the transition going from four facilities down to two facilities because you need to have inventory ready for the customer but longer term, there shouldn't be a major impact.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And then finally on your projects with Accel Partners on efficiency, are you in a position at all to quantify or at least help us frame, what you think the financial implications could be once you're up and running on these major projects?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, we'll report that really as we go. When we were in New York last month for the Investor Day, Justin Jude had mentioned tens of millions of dollars. Ultimately on a run rate basis, we're not going to get there, Craig, here in 2016. Again on the non-inventory related purchasing, again, we were at $400,000 in the first quarter, that will probably double in the coming quarters. So there will be, I don't know, $2.5 million to $3 million potential savings rolling through in 2016 related to things like logistics and our telecom and our corrugate and supplies buying and office supplies and all that kind of activity.","The real key will come in from actually the aftermarket product that we procure from Taiwan. Again, we're just beginning to buy some of that at new pricing. Some of it's going to be based on demand that we have for those parts, as to how much we need to buy and the ability to make sure we retain the savings in-house, as opposed to passing any of that along to our customers. So, we'll be able to document that on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just one follow-up to what Nick said, Craig. Even though we've only been with PGW a week, we've already put their transportation guys with our transportation guys and we're working on ocean freight to leverage that. So, We're quickly already addressing that with the new acquisitions.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Tony.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","First question I had with respect to some of these initiatives on Roadnet and as well as on the sales force. I wonder if you could add a little bit more color in terms of which one do you think over the long term will give you a bit more of a benefit or greater efficiencies. And with respect to particularly the sales force initiative, some of the KPIs that are being implemented, are they going to drive overall higher fill rates or traction or customer service scores, or what should we think about in terms of the near-term benefit?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. If I rank them both, I would say, Roadnet's got the bigger impact for a couple of reasons. One, we can just be so much more confident with our customers as to when their products are going to be there. The route optimization is just incredible and how they route the drivers. For example, one thing it tries to do is take more right turns than left turns. So you can turn right on red as oppose to crossing traffic when you have to turn left. Those little efficiencies add up dramatically and the effect of ultimately probably putting fewer trucks on the road with better service is really going to have an impact on our customer base.","As far as the sales KPIs, Tony, we're looking at total clock time, sitting with our reps, I think \u2013 and coaching, just pure coaching that we're doing and monitoring the outbound calls more effectively. I think the net effect of that is better customer service, you're absolutely right. We'll have better contact with our customers, more time on the phone with our customers and really become that vendor of choice as a result because we'll be so much more responsive to their requests and needs.","So, that's moving full steam ahead. Back to the route optimization I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with 65% rolled out. We expect to have that 100% rolled out by the end of this year. So, I think the combination of the two, where we'll provide better customer service on the phone and then better customer service on the delivery end, really will raise the bar significantly on our customer service levels, so both are equally important.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","And does return rate \u2013 is that ever influenced by either one of these, meaning either the \u2013 it was miscommunicated in terms of which part was actually needed and\/or the part didn't get there in the right amount of time and thus was a return because it ended up coming from somewhere else? Does this \u2013 I don't know if that's a big number or not, but is there an influence there as well?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think the biggest factor on return rate is cars totaling after the estimate's repaired \u2013 an estimate's written and the parts are ordered, or the customer never shows up. They say they're coming in on Tuesday, and they don't bring the car in. I think that's a bigger factor. However, obviously getting the part \u2013 making sure the customer is ordering the right part and our rep is making sure they are writing up the right part is critical. We do expect some improvement in return rates, in terms of getting the right part on the truck. But again, there's so many other factors that affect return rates that I don't think it's going to be a huge diminishment in the return rates.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And if you look at your other businesses, the newer ones with the glass and with Rhiag. Are there any other seasonality effects that we should consider as we go through the balance of this year and into next year or do they pretty much mirror sort of the normal seasonality you have in your existing business?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The Rhiag business is pretty consistent with our other European businesses. It tends to slow down a little bit around the holidays if you will. The glass business, the fourth quarter tends to turn down a little bit as well. Some of the OE is going to shut down around the holidays and the like. And so it's not a perfect spread of 25% a quarter across the year, if you will. So there are some gives and takes.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. On the aftermarket side of the glass, Tony, obviously winter weather is good for them, with salts, and \u2013 causing stone chips and rock chips. So a little bit of seasonality in the winter as well.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Great. Thank you for your time.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Most of mine have been answered. But on the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, you've indicated what you thought the accretion might be in 2017 for a full annualized run rate. Any change to your \u2013 what are you seeing there?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. Nothing, Bill. I mean the increase in our guidance is basically $0.17 a share. That's the exact same $0.17 that collectively we announced when we chatted about those transactions in December and February respectively, again picking up $0.11 from the Rhiag acquisition and $0.06 from the PGW transaction. When you think about how that gets spread for the quarters, obviously, the second quarter is going to have the smallest impact because while we have three months of Rhiag, we only have two months of PGW. So you probably want to think about that as maybe being a nickel of the $0.17.","Then Q3 and Q4 would suggest about $0.06 a piece against \u2013 it may be $0.065 in Q3 and $0.055 in Q4 just because of the seasonality, some of the seasonality that we just talked about. But again, the $0.17 increase in our guidance is exactly consistent with what we've previously announced for the two transactions. And on \u2013 what we saw in Q1 even though they weren't on our ledger, if you will, they're tracking the plan which is good.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for that color.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bill. Devon, I think we have time for one more call.","Operator","Okay. Our next and final question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please proceed with your question.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Thanks for squeezing me in.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, Jason.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","My questions are answered. Did want to ask though, if you could provide an estimate for interest expense for the year? Thanks.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't have that at my fingertips. For the first quarter, our interest cost was running at about 3.8% on a total blended basis with all the fees and everything else. And we've got about $3.4 billion of debt, roughly probably $100 million, when you do that math.","Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review","Thank you very much.","Dominick P.

Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are again delighted with our quarterly and full year results, and before I provide an update on our operations, let me briefly highlight a few key financial metrics from the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015.","Turning to slide three, Q4 revenue reached $1.75 billion, an increase of 3.8% as compared to $1.68 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact to our Other Revenue category, revenue grew 8% for the quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $95.1 million, an increase of 18.1% as compared to $80.5 million for the same period of 2014.","Diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, increased 19.2% from $0.26 for the fourth quarter of 2014, while adjusted EPS increased from $0.27 to $0.32. Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.2% for the quarter, and on a constant currency basis, total growth for parts and services was 10.9%. I am particularly pleased with our EPS performance, given that the effect from FX and weakness in commodity prices, which combined negatively impacted the year-over-year change in EPS by $0.03.","For full-year 2015, revenue reached $7.19 billion, an increase of 6.7% as compared to 2014. For the first time ever, revenue surpassed $7 billion, a major milestone for the company. Net income for the full year was $423.2 million, compared with $381.5 million for the prior, an increase of 10.9%.","Organic revenue growth for parts and services for 2015 was 7%, a solid performance given the tough comp of 9% in 2014. On a constant currency basis, total revenue growth for 2015 was 10.1%, while total revenue growth for parts and services was 14.1%. Our adjusted EPS for all of 2015 was $1.42, representing an increase of 11.8% from the $1.27 reported in 2014, again, net of the adverse impact of FX and commodity pricing.","Now a brief update on our operations, which are highlighted on slides six and seven. During the quarter, our North American operations continued to benefit from various macro trends. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven was up 3.5% in 2015 as compared to 2014. Miles driven in 2015 was the highest number reported since 1990. With low prices and ongoing improvements in the unemployment rate, we do expect a continuation of this trend.","Though initially a headwind, as newer vehicles requiring repair tend to receive new OE parts, the increase in the SAAR rate presents attractive growth prospects for our alternative products as these vehicles age. The SAAR rate for 2015 was 17.4 million units, compared to 16.4 million units for 2014, a 6.1% increase year-over-year. Auto industry analysts expect this trend to continue in 2016, which again should be good for our North American collision businesses as well as our specialty segment. These trends helped drive North American organic growth for parts and services of 5.6% in Q4, despite the mild weather patterns we faced throughout December.","During Q4 and for full-year 2015, we purchased over 73,000 and 288,000 vehicles, respectively, for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is essentially flat year-over-year for both periods. During Q4, our pricing at auction was flat compared to Q4 2014, but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over one year. This younger vehicle procurement strategy continues to perform well and played a role in the improvements we witnessed in Q4 year-over-year in North American gross margins.","For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings, as well as the total member of certified parts available, each growing 13.2% and 32.2% respectively in 2015. In our self-service retail business, during Q4 we acquired over 112,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 4% decrease over Q4 2014.","For full-year 2015, vehicle procurement was approximately 471,000, a decrease of 8.4% from 2014. As mentioned on past calls, this reduction in the self-service procurement was intentional, given the dynamics we faced with the scrap markets throughout the year. Nick will provide more detail on scrap during his comments, and in particular its impact on revenue.","Turning to the 2015 results of our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services, the revenue and number of purchase orders processed through the CCC platform during 2015 each grew 66% respectively year-over-year. Clearly, the trend towards shops adopting this feature within the CCC platform continues to gain traction, with this initiative currently annualizing over $28 million in revenue for LKQ.","And lastly on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in four key areas, with one of them being procurement. During the quarter, AlixPartners led an internal focus group tasked with assessing our current maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, and indirect spend categories, and the details behind what we can change or can consolidate.","Following this extensive analysis, we modified and redefined several positions within our procurement team in attempt to optimize our ability to capture the potential savings uncovered. Though early in the process, we are extremely encouraged by the savings we could achieve in areas of both direct spend on after-market parts and the MRO, and the indirect spend categories such as logistics, corrugated boxes and shipping supplies, vehicle rentals, IT hardware, and various services. While it will take a few quarters for the savings on parts purchases to be realized and rolled through our inventory turns, we anticipate we will begin to realize some of the savings on the other items in late Q1 of this year.","Now moving on to our European operations. In Q4, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth of 6.3% and acquisition growth of 5%, which was offset by a decrease of 6.7% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q4, ECP drove organic revenue growth of 8.9%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 6.8%, solid performance given that the UK witnessed one of the warmest and most mild winters since 1985. During the quarter, ECP opened one additional branch, bringing our UK network to 199, an increase of 110 branches since we acquired ECP. With the continued market opportunities in the UK, I am pleased to announce that we approved an additional 13 branches in 2016.","During Q4, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 21.2%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q4 weather in the UK and a tough 2014 comp.","And lastly on ECP, I'd like to provide a brief update on our new 750,000-square-foot national distribution warehouse, currently under development in the UK. Upon completion of the building shell in early February 2016, we began our lease payments and also started absorbing duplicate expenses that will continue through 2017 as we begin to move towards finalizing the full consolidation of our existing NDCs into this state-of-the-art facility. Nick will cover the impact of those costs shortly.","During Q1, we began installing interior racking in preparation for using the facility for bulk storage in Q2, with the automation and more sophisticated storage spaces scheduled to be completed in 2017. For the quarter and for full year 2015, we did not incur any material costs related to this project.","And now turning to our Sator business. With the network build-up in the Netherlands largely completed via a combination of acquisitions and innovative partnering solutions, Sator has now turned its focus towards integrating the systems in place at the wholesale level. By year-end 2016, we plan to have consolidated from six systems to two, with integrated end-to-end inventory and customer visibility, a key enabler for driving logistical and working capital improvements in the business.","And now to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 16.2% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 8.1%. During the quarter, all integration activities from the Coast acquisition continued as planned. In total, our Specialty team integrated 5 of the 17 Coast warehouses into our existing KAO distribution centers, with two additional warehouses integrated in January.","In addition, during Q4, our Specialty team stocked the 360,000-square-foot warehouse in Michigan, mentioned on the previous call, and in January we officially began shipping product from this facility. I am also pleased to announce that in 2015, the Specialty team achieved two significant milestones. For the first time, Specialty eclipsed $1 billion in annual revenue and made over 1 million delivery stops. Congratulations to our Specialty team for reaching such an impressive milestone.","Now on to corporate development. In December 2015, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, for an enterprise value of \u20ac1.04 billion. This acquisition gives us access to the rapidly growing Eastern European market, and of course Italy, where Rhiag's base business is well positioned for continued growth beyond their current 15% market share. The targeted closing for Rhiag is progressing as expected, with all the filings required by the EU and Ukraine regulatory authorities submitted, accepted and deemed complete. Those regulatory agencies are now in the final review process, and we anticipate this deal to close in the first half of 2016.","In addition to the Rhiag announcement, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we acquired a wholesale salvage business in Sweden and an interest in a pan-European distributor and remanufacturer of engines and powertrain products. Lastly, earlier this month the company sold its interest in ACM Parts, our JV in Australia, to our JV partner Suncorp. LKQ played a pivotal role in the creation of ACM Parts, and we will continue to have a strong working relationship with the business. Key formal strategic alliances between ACM Parts and LKQ, particularly those related to aftermarket parts sourcing and technology, will remain in place. This transaction allows us to maintain a presence in Australia while redeploying our capital, both human and financial, towards the multiple opportunities we have in Europe.","Clearly, 2015 was another very active year, with our development efforts resulting in the completion of 18 acquisitions, which combined, expanded our geographic footprint and extended our leadership position in each of our operating segments.","At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our 2016 guidance.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of the three segments, before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our guidance for 2016.","For those of you who accessed our earnings presentation on the website, you will notice that we have included detail on both the fourth quarter ended December 31 as well as the full year of 2015. My comments will generally follow the flow of the presentation, but as usual, I will primarily focus on the quarterly results.","The short version of our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2015 would be a repeat of the third quarter. Save for our self-service operation, we had a great quarter in which we experienced solid revenue and earnings growth despite the continued headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar.","As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.75 billion, representing a 3.8% increase over last year. That reflects an 8% increase in revenue from parts and services, offset in part by a 38% decline in other revenue, primarily related to the continued decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals, which I will address in a few minutes.","The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.2% growth from organic activities, plus 4.7% from acquisitions, equated to constant-currency growth of 10.9%, before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 2.9% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results.","As noted on slide 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 40 basis points to 39.9% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 50-basis-point improvement from operations, offset by a 10-basis-point decline due to revenue mix, as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, outpaced that of our other operations.","We lost about 20 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, again largely due to our self-service operations. Those operations continued to experience a meaningful decline in revenue related to the lower scrap steel prices and an uptick in expenses, the combination of which resulted in materially higher cost as a percent of revenue in each expense category. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution cost as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expense benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation.","Segment EBITDA totaled $193 million for the quarter, reflecting a 5.7% increase from 2014. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.0%, a 20-basis-point improvement over the 10.8% recorded last year.","The increase in EBITDA, when combined with lower relative levels of depreciation and amortization and interest expense, allowed pre-tax income to increase by 7.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year, and pre-tax margins expanded by 30 basis points to 8.0% from 7.7%.","Our net tax rate during the fourth quarter was 30.4%, down from 37.3% in 2014. The tax rate reflects an effective rate of 34.55% for the quarter, as well as a favorable adjustment to get us to that level on a year-to-date basis, as we have been accruing at an effective rate of 34.75% through the first three quarters.","The 2015 annual rate reflects a favorable shift due to a relative increase in earnings sourced from the UK, which has a low tax rate. We also benefited from a few discrete items during the quarter, including a couple of deferred tax adjustments due to favorable state or foreign tax rate changes, a couple of refunds, and some FIN 48 reserve releases due to settlements or statute expirations.","As Rob mentioned, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.26 last year, a 19% increase, and adjusted earnings per share before restructuring charges was $0.32 a share versus $0.27, again reflecting a 19% improvement. A solid fourth quarter brought our adjusted EPS for the year to $1.42 which is exactly the midpoint of our guidance provided in February of 2015, notwithstanding the fact that the plunge in scrap prices had a $0.07 negative impact and the strong dollar had a $0.04 negative impact on our year-over-year EPS growth during 2015.","As mentioned in December, starting in 2016 we are changing the definition of adjusted EPS to exclude the after-tax impact of intangible amortization. As highlighted in Appendix 4 on page 32 of the slide deck, 2015 adjusted EPS under the new definition is $1.49 a share.","As highlighted on slide 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins, and that will become more accentuated once we close the pending Rhiag acquisition and we begin to consolidate the Rhiag results.","And with that, let's get into the details on the segments.","Revenue in our North American segment during the fourth quarter in 2015 increased to $1.018 billion, or almost 1% over 2014. This is the combination of a 7.9% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 39% decline in other revenue, again the latter which was due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. Importantly, organic growth in North American parts and services was 5.6%. All in all, this was a very solid quarter.","Margins in North America during the fourth quarter increased 90 basis points relative to the comparable period of the prior year, to 43.2% from 42.3%. This increase was primarily due to our improved pricing to customers in our aftermarket operations, improved procurement in our salvage operations, and a mix shift away from self-service, which has lower gross margins than our wholesale operations.","With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost approximately 90 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2014. On the upside, we continued to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year, as diesel fuel averaged $2.43 a gallon compared to $3.58 a gallon. As a percent of revenue, fuel costs declined by 40 basis points, while we experienced some modest increases in facility and SG expenses in our wholesale business.","Unfortunately, our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses, but meaningfully lower revenue due both to the significant decline in scrap prices and a modest reduction in the number of cars processed. As a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis.","Slide 16 takes a closer look at scrap steel prices over the past 24 months. You will note that the average price we realized in Q4 of 2015 was approximately $82 a ton, down 56% compared to the average of $187 a ton realized in Q4 of last year. In total, the lower pricing for scrap steel reduced our revenue for the quarter by approximately $26 million on a year-over-year basis. The decline in scrap steel prices had approximately a $0.03 negative impact on our EPS during the quarter. Scrap steel prices have leveled out the last few months, and hopefully we will not see continued deterioration.","While we have been dealing with falling scrap prices for a while, during Q4 we also experienced a continued material decline in the prices received for other metals that are a residual of our recycling activities, including aluminum, copper, platinum, palladium and rhodium, which were down between 20% and 45% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. So while revenue from scrap steel was down $30 million during the quarter, revenue derived from selling these other precious metals and catalytic converters, excuse me, was down an incremental $16 million compared to Q4 of last year. So in total, the falling metals prices depressed our North American business by approximately 160 basis points during Q4 of 2015 relative to the margins in the prior year.","In total, for the North American business during the fourth quarter of 2015, the total EBITDA was $131 million, reflecting a 1.3% increase compared to last year. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for North America was 12.8%, flat with the comparable period of the prior year. In both dollar and percentage terms, the wholesale operations improved relative to the comparable period, with EBITDA margins being up 70 basis points, but the overall segment results were flat as a result of the decline at our self-service operations.","Moving onto our European segment. Total revenue in the fourth quarter accelerated to $487 million from $465 million. Organic growth in Europe during the quarter was 6.3%, reflecting the combination of 8.9% growth at ECP and just under 1% at Sator. The impact of acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 5% increase in revenue, so on a constant currency basis, European revenue was up 11.3%.","These gains were offset by a 6.7% decline due to the translation impact with the strong dollar, creating a negative impact on revenue and resulting in total growth for Europe of 4.6%. Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.9%, which was a 160-basis-point improvement over the comparable period of 2014.","Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations, as we continued to benefit from improved procurement in the UK and the internalization of the gross margins from acquisitions in the Netherlands. These are the highest quarterly gross margins we have achieved in Europe since early 2012.","With respect to operating expenses in Europe, we loss about 40 basis points, due largely to higher SG&A expense at our UK operation, reflecting higher personnel cost to support the growth of the business, including our e-commerce development.","European EBITDA totaled $47.4 million, which was a 23.6% increase, even after taking into account the impact of the strong dollar, which had a negative effect of about $3 million. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 9.7% versus 8.2% last year, reflecting a 150-basis-point improvement.","As noted on slide 19, relative to the fourth quarter of 2014, the pound declined 4% and the euro declined 13% against the dollar. We estimate that for the fourth quarter, the strong dollar reduced European revenue by approximately $31 million compared to Q4 of last year, and removing the impact of the currency swings would have resulted in Q4 revenue growth of 11.3%. Given the significant margin improvement, constant currency EBITDA growth was 32%, which we believe is quite strong. When taking all currencies into account, the strong dollar reduced Q4 year-over-year EPS growth by a fraction of $0.01 compared to last year.","Turning to our Specialty segment, revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $245 million, a 16% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. Obviously the impact of the acquisition of Coast Distribution in August of 2015 accounted for the largest component of growth at 9.5%, but the organic growth rate of 8.1% was also quite strong. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the fourth quarter declined by 280 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of the Coast acquisition.","On the bright side, operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down by about 150 basis points as we continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing distribution network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $15 million, essentially flat with 2014, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment decreased by 120 basis points to 6.1%.","This is a highly seasonal business and the fourth quarter is by far the weakest, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower right-hand corner of slide 20. As highlighted during the third quarter call, we fully anticipated the Coast acquisition with its focus on the RV marketplace would accentuate the normal drop in fourth quarter margins, and it did.","Now, let's move on to capital allocation, which given working capital swings, the lumpiness of capital spending, and the timing of acquisitions is best viewed on a full-year basis, as presented on slide 22. You will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations for 2015 was approximately $530 million as we experienced a strong increase in earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital.","In 2015, we deployed $330 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $170 million to fund capital expenditures and $160 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. So for 2015, we generated $200 million of free cash flow, and we used all of that and some excess cash to repay $224 million of our debt. We closed the quarter with approximately $87 million of cash, of which about $59 million was held outside of the United States.","At December 31, we had $1.6 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected a leverage ratio of approximately 1.7 times as defined by our credit agreement. As announced earlier this month, we completed an amendment to our credit facility, increasing the total capacity by $900 million to a total of $3.2 billion, and extending the maturity to January of 2021. Today, our total availability under the new facility is approximately $2.2 billion, which is more than sufficient to fund the acquisition of Rhiag and support the continued growth of our businesses.","Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided some guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Please note that our guidance excludes any impact from the proposed Rhiag acquisition, which we hope to close in the second quarter. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we ended up at 7% for 2015 and have set the full-year range for 2016 at 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience.","Our range for adjusted EPS, which now excludes the impact of intangible amortization, is $1.59 to $1.69 a share, with a midpoint of $1.64. Assumed in that estimate is approximately $19 million of after-tax amortization, or about $0.06 per share. Said another way, based on the former reporting definition, the midpoint of adjusted EPS would be $1.58, which is consistent with the current analyst estimates for 2016.","Going forward, I would ask that all the analysts adapt to the new adjusted EPS format so we have consistency in the EPS estimates. To assist with some of the year-over-year comparisons, appendices four and five of the callback include a reconciliation to the new adjusted format on an annual basis from 2015 to \u2013 from 2011 to 2015, and on a quarterly basis for the four quarters of 2015.","The EPS guidance all assumes that the pound sterling, euro and Canadian dollar remain at budgeted levels of $1.45, $1.10 and $0.70, respectively, and importantly that scrap remains at current levels as well. On a year-over-year basis, I would note that the lower exchange rates have a $0.03 per share negative impact on earnings, and consistent with what we presented in the second quarter callback in July, the new Tamworth distribution facility will have another $0.03 negative impact during 2016. So that's a combined headwind of $0.06 a share compared to 2015, and at the midpoint of the guidance we are still expecting a 10% year-over-year improvement.","The corresponding adjusted net income guidance is from $490 million to $520 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 is 34.7%, reflecting the slightly lower relative earnings contribution coming from the low-tax-rate United Kingdom, and the impact of the new distribution facility in Tamworth will slow the earnings growth from that country.","Our guidance from cash flow from operations is approximately $520 million to $550 million with a midpoint of $535 million, a small increase over 2015 reflecting continued growth in cash earnings, offset by a more meaningful investment in working capital during 2016 compared to 2015. And finally, we set the guidance for capital spending at $170 million to $180 million, up just a bit over 2015.","At this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nick. To summarize, we faced some challenging headwinds this year with scrap and currency, two dynamics that are outside of our control, yet despite these challenges we delivered solid results for 2015.","Now looking ahead. Since the 2008 recession in North America, we have witnessed an increased level of road congestion, which undoubtedly has played a role in the number of the paid claims increasing every year since 2009. Also, the number of vehicles in the U.S. continues to rise, with 264 million registered vehicles on the road at the end of 2015, a year when we witnessed the highest growth rate since 1999.","These trends, coupled with the recent upswing in miles driven and lower gas prices, should continue to provide a nice tailwind to our collision business.","In the UK, the miles traveled on all roads and classes and the number of vehicles licensed reached their highest levels on record in 2015, trends that should continue to benefit our branch network across the UK. At Sator, we have largely completed our three-step-to-two-step transformation and are now prepared to move the business forward as a single business operating unit. In addition, with the pending acquisition of Rhiag, our European strategy continues to evolve, and once closed, Rhiag will solidify our market-leading position across all of Europe. Yet, we have more runway to grow this fragmented market.","Also, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our Specialty segment and the timing of our entry into this large and highly fragmented market. The project \u2013 the projected trend \u2013 upward trend in the SAAR rate should continue to benefit this segment.","In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication that our 31,000-plus employees delivered for the company, our stockholders, and most importantly our customers in 2015. I am equally proud of our team's commitment on delivering continued and consistent performance, as reflected in our 2016 guidance. To further that point, over the last 16 years the LKQ team has delivered, on average, 7.5% organic growth, an accomplishment that few can claim, yet one that we have delivered predictably and consistently each and every year.","Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey, thank you, good morning.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Tony.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","The first question I had stems from the EBITDA and the margin. In the U.S. it's holding steady, some of the margins that you talked about today were actually better than would have expected. And I'm just wondering how that margin improvement will translate in Europe, and is this a situation where you will be able to close the gap, knowing that they're two totally different businesses? But yet there are some efficiencies that have yet to been extracted?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Tony, this is Nick. Good morning.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Obviously, the North American margins are a little bit of a tale of two cities, right? With the increase in EBITDA margins and the wholesale business I mentioned on the call, about 70 basis points, against a drop in the self-service margins. The margins in Europe hit double digits for the year. There are a lot of folks who 12 months ago were wondering how many years it was going to take us to get to double-digit margins in Europe, and we're at 10.1% for the year, so we are very proud of that.","You know, we do think that ultimately the margins in Europe will have the ability to trend north, though I would caution folks that actually in 2016, because of the Tamworth facility, I quantify that as $0.03 a share. The reality from a margin perspective, if you take the \u2013 the roughly $13 million of P&L hit due to Tamworth, and you lay that against our 2015 results coming out of Europe, we would lose about 65 basis points to 70 basis points of margin just because of that facility.","So, taking that aside, we think we can get some improvement in margins in Europe in the coming years, as we continue to rationalize. We think that once the Rhiag transaction is rolled in, that will give us incremental opportunities to get some savings on procurement, some savings on cataloging, some savings on the e-commerce platform, private labeling, all the things that John is hard at work on over in Europe.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","That's helpful. And then, I wanted to talk a little bit about the strategy to continue to get, I guess, later model buying at the auctions. Bigger picture, and if you look at the touch points for repair on today's vehicles, are there \u2013 are these later model vehicles actually providing you with more opportunities to sell an LKQ part?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely, Tony. And the other important part to note is, these are higher-priced parts. We like to give an example of the F150, the 2015, the taillight has blind spot detection, it's an $800 taillight, and the 2014 taillight was $85, it was just a piece of plastic. So these later model cars will give us some upside on pricing as well as just availability as they work through the SAAR rate. We think that with a strong SAAR rate for the last couple of the years, once they start hitting that sweet spot, that's going to provide a nice tailwind, and we're about six months to a year away from those really starting to hit in mass.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then just my last question with Rhiag. You talked about, I guess the second quarter, is there any thought on terms of the accretion that it may have now, based on the timeline of the close? I think originally you had said somewhere in the neighborhood of a $0.11, if I am not mistaken?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. That's still our best thinking Tony, $0.11 a share on our new adjusted EPS basis, so you would layer that on top of the midpoint of the $1.64 that we just referenced.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tony, we are absolutely on pace to close at when we thought we would, early Q2. So we're very well along that way, the path, with the authorities over Europe.","Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Great. Thanks for your time.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. Just to follow up on what Tony had to say there, is the $0.11 the, excuse me, the annual impact, or would that be the impact as if you owned it for six months?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That is a partial year, Craig, it's not the annual impact. You notice that in 2017, the EPS accretion that we gave folks back in December is $0.21 a share.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. That's \u2013 that is helpful to clarify that. And then, with respect to your European operational priorities, I think you addressed it a little bit, Nick, in your prior response, but could you add a little more color as far as how we should evaluate your progress in Europe in terms of the goals you've set operationally?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Craig, this is Rob. As Nick mentioned, John is hard at work and obviously we're very pleased with the double-digit EBITDA that we put up this year. The priorities would be \u2013 with Rhiag coming on board is to get that integrated into the system, and on purchasing, the e-commerce as Nick mentioned. So we've got some work to do there.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Sator is basically done from the three-step-to-two-step conversion. So we are anticipating getting back to normal there, and I also mentioned we're going from six systems to two systems. So the work at Sator is to finish that, get the systems on one play, get the Rhiag integrated, and of course the UK still opening branches, et cetera, and we're working that game plan.","The other thing I'd like to add, as I mentioned in my notes, we did take a JV interest in a remanufacturer in Europe. We're going to end \u2013 start bringing those products into our different operations. So that's another opportunity as well. So those are the major priorities over in Europe this year.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Rob. And then finally, you have this Tamworth distribution center, which is exciting as it rolls out. Should this be considered a model for what you plan to do in Europe once you've got most of your footprint laid out?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think it's fair to say we will combine major warehouses where we can. The Tamworth 2 facility is 750,000 square feet and semi-automated, that would be the plan going forward as we build out the network in Europe, is to put a massive DC with semi-automation as well. So assuming this one goes well, and right so far, it's on plan to budget and to the timeliness. We are very excited about getting that online because I think it's going to make us much more efficient.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So, that's dilutive early in the process, but obviously accretive down the road. But when we think about that accretion down the road, should we also have in the back of our mind that you may add additional DCs that could be, again short term dilutive, long term very accretive?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's fair. As we continue to work on Europe and the opportunity presents itself, we would likely put another DC into somewhere in Europe.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Thank you so much.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C","Good morning, everyone.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Nate.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C","So, Rob, thanks for some additional color on the AlixPartners kind of consulting project, in terms of where you're going with that. I was kind of curious a little bit in terms of just, if you look back a year ago when you started with that, in terms of like the progression and uncovering additional opportunities, relative to your additional \u2013 or your original expectations? And then, the second part of that is, how much of that improvement are you guys kind of including in your guidance, and whether there could be more upside as you uncover more opportunities?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I'll let Nick answer the guidance, but let me talk first about the \u2013 what we've found so far. We're very pleased with the work completed. I mentioned on the call \u2013 on my prepared remarks about the purchasing, but we're also seeing equal progress in our sales initiative, as well as our routing software. So the fourth leg of that, of course, was the efficiencies at our dismantling. Just to give an update on that, we have hired a Six Sigma Black Belt that's working on that project as well.","So, these will take time to work through the system, but we are in the process of consolidating our sales centers into call centers, regional call centers. And then on the routing software, rolling out every one of our trucks, we'll know exactly where that truck is, we'll be able to be much more customer-focused on their timeless of delivery, and then also taking out cost on that, because we'll be able to be more efficient in the routing. As far as the guidance, Nick?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And Nate, obviously the benefit that we gain from procurement pricing in the aftermarket parts marketplace, it takes time to get those POs in place. We have most of the adjusted pricing locked down with our vendors, but now we have to start placing orders, the product needs to get shipped over the ocean, delivered to our warehouses, and then we have to turn it through the inventory. So you're not going to see a whole lot of impact there in 2016. On some of the other items, we do believe we will be begin to get some flow-through late Q1, early Q2. As far as our guidance, is there a meaningful impact there? No. The biggest proportion will come from the aftermarket procurement.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C","And then just bigger picture, along with that, to Rob is like philosophically, obviously, it's always been about putting the pedal down on terms of growth, and obviously that's still priority number one in a lot of potential acquisitions, particularly over in Europe and still more to go in North America. But obviously, particularly with that project, as well as the procurement initiatives in Europe, there's a little bit now of a focus in terms of getting efficiency improvements and generating the more consistent margins and hopefully more consistent cash flow. How do you philosophically think about that now, in terms of running the organization?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it's making us much more efficient, Nate. We had, through the years, operated really decentralized, and I think getting consistencies on our sales process and how we measure our sales reps across the country and across the world, quite frankly, is going to make us much more efficient. And I think, though we'll get maybe some head count efficiencies, but also just being able to track our people on metrics that we think are key to driving the business. So it's an important initiative within our company.","And as far as the routing software goes, that's equally important, being able to give our customers better service, and that will definitely be a result of this routing software. It's an amazing software that allows us to track the truck down to the mile and where it is and its ability to get to a customer. So we're going to be much more interactive with our customer base, which we think is a big advantage.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C","Okay. And then just one last quick question regarding ECP. Obviously, getting a little bit more mature over there in terms of the branch build-out and whatnot. What do you see as the biggest growth opportunity now over the next three years for ECP? Is it still blocking and tackling in terms of market share gains, or is it about the new product injections or a combination of everything?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a combination of everything. There are absolutely market share gains that we're continuing to get there, and we will to continue to get that we think. Adding the paint, adding the re-man engines now into the marketplace, and we'll have calipers and transmissions as well. We think that's really the big opportunity there. Of course, the Tamworth 2 is going to be absolutely critical to really outpacing our competitors and being able to get the product to them much more quicker. So we think we're going to get a big competitive advantage when we get T2 online. Tamworth 2.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C","Great. Thanks for the time.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nate.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Kelley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. This is David in for Bret Jordan. How are you?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good, David. How are you?","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","I'm doing well, thanks. Just a couple quick ones. Could you maybe provide some color on the ongoing MSO consolidation trend in the market, and maybe the impact you're seeing on alternative parts utilization at the moment?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. The MSO consolidation is continuing, it's \u2013 there are several very active buyers of body shops. We believe that's a positive for us. These MSOs are very tied to the insurance industry in driving alternative parts, so we are very pleased with that, and that \u2013 I don't see that slowing down any time soon, David. They are very aggressive in consolidating. I did just see a recent report that there're still 40,000 body shops in the United States, so there are still a tremendous amount of independents, but the consolidation will continue.","As far as AP usage goes, we haven't seen the 2015 number yet from CCC, but we expect it to be relatively flat again at 36% mainly as a result of the SAAR rate. These news cars are demanding new parts. As I said earlier, we do think that's a benefit, as these tend to be higher-priced parts. But what we have seen, interestingly enough, is the number of parts per estimate continues to grow. In 2015 it went up to 9.2 parts per estimate, which is a huge trend in our favor. Obviously as cars get in accidents, we like to see parts get replaced versus repaired so that we can sell a product.","So we see that trend continuing for two reasons. One, the complexity of the cars \u2013 the aluminum car is coming; I know we see magnesium is being entered into the parts stream as well. These will get replaced more often than repaired, that's a positive. And then the complexity \u2013 the body shop industry tends to be focusing more on replacing than repairing, so all positive trends, and we think, when these SAAR rates start to get into the sweet spot, we'll see that alternative part usage go from 36% to even higher as the parts make their way into the system.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","All right. Great; very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up here. You mention your price paid at auction I believe was flat year-over-year, but the average age of the vehicle purchased was a year or so younger. Do you have maybe a comparable same-age change in price? We were just hoping to get a feeling for ASPs, given some of the recent FX and scrap movements we're seeing in the market here.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I can tell you on the self-service, the lower end car, our purchase price is down $51 sequentially, so that's where you are going to see the scrap impact. Manheim (54:07) has been stubbornly high still, at 124.7 was the last number we saw. I did listen to the Car Call and I heard them say they were expecting used car prices to soften 3% to 5% this year, so we do expect some relief there, but the new car that we are buying is critical to our strategy, because as the SAAR rate gets through, we are going to see more demand on that new car. So, the fact that the prices are flat and we are buying a newer car, we do know that's obviously a positive for us.","David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC","All right. Perfect. I appreciate the color, and thanks for taking my question.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","So if I could just talk about weather quickly, you mentioned warmer winter weather. Obviously that was a headline in the automotive space in the fourth quarter. Presumably that potentially diminishes the demand for collision products in the period, but if I recall in 2014 \u2013 excuse me; in 2015, there was a backlog in a number of the repair shops as a result of the pretty severe winter weather outlook for the fourth quarter. Could you talk about maybe the puts and takes there, across 4Q and 1Q, and sort of how we should think about that landscape in the current environment?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me talk about how the quarter is looking thus far. January was on plan, and thus far through February, we are also on plan as well, and we're up against some really tough comps in New England. As you remember, last year they had a blizzard it seemed like every other week for January and February, so there was some backlog.","Just to put some color on the winter in Q4, ECP in December, their battery sales for one month were off 30%; that was $2.5 million difference just in battery sales. So the mild winter wasn't just here, it was also in Europe, so little bit of impact obviously in Q4. But so far through Q1, we are on plan and we're pretty happy. Now, there were some horrendous storms that came through the Southeast yesterday. Obviously those take time to get through the system, we'll see what that does. But so far, we are pretty pleased considering the comps we were up against in 2014.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Great. And then maybe dovetailing on your ECP commentary, the two-year stack on a same-store sales basis accelerated nicely despite that warm winter weather. You talked about market share gains. Could you disaggregate for us, of the 6.8%, what was secular growth, what was market share gains, and sort of what your expectation in there going forward?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That's really hard for us to get our arms around because so many of our branches over there, Ben, are relatively close together, and we're consolidating some branches and the like. We think that the majority is related to market share gains, as we continue to expand out throughout the country. But there's, every time we open up a little branch, there's a little bit of cannibalization of the branches around it. So it's really hard to disaggregate that the way you want it.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Sure.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's fair to say, though, Ben, that the industry is growing circa GDP, so it feels like most of it's market share gains.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Okay; great. And then just one last one for me, sticking with Europe, the collision business, obviously is a big opportunity longer term. Any updates there, and sort of some of the things that you are working through to build that business?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. The \u2013 now that we've got the Sator business done, up basically from a three-step to a two-step, our plan is to launch that in probably Q3 or Q4 of 2016. One update on the UK: we did add one more insurance company into the program. So we are now up to 9 of the top 10 insurer company. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it was still well over 20% growth, so still strong double-digit. We are very pleased with that, and we are excited about bringing that to the continent. I think Rhiag also provides an opportunity there as well, in the Eastern European countries, so we are excited about that opportunity and I expect to see something here in the tail half of 2016.","Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.","Very good. Good luck, guys. Thanks.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of James Albertine with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Good morning and thanks for taking my question, gentlemen.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Jamie.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I can speak wholeheartedly to that storm yesterday in Washington. If you do some water removal in basements, let me know. Real quickly, on the guidance, you mentioned FX and you also mentioned some headwind from Tamworth. I didn't hear any mention of scrap in the guidance. Maybe I missed it. But what should we be considering, assuming there is continued pressure as there has been sequentially now for several quarters?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So if scrap prices, particularly scrap steel prices, stay where they are, there should be maybe $0.01 or so, maybe $0.02 at the most in Q1, but by then most of the \u2013 this $80 scrap price will have rolled off, and we'd be in the clear. So we are not anticipating a big headwind from scrap, but again, that all assumes that prices stay where they are and they don't fall.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. And I wanted to ask as well on the Rhiag side, and going back in the, sort of \u2013 I appreciate the appendices, and apologies for having sort of a confused initial look earlier this morning on the guidance side. But with respect to one element of Rhiag you had talked about in December, refinancing opportunity there. Is that considered in your $0.11 for the balance of this year, or is that something that would be incremental theoretically to the $0.11 guide?","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, that's included. We assumed that we would take out the 7.25% fixed-rate notes very quickly after \u2013 at closing, and that is our full intent. Part of the reason we increased the line of credit was to give us the flexibility to do that. Now, we will come back and \u2013 at some time during 2016, depending on how the euro markets are, is replace out with our own bond, which will be at a \u2013 obviously it will be a fixed-rate instrument at a higher rate than under our line of credit, but we fully anticipated in the $0.11 accretion in 2016 that we would be taking out all the existing Rhiag debt.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And if I may just ask one more, I know it's getting late in the call and I appreciate you taking the question. On the working capital side, just there seems to be quite a bit of sort of change that you are unearthing, both you're working on things with AlixPartners on procurement, and obviously you're bringing Rhiag on here potentially, and then some of the three-to-two-step transitions. But how should we think about sort of the big swings in working capital? What should we watch for as it relates to upside-downside to your \u2013 to the cash flow from ops guidance? Thanks.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, if you look at the funds flow statement, Jamie, 2015, a little bit unusual. As we told you going back a year, we had built inventories in Q4 of 2014 in anticipation of a potential port strike on the West Coast. And so as you \u2013 we came into the year kind of flush with inventory, and so we didn't need to add as much during the year to support the growth of the business. There was $83 million expansion in inventory during the year. Accounts receivable actually went down in 2015. That is very unusual, given a company that's growing its revenues. A lot of that had to do with some new things we were doing, particularly in the Netherlands, at Sator, some new focus on their receivables processing, if you will. We do not anticipate we will get another downtick in accounts receivable. We actually think receivables are going to grow in 2015 as our revenues grow. And so, that's the biggest swing.","I know each year there seems to be something unusual. When you look at the \u2013 if you go back and you look historically at the kind of cash flow from operations, we were at $206 million in 2012, $428 million in 2013, down to $371 million in 2014, up to $521 million in 2015; most all of that has to do with swings related to working capital, and what I would suggest, if you kind of trend-lined it and normalized that to take out the peaks and the valleys, that's what you should be thinking about on a kind of long-term basis, recognizing that in any given year things could move up or down a little bit.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's incredibly helpful, I appreciate that. And on the inventory \u2013 I mean, just a follow up to that, the inventory, you're buying some newer vehicles at a little higher price point, but you're buying fewer vehicles. Is that sort of going to net out, as we think about sort of inventory swings? And granted, you are working on improved terms and some other items that you noted with the AlixPartners work.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So the item that you referenced, which is the procurement of cars and newer cars and the like, that only impacts our North American salvage business. Actually, most of the inventory is on the aftermarket business here in the U.S., the Specialty business in the U.S., and the whole entirety of the European business, right? Because that's all aftermarket products. So while there will be a little bit of an impact from the salvage operations, that's a minority of our overall inventory balances.","Jamie Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. I appreciate the clarification, and best of luck. Thanks, guys.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",".","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with C.L. King & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen. I want to just ask about Europe. Can you remind us what the average age of the car park is there? How that's trending, and how that might impact demand for your aftermarket parts?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's about 8.7, Bill, is the average age, but it is growing, like the U.S. So we do expect that to be a nice tailwind for our European car parts business. As old cars get older, sort of what they're seeing here in United States, you'll see more need for those mechanical parts. So, definite positive trend.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And one other sort of futuristic question, I guess, and that's driverless cars, collision-avoidance technologies. There are some out there to think that's going to be \u2013 eliminate accidents. How do you guys see that, playing out in terms of how that might impact your business over the next \u2013 both over the near term, and then maybe over the next five years to 10 years?","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's still very early days on that, and from what we've \u2013 the research we've looked at, Bill, most of this is currently an option right now, it's not a standard part. And it's mainly on higher end vehicles, although they are starting to work their way down. There was actually a study done by Thatcham over in UK that suggests that they believe claims volume will not drop precipitously, but severity will, and they actually expect total losses to drop, but the number of claims will. So instead of that violent roll-over collision, there will still be a collision but it just won't be as severe. So they're actually predicting pretty stability.","So I think it's fair to say that it's still early days, but I will say this, it is actually part of our strategy to diversify the business. We do think it's coming, but we \u2013 and everything we've read says it's a decade-out problem, at the earliest. So we're going to continue to diversify the business, look to get away a little bit from the collision, as we've been doing over the last couple of years, but we do think there's at least a solid 10 years left of collisions that are going to stay pretty normalized.","William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Got it. That makes sense. Thanks very much.","Robert L. Wagman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Bill.","Dominick P. Zarcone - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'd like to now turn the floor back over to Mr. Wagman for closing comments.","Robert L.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased with the results we reported this morning. Diluted earnings per share of $0.24 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2013, increased 33% from $0.18 for the third quarter of 2012.","As noted in the press release, the third quarter of 2013 and 2012 diluted earnings per share figures both included losses totaling $0.01 per share resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses and the change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusting for these items in the quarter, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.25, which represents growth of 32% over the prior-year quarter.","Revenue for the quarter was a record $1.3 billion, an increase of 27.7% as compared to $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2012. Net income for the third quarter of 2013 was $73 million, an increase of 36% as compared to $54 million for the same period of 2012.","During the third quarter of 2013, the company delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 11.7%. I am particularly pleased with our North American organic revenue growth for parts and services, which increased 6.2% despite facing unseasonably mild summer temperatures and lower-than-average storm activity in the quarter.","Now for more detail on our North American operations. During the third quarter, we purchased approximately 69,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 15% increase over Q3 2012. The volume at the auctions is robust and the outlook for supply remains steady. We continue to be pleased with the pricing dynamics we are witnessing at auction despite the recent movement in the Manheim Index.","During Q3, vehicle cost was down over 4% year-over-year. With inventory already on hand and a continuation of our current run rate for acquiring cars, we should be well positioned as we approach year end and the start of 2014.","In our heavy-duty truck operations, during the third quarter we purchased approximately 1,800 units for parts as compared to nearly 1,700 in Q3 2012 or a 6% increase.","In our self-service retail business, during the third quarter we acquired over 128,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars as compared to nearly 106,000 in Q3 of 2012 or a 21% increase.","Lastly on North America, during the quarter, we continued to make significant progress with the intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services. CCC ONE's total repair platform is now available to approximately 2,000 users of the CCC ONE Control, Optimize and Innovate product packages, up from 600 users in Q2. Though off of a small base, the revenue and number of purchase orders processed through the CCC platform both grew over 200% during the quarter.","Now turning to our European operations. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to capture market share. In Q3, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 32.9%, and for branches open more than 12 months the organic growth rate was 24%.","As mentioned on prior calls, we approved 15 additional ECP branches to be opened in the third and fourth quarter of 2013. And today, we are on track to hit that target. Through October, we have opened 6 new branches, with the remaining 9 branches scheduled to be opened by year end.","Now for an update on ECP's collisions program. During the quarter, we again witnessed strong, double-digit, year-over-year growth of over 80% with our collision parts sales at ECP. I am also pleased with the growth in our collision parts offerings, which today now stands at over 14,000 SKUs, which represents an increase of 22% year-over-year. Also, we are proud to report that we have finalized an agreement to supply collision parts to a second U.K. carrier in our pilot program. This particular agreement is with a top-10 carrier. Under the terms of the agreement, we are the sole supplier of alternative collision parts to the 16 of their carrier-owned shops located throughout the U.K. Given that we are bound by an NDA, we cannot disclose the carrier's name or any specific details of the agreement at this time.","To further our commitment to expanding Euro Car Parts' collision parts business, the company announced on August 6, 2013, that it acquired 5 paint distributors with a total of 26 locations throughout the United Kingdom. The acquired distributors include Bee Bee Refinishing Supplies Halstead, JCA Coatings, Milton Keynes Paint & Equipment, Premier Paints and finally, Sinemaster Motor Factors. We believe that, with the addition of paint and an extended range of consumables for the Euro Car Parts' product portfolio, we have taken another important step toward becoming the leading one-stop-shop supplier to the collision repair industry in the U.K. market.","These 5 companies provide us with coverage to most of the U.K. market. We believe we are the only nonmanufacturer with a national distribution capability in the U.K. These acquisitions should help further our growing relationship with both insurers and body-shop repairers in the U.K.","Lastly, on our European operations, I am pleased with the initial round of purchasing synergies we are witnessing at Sator. Though still in the early stages, I am confident that we are on target to reach the metrics we indicated when we announced the acquisition.","Now moving on to development projects and other acquisitions. On August 20, 2013, the company announced that it had formed a joint venture with Suncorp Group to develop an alternative auto parts business in Australia. Measured by premiums, Suncorp Group is Australia's largest insurer. With this joint venture, we plan to develop at least one wholesale salvage yard, one aftermarket parts distribution business and one self-service salvage yard in or near each of the Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney markets over the next 4 years.","As part of that agreement, LKQ will supply aftermarket parts to the joint venture, in addition to contributing our experience and expertise to help establish automotive parts recycling operations. Suncorp will supply salvage vehicles to the joint venture and help establish relationships with repair shops as customers. Suncorp acquires approximately 60,000 salvage vehicles from its policyholders annually, and approximately 37,000 of those salvage vehicles are acquired within 100 miles of the locations we intend to open. Within these markets, Suncorp currently has 25 of their own repair shops and an extensive list of preferred regional repairers. These dynamics can provide -- combine to provide the joint venture with an immediate and cost-effective source of salvage supply and instant body-shop demand on day 1 of operations.","With over 12 million passenger vehicles on the road in Australia and a low usage of alternative parts in the market, we believe that this joint venture model presents potential long-term opportunities for our shareholders not only in Australia but other markets, as well.","In addition to our U.K. distributors acquisition and the Australian joint venture, during Q3 we acquired 2 additional companies: A specialty automotive parts distributor in the Benelux and a salvage operation in Arizona. I am pleased with the strength of our acquisition pipeline and the opportunities that continues to present across all lines of business and within our geographic segments.","At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results of the quarter.","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Hopefully everyone's had a chance to review our press release this morning. As Joe mentioned, we expect to file our Form 10-Q with the SEC in the next few days, so please watch for that, as well.","Rob just spoke to the Australian joint venture. I just want to make it clear that we have a 49% interest in that venture. So from an accounting point of view, that means that we will not be consolidating the joint venture. There's essentially no income statement impact from that transaction in Q3 2013. What we expect is, in the future, we will show our share of net income or loss from the venture being reported on an after-tax basis as a single line in the income statement, below the income-tax provision line. If our investment gets large enough, it'll be shown as a separate line on the balance sheet, as a single line.","Beginning with revenue. Our Q3 2013 revenue of $1,298,000,000 was an increase of $281 million as compared to Q3 last year or an increase of 28%. This is our second consecutive quarterly revenue which is annualized to more than $5 billion. Our total organic growth of 10.8% was supplemented by 17.4% acquisition growth and we had about 0.5% of negative impact from foreign currency.","Parts and services revenue grew organically at 11.7%. And within that category, as Rob mentioned, our European operations continued to perform strongly with 32.9% organic growth. The North American parts and services' organic growth was also a healthy 6.2%. We did benefit from an extra selling day in Q3 2013 as compared to Q3 2012.","We saw other revenue increase by $19 million, a 14% increase. We record scrap and core revenue in other revenue. Acquisitions increased other revenue by $12 million. Or -- our organic growth in this line was $7 million positive as volume increases slightly more than offset lower commodity prices and the discontinuance of operations at one of our aluminum furnaces.","The trend I mentioned last quarter regarding other revenue continued this quarter. It remains important to the company because of its absolute size and contribution to the profitability of our recycling and self-service businesses. But as a percent of revenue, we saw other revenue fall again in Q3 this year to 11.9% of total revenue as compared to 13.4% in Q3 last year.","We will continue to experience short-term impacts from fluctuating commodity prices. But if the revenue trends continue, we expect that those fluctuations will become less significant to the overall business over time.","In Q3 2013, revenue for our self-serve business was $110 million or 8.5% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 32% of this revenue was parts sales, included in North American's parts and services and 68% scrap and core sales, included in Other revenue.","Our gross margin for Q3 2013 was $518 million or 39.9% of revenue, a decline of 40 basis points from our gross margin percentage of 40.3% in Q3 2012. The impact from the European segment was primarily an acquisition-driven decline, whereas the North American impact was an operationally driven improvement.","I had mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected Sator's impact to margins negatively both year-over-year and sequentially. We attributed 70 basis points of the year-over-year decline to Sator and a further 20 basis points to the U.K. paint business we bought part way through the quarter. As we've discussed in the past, paint has a lower gross margins. In Q4, we'll see a small additional negative impact from having those businesses the entire quarter.","In the North American segment, we saw an 80-basis-point improvement in the recycled margins, as we saw some benefits of our pricing programs and a reduction of the warranty cost. You may recall that we had a negative impact in Q3 2012 from warranty.","In North America, we also saw our self-service margins lower and thereby contributing 30 basis points to the lower company margin as the fall in car costs hasn't kept pace with the drop in scrap. Facility and warehouse costs were 8.3% of revenue in Q3 2013, a 20-basis-point improvement over 8.5% in Q3 last year. Our increased European operations are driving that figure lower and, in the U.K. in particular, where the infrastructure is being spread over more branch locations and a larger revenue base.","Distribution costs were 8.4% in this quarter as compared to 9.2% in the same quarter last year, an improvement of 80 basis points. Sator has lower distribution costs and that acquisition drove 30 basis points of the improvement. In North America and the U.K., we saw the benefits of higher revenue leveraging these costs. We also saw lower fuel costs contributing about 10 basis points to the group [indiscernible].","Selling and G&A expenses decreased from 11.9% of revenue in Q3 last year compared to 11.8% in Q3 this year, again related to Sator, as higher sales per customer and therefore lower SG&A cost.","In total, facility and warehouse distribution and SG&A costs were 29.6% of revenue in Q3 2012 as compared to 28.6% of revenue in Q3 2013, an improvement of 100 basis points.","I've mentioned that Sator accounts for approximately 40 to 50 basis points of that change. I mentioned on our last quarterly call that, excluding acquisitions, we appear to be getting operating leverage in these costs, at least for the last 2 quarters. Other revenue, which tends to require a limited amount of these costs, has been decreasing as a portion of our total revenue and actually fell faster this quarter compared to last, making this leverage all the more meaningful.","During Q3 this year, we recorded $2.2 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, primarily related to the U.K. paint acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was 1.6% of revenue during Q3 this year and last. Other expenses net increased to $14.4 million in the 3 months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $8.2 million in the same period last year, an increase of $6.2 million. Interest expense was $7.2 million higher due to higher debt levels combined with the higher interest rates on our senior notes.","Expenses in Q3 2013 related to adjustments of contingent consideration were $700,000 as compared to $1.9 million in the same period last year. Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 4.5%.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.6% compared to 35.1% in Q3 last year. We continue to see some benefit from lower foreign tax rates as our international business becomes a larger percentage of the company total. In Q3 2012, we had $1.3 million of favorable discrete adjustments to the taxes and, in Q3 this year, we had $2.9 million.","On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.24 in Q3 2013 as compared to $0.18 in Q3 2012. The combination of acquisition-related expenses and contingent purchase price adjustments impacted EPS by $0.01 for both Q3 in 2012 and 2013. On an adjusted basis, the diluted earnings per share was $0.25 this year as compared to $0.19 last year, or an improvement of 32%.","Switching to our year-to-date cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $341 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $182 million for the 9 months of -- first 9 months of 2012. During the first 9 months of 2013, our EBITDA increased by $71 million compared to the prior year period. While we generated greater pretax income in 2013 compared to 2012, we had lower cash payments for income taxes of $28 million due to the prepayments made in 2012. Cash payments for incentive comp were $14 million lower in the 9 months ended September 2013.","Other operating cash flows exceeded the prior year period, primarily due to the timing of payments of various accrued liabilities, such as value-added tax and interest. Capital spending was $61 million year-to-date, consistent with the same period last year. We've spent $396 million on acquisitions, the largest being Sator, which accounted for $273 million of the total. On the cash flow statement, you will note that we also have a $9 million investment in the unconsolidated subsidiary related to our Australian joint venture.","Year-to-date, we increased our net debt by $146 million. We ended Q3 with $1.3 billion of debt and cash and cash equivalents of $107 million. As of September 30, 2013, availability under our credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility was $1.2 billion, which, together with our cash balances, provides us with total liquidity of $1.3 billion.","Then turning to guidance. As we stated in the past, our guidance excludes any restructuring costs and transactions costs, gains, losses, contingent purchase price adjustments, capital expenditures or cash flows associated with acquisitions. At the moment, we're also assuming no material impact to the P&L from the Australian joint venture.","Our revised guidance for the full year. Organic growth for parts and services is 10% to 11.5%. We increased this range from 8.5% to 10.5% to reflect the stronger Q3 we reported this morning. We left unchanged our net income and earnings per share guidance. We increased our cash flow guidance from approximately $300 million to approximately $340 million. Our year-to-date cash flow from operations was $341 million. Our inventory levels in North America are actually about $25 million lower than they were at the beginning of the year, so we may have some inventory build between now and year end. That combined with the other potential movements in working capital may affect the quarter depending on the timing of various payments. But we still anticipate being significantly ahead of our original guidance for this metric.","We also reduced our expectation for capital spending from between $100 million and $115 million to a revised estimate of $85 million to $100 million.","We've managed to control the replacement capital spending. At this point we think a few of our bigger development projects we've budgeted will be pushed to next year. The higher cash flow from operations and the lower capital spending combine to provide a nice bump to our free cash flow for the year.","A couple of comments on how our guidance has evolved and how we're thinking about it. On the Q2 earnings call, we said that scrap prices had increased in July and we were expecting that to continue into August. Average scrap prices in Q3 were lower than in Q2, and that was a negative compared to our thinking on the last call. The prices we achieved for scrap in Q3 2013 were the lowest we've seen since Q3 2010. The drop in prices sequentially wasn't large enough to call out as having a material impact on our EPS but suffering a drop when we expected an increase was obviously still a negative to the quarter and potentially to the remainder of the full year.","The movement in the Manheim Index also went contrary to what we'd been expecting. On the Q2 call, we said that the index had been falling and that it had reached 119.7 at the end of June. Unfortunately, as opposed to continuing to fall, the index has risen every month since then and it was standing at 122.8 in September. So while we've seen some relief in car buying costs year-over-year, the improvement hasn't been as great as we had expected.","Having both scrap prices and the Manheim Index move against us as compared to where they were headed 90 days ago is obviously a short-term negative but it also points to the volatility of these items. If we see these materially improve that could help us get closer to the top of our guidance. And if they deteriorate further, our margins could see a little pressure in Q4.","The other item we've discussed internally is the timing of Christmas this year and how the increase of our European business might impact us. Christmas falls on a Wednesday. If our customers take that whole week as a vacation we could see a drop in our revenue and cash flow from operations in December. Last year, we saw our U.K. business decline in December and we would expect to see something similar this year also in the Benelux business.","I don't want to dwell on these items, as I believe they'll correct themselves over time. Meanwhile, the fundamentals that impact us look like they are continuing to improve. New car production continues to be strong and that will eventually lead to more late-model vehicle repairs and lower used car prices. Miles driven continues to be a positive this year. The acceptance of alternative parts continues to grow among our customers and the international expansion continues on pace.","With the expected -- with the increases in our guidance for cash flow and the reduction of expected capital expenditures, the company continues to be a strong generator of free cash flow, which we expect to continue to deploy on accretive acquisitions. And obviously, we view raising our organic growth guidance as a strong positive.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob before we open the call to questions.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, John. To summarize, we are pleased with our third quarter performance. As we approach the end of 2013, I am proud of the achievements we've made thus far. The North American market continues to grow in geography and product offerings and we are far from being fully built out. APU trends are favorable, certified parts continue to grow, vehicle procurement dynamics are improving and macro trends, such as miles driven, unemployment and gas prices are trending in our favor. These dynamics, coupled with our first-mover advantage on technological initiatives such as the CCC ONE integration have positioned our North American operations well for 2014 and beyond.","Also, the unique value proposition we offer to insurance carriers and the professional automotive repair industry transfers well outside of North America and we are pleased with the initial results of expanding that message into new geographic markets beyond the U.S. and Canada. We believe that great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together. Every day, our 23,000-plus employees work together to build a better company for our customers and shareholders. And for that, I say thank you.","Manny, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nate Brochmann of William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit on the organic growth, both for North America and Europe. Obviously, throughout the year, it's been steadily kind of improving. On the North American side, do you think that, that's more of your injection of kind of broadening the different parts throughout the different -- throughout the entire network and maybe taking some share? Or is it still a little bit more just because of the APU going up and the insurance carriers' kind of adoption rates improving? And then kind of similar question over to ECP. I mean, I think that continues to exceed everyone's expectations. Is that because of injecting more inventory there as well? Or just blocking and tackling in terms of marketing and sales efforts by the team over there in terms of winning business?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. Certainly in North America, Nate, it's everything you said. It's better acceptance by the insurance company. You left one important part out, is the certified parts. Certified parts are up 24.7% year-over-year. And as you know, many carriers specifically will only use certified parts. So I think it's a combination of better acceptance, certainly taking market share from the industry, as well. But certified parts are playing a role, as well. We are -- each and every month, we see better cross-selling by our reps, selling both salvage and aftermarket. So get our reps train very quickly on the dual systems. We made great strides over the years of having those systems communicate to each other. So I think it's a combination of all those factors. As far as the U.K. goes, yes, it's new product offerings. Certainly the collision parts program has helped add to that. The new store openings. It's amazing how quickly they come up to speed. Basically within 6 to 9 months, they're at breakeven. So great product training over there, new product offerings and really taking market share from the competition in that market, as well. So we're very pleased on both sides of the pond.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And with that, how are you feeling about the rollout potentially of some other product categories over there in the U.K., such as maybe recycled or getting some of the remanufactured business over there? I know that, that probably won't be as big as a percentage as we are in the U.S. just because of the land space but it does sound like there's an opportunity for that. Just wondering what you think maybe in terms of a timeline for that?","Robert L. Wagman","We are still looking at those opportunities, of course. As you know, in previous calls we mentioned that we challenged the insurance industry to adopt the aftermarket parts. As we mentioned on the call today, we've got another insurer that came over the wall. So we're down to 6 in the pilot and 2 in the full program. So we're feeling optimistic that we're obviously gaining acceptance of alternative parts. So we will continue to look at those alternatives, being salvage, reman. Obviously, we entered the paint market in August, so we've covered that leg of the stool. So we continue to look at opportunities, Nate, and as far as a timeline goes, nothing written in stone yet but certainly, as the acceptance of aftermarket gets better and better, we'll continue to look at that more and more closely.","Operator","The next question is from John Lawrence of Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Rob, would you comment a little bit about -- you mentioned obviously the progress with the CCC ONE integration. Can you talk a little bit about -- have you been able to dig through some of those orders? And what do those orders look like as far as not only from line items and ticket size, but just some kind of character of what they look like?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. John, we are looking at, obviously, the estimates in the orders that we're getting. One of the things that we're very pleased with -- one of the ancillary benefits that we didn't anticipate was a lower return percentage. It seems that when shops order their own parts, they do -- we just have a better accuracy on what part ordered [indiscernible]. They're substantially lower. So that certainly has been exciting. As far as looking at line by line, we believe most of these parts orders are basically supplemental to the phone call. However, what we haven't been able to determine yet, we're going to go with more research on this. What we suspect is likely happening is that if a shop called in looking for a fender, for example, the rep would take the order and be done. If the shop needs an inner fender, for example, it's a piece of plastic behind the fender, and didn't ask for it, we probably wouldn't have sold it. So we think now that, that part is automatically showing, there's a likelihood that we are getting some additional sales. Really hard to quantify because we don't know if that person would have asked for it on the call. But we're going to do some more research on that but our initial view of this program has been very good. I mean, you can see the growth, the return rates. We do expect the rollout of all 4,000 CCC shops that have this product -- they have many more customers but 4,000 have access to this product, will be done by year end. And we're really encouraged by the growth. So we think there's opportunities there, for sure.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Too early to know what that order cost you compared to a physical order at this point?","John S. Quinn","It's about comparable at the moment.","Robert L. Wagman","It seems to be comparable at the moment. Yes.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And just another question on -- if you look at the Australian joint venture, is there any timeline in that contract joint venture as far as, at the end of 3 years, what happens? Or a first exclusive right to buy more of that? Or how is that language at this point?","Robert L. Wagman","It is open-ended. I don't suspect that there -- at 3 years, we'll be having that kind of meeting. This will be a long-term partnership. It's a great partnership and, quite frankly, I can't think of a better way to enter a market than partnering with the #1 insurance company in the country. So -- and this is going to be a long-term deal for us.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And last question, John, how much -- of all the acquisitions mentioned, what kind of run rate and revenue is that?","John S. Quinn","Sure. In Q3, the acquisitions' annualized revenue was $170 million. And so, call it $42 million, roughly, a quarter. We reported about $30 million of that in Q3. So in Q4, you should see an incremental roughly about $12 million impact from the acquisitions.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Kennison of Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","John, maybe I'll just piggyback the previous question. What is the amount of acquired revenue that is assumed in guidance?","John S. Quinn","It's the -- incremental for Q4? It's just the acquisition we've announced, which is about $12 million in Q4 incremental revenue.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is there a total annual figure that you're able to share?","John S. Quinn","We can dig that up. I don't know if I have it right in front of me. The annualized acquired revenue in Q3 was $170 million. Is that what you're asking?","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. So the Q3 revenue contribution from acquired businesses is $170 million?","Robert L. Wagman","On an annualized basis, of which $30 million was reported in Q3.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That is helpful. Rob, maybe shifting to the Benelux region. You've had Sator for a few months now. I'm curious about what you've learned, what has surprised you and how you see that European model evolving, given you've got different distribution models in the U.K. and Continental Europe?","Robert L. Wagman","Craig, as I mentioned on my prepared remarks that we're very pleased with the synergies that we're going to achieve and we're on target to do that. As we noted, there are very little distribution synergies because, obviously, the U.K. is literally an island from the Benelux market. But I'm very pleased, really starting to learn the territory with our customer base and looking at opportunities to add new products, which we are doing. There were some products that were available in the U.K. that have now been introduced into the Benelux market. As far as the future of the rollout and the different distribution models, we continue to do our due diligence on other markets. As I mentioned on previous calls, there is a Sator, an ECP in every country that -- every European country that we are looking at. So there's small regional players, no pan-European distributor. So we will continue to look at those markets, do our due diligence. I think, in time, we will look to expand that model. We do believe different countries have different models, of course, the U.K. being 2-step and the Benelux being 3-step. We certainly see that across different European countries, the 2- and 3-step models mixed in different countries. And we will certainly look at different opportunities as those markets present themselves. But really, really just still in our due diligence phase of which markets present the best opportunities today.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then finally, I know you're about to embark on a series of meetings with your regions around the country. If you've proceeded with any of those, do you have an early impression on trends and what the outlook for 2014 might look like?","John S. Quinn","We actually haven't started those. We kick off with our U.K. trip early next year -- next month. So too early to give any feedback.","Operator","The next question is from Bret Jordan with BB&T Capital Markets.","David Lee Kelley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","This is actually David Kelley in for Brett this morning. A couple of questions and really just first piggybacking off of the previous question on the expectations for Sator. But here going forward, I think you mentioned that business was roughly 70 basis points headwind gross margins in the quarter. And just wondering if you can provide a little bit of color on your expectations for gross margin impact and when it potentially could be accretive to aggregate gross margins? And maybe sequential expectations heading into the fourth quarter, as well?","John S. Quinn","It's John speaking, David. What we said was that the EBITDA -- I'll talk to EBITDA, our gross margins' are similar impact. Those margins are below what ECP does. Part of that's because of the 2-step versus the 3-step model. What we said at the time of the acquisition is that we think of it in 2 years, 2 to 3 years, we should be able to achieve procurement synergies that should close that gap and have the margins come up to be similar to the ECP margins. I don't know that it would be accretive but I think at least it won't be dilutive within 2 years. Those acquisition synergies seem to be on track, so I don't think we've changed our thinking on that regard.","David Lee Kelley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. Just [indiscernible]. So no change on the timeline there. A quick question, as well, on the tax rate, 32.6% or so for the quarter. I think on the second quarter conference call, you mentioned for the full year looking at a plus or minus 35%, given a few basis points either way. Any expectations or change in expectations in the annualized tax rate given the significant growth that continues in Europe?","John S. Quinn","No. The Q2 -- excuse me, Q3 was benefited both this year and last year for some discrete items, which you record those in the period as opposed to in the blended full year rate. So we don't anticipate, for this year, being materially different from that 35%. It could be a little bit higher, a little bit lower, depending on the mix of the income and the timing of any perms that we happen to have. But I don't anticipate that. The U.K. rate is coming down. That's what drove the discrete item this quarter, primarily. So the U.K. tax rates are indeed going down, which obviously makes the European business more attractive on an after-tax basis. So as that business grows and becomes a little bit bigger portion, you will see our tax rate drift down over the next couple of years but not material at this point.","Operator","The next question is from John Lovallo of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question is on operating margin expansion. Over the past couple of quarters, you guys have done a nice job generating, call it, 60 to 70 basis points of year-over-year expansion. And I think historically, that was kind of the target range that you guys had talked about. And this follows a couple of quarters, prior to the past 2, that we've seen some contraction in the margin. I guess the question is, are you feeling more comfortable, call it, the acquisitions in Europe or just better execution in North America? Are you feeling you're a little bit more confident that you could return to, call it, that 60 to 70 basis points of year-over-year expansion on an ongoing basis?","John S. Quinn","I think we've often talked about the business model and if we can grow organically, call it, 5% to 8% and then supplement that with some acquisition. We've always said it's going to be a bit lumpy but we believe that over time, we ought to be able to get operating income expansion. And I think that model has worked out precisely the way we've described it in the last couple of quarters because we have had the benefit of the acquisitions we did last year. We did 30 acquisitions last year and some fairly significant acquisitions this year. And we've been blessed with some strong organic growth. So I think that model is continuing. We believe that we're going to continue to have organic growth and acquisition activity in the coming years, so it is -- somebody asked about our focus on the budgets. That is one of the discussion points that we have with our field every budget season, and we hammer it home throughout the year, is what we refer to as operating leverage, which means getting an extra dollar of revenue and having more than that marginally following through to the bottom line in terms of the percentage that we normally see. So we still believe in that. It will be lumpy and some of it does get driven by the impact of the commodity prices. The nice thing that we're seeing right now is that commodity prices, although they're falling, we are still seeing that operating leverage come through because when that other income shrinks it puts a little bit of pressure on the operating margin. We have mentioned to overcome that the last couple of quarters, as you've noticed.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And if we think about Suncorp and just kind of the Australian market, would you say that kind of the same barriers to entry exist there? Meaning the need for permits and things of that nature?","Robert L. Wagman","Actually, John, I think it's much better. Certainly there are some permits to getting the salvage-yard operations but certainly going in with the insurer as a partner makes the sale part of it easier. I was actually in Australia last week, looking at the operation, potential operations, and I don't think it's going to be a major barrier to get the zoning permits we need. We're also looking at possibly acquisition opportunities, as well, so -- in the event that does become a barrier. But we are optimistic that we can get up and running relatively quickly. It'll take some time but certainly within a couple of quarters, we expect to be -- start selling our first products. Likely be aftermarket initially but the salvage operations will open relatively quickly, I think, considering what we have to get done in the meantime.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. I'll leave it there. I'm sorry, go ahead John?","John S. Quinn","I was just going to say, those cars are all being handled today. There is an end-of-life program for vehicles in Australia right now. So I would think that, with us bringing our professional standards, we should not have a major issue. We really are only talking about 3 major markets that we're going to hit initially.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Bill Armstrong of CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","You mentioned miles driven earlier. We saw it was up in July and August. Does that help Q3 at all? Or should we see more of an impact maybe in Q4?","Robert L. Wagman","Miles driven for the year are up 0.8% -- I'm sorry, for year-over-year Q3. We do expect some of the trends we're seeing, gas prices certainly stabilized, if not down, in many markets. I anticipate miles driven to continue to be at least steady, if not slightly up, and that certainly won't hurt us, with miles driven increasing.","John S. Quinn","At this time of year, most of the accidents get repaired within probably 4 to 6 weeks. In the winter time, sometimes the drivables get extended a little bit. We saw a little bit of that probably in Q2, and got some benefit from the winter in Q3. I think most of the increase that we saw last quarter is probably flushed through the system by now. But obviously, the point, I guess, I was trying to make was that the trend, at least, has started to turn a little bit, it appears, from suffering from negative miles driven to a positive.","Robert L. Wagman","And one other thing I'd add to that, Bill, going back to Nate's question from the beginning about organic growth. One of the trends that we really like seeing is that SAR [ph] rate improving. These are going to be late-model cars fully insured. So with a SAR [ph] rate over $16 million, and I've seen estimates next year in the $17 million range, that bodes well for both the collision repair industry and our business, in that later-model cars tend to be more insured or insured in the first place. So we think long term the trends are looking better, for sure.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And in the U.K., this paint distributor that you bought in the third quarter, is that going to be folded into ECP? And will those products be included in these exclusive deals that you've announced with these insurance companies?","Robert L. Wagman","They will be -- actually, there were 5 paint deals, by the way, rolled into one. But there were 5 separate companies we did. They will be merged with ECP delivery in many cases. We anticipate 4 closures by the end of this year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, Bill, this gives us virtual U.K. coverage. We may have to open 1 or 2 or 3 branches just to fill out some geographic holes but there will be some integration with the ECP branches and delivery wherever we can. As far as offerings to the paint -- to the insurance companies as part of those deals, those tend to be separate. The U.K. has always had paint deals separately with insurance companies. However, we do plan on leveraging those relationships where we have parts relationships, we don't paint, we'll leverage that and vice versa. So insurers are very much involved in the repair process in the U.K. as compared to the United States. So that will definitely benefit us long-term, those relationships, on both sides.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question for John, on the guidance. I think you might have addressed this and I might have just missed it but your cash flow from operations guidance is up about $40 million. Your earnings guidance is unchanged. Is the difference just in changes in working capital or is there something else?","John S. Quinn","It's mainly just the timing of working capital. And I mentioned that our inventories in the North America is actually down year-over-year. We probably will have a little bit of a build later this year. I wouldn't read too much into it, Bill.","Operator","The next question is from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. At least it appears as though, for the acquisitions you made this quarter, you paid less on a per-sales basis than you did for the beach-head deals. Is that accurate from an EBITDA standpoint, also? And should we continue to expect that your European deals would be at lower multiples?","John S. Quinn","I think the big deal, the paint transactions, they are a lower-gross margin business, frankly. So you tend to do, when you look at the economics and all of the cash flows -- we're paying on the cash flows as opposed to the revenue multiple. So I think it's safe to say that it's within our normal parameters in terms of the acquisition deals but you're probably right. There probably is a little bit more revenue per dollar of acquisition cost because the EBITDA is less, the percentage of EBITDA.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Shouldn't we see multiples of subsequent acquisitions come down though, as the need for a beach head is diminished and they become more plug-and-play?","John S. Quinn","Obviously, we always pay as little as we can but it's going to depend on the asset. If we were to enter the salvage market, that would be a new market for us. We tend to try to buy the best companies that we can whenever we enter our market. So whether it's into a new geographic on the continent or whether it's a new product line within the U.K. or the Benelux area, we're going to look for the best companies. We're going to pay based on the cash flows and it's going to be based on the competitive situation, as well.","Robert L. Wagman","But I do think it's a fair statement, Sam, that the first guy in the box does tend to get a little bit higher multiple, generally speaking. I can assure you that the second deal we announced in the Benelux did not transpire at the same multiple of the first one. So I think it's a fair statement.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two more quick questions, if I could. First off, are you seeing the tipping point either occur or imminent -- is imminent to occur where the U.K. insurance premiums are getting cut by those carriers that are participating in your programs?","Robert L. Wagman","We have not seen that yet. However, there's still an ongoing investigation by the Office of Fair Trade over in the U.K., looking into premiums. So I think everything's on hold until they get done with their investigation. But we certainly expect that to be the ultimate result at some point.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And last question. It was interesting, you said that your vehicle costs at auction have not reflected what Manheim is suggesting. What's typically, Rob, in your experience, the lag? And might this be a potential upside, if you're not seeing it? And to Q4, where you might not see the uptick in auction vehicle prices?","Robert L. Wagman","It's interesting, Sam, we've actually seen Manheim tick up and our costs have ticked down a little bit. So we actually are seeing opposite in a good way. So we do expect that Manheim to tip at some point. And just my talk with various industry players, in particular CCC, who we talk to constantly, who watches the Manheim Index very closely, they were actually a little surprised that it hasn't started to come down. But they are expecting that to start ticking down as these used cars start to hit the marketplace. So we do expect some relief. We said on a previous call, Sam, we saw that correlation on the way up, where Manheim got higher, we were paying more. We're actually pretty pleased with Manheim ticking slightly up last quarter, yet our prices did drop nicely. So we do expect good things coming when that drops.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","As I understood it, John, though your guidance for Q4 at least, assumes that Manheim will provide pressure on vehicle prices, though?","John S. Quinn","We're assuming it'll stay at the status quo. I guess the point I was trying to make, Sam, was that in Q2 we saw the Manheim coming down, so it turned around and started going back up. We didn't see as much benefit as we anticipated. As Rob said, we did get a little bit of benefit and I think that was reflected in the North American gross margins, a little bit. But right now we're not forecasting Manheim to go up or down particularly.","Robert L. Wagman","And to further complicate the matter, Sam, we saw a reduction in scrap prices. So we know some of that decrease in cost was related to scrap, not necessarily Manheim going one way or the other. So we're not sure where scrap's going. I can tell you scrap in October was actually slightly down compared to Q3. I'm not sure where it's going in November, December, but we've seen a little bit more pressure in the scrap market. So that's still up in the air, too. But that's certainly causing some relief at the auctions, in spite of where Manheim is going.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Stember of Sidoti & Company.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Rob, could you talk about, in the U.S., any appreciable difference between what you're seeing on the recycled side versus the aftermarket?","Robert L. Wagman","No. Actually, when we look at the AP usages, they're both getting small gains, or minor variations on both sides. But the salvage markets remain strong. We track the number of cars at auctions. They've been very steady. Aftermarket continues to put certified parts in, as I said, and continue to open up new products to us in terms of when new models come out. I think they're both really steadily just moving along.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And back to the comment you made about certified parts being up in the high-20% range, I guess, through the first 3 quarters of the year. Are you referring to NSF program and other, like, capital programs, as well?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. I remember in all 3, we have our own quality assurance program. That is up, cap is up and NSF is up. And combined, they were up 24.7%, Scott.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, got you. All right, and just last question. I know you have a lot to bite on with -- in the U.K. and the collision side. But can you just remind us again the eventual opportunity over in Western Europe to grow that piece of the business and a timeline on your expectations?","Robert L. Wagman","The total carpark is roughly 250 million cars as compared to the U.S. of 245 million. We had our Vice President of Insurance Relations head over to the Benelux market to start initial discussions on the continent with insurers. We're very pleased with at least the initial discussions. And again, one thing we've always liked, Scott, is that the insurers in the U.K. are also the insurers on the continent, many times, many cases. So there's some overlap. So we're convinced, if we can pull this off in the U.K., and again, 80% growth year-over-year. We're very pleased getting that second insurance company into a program has been very good. And certainly we expect to bring this onto the continent in time. As far as a timeline goes, I've instructed our teams over there that let's continue to work on the synergies we have. But I expect to have our insurance team back over there probably spring or summer at the latest to start looking at more substantive programs on the continent.","John S. Quinn","Manny, we probably only have time for one more quick call. I want to be respectful of everyone's time.","Operator","The next question is from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'll be brief because of my questions have been answered. But Rob, you called out 4,000 shops by rollout with this intelligent system from CCC. Is that a maximum because these are the better shops that CCC deals with? Or is that just a goal by the end of, say, 2014?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes. Gary, those are the shops that have access to this particular product of CCC. They have many, many, many more customers that currently just haven't stepped up to this package. They certainly could grow if CCC is successful in selling that product. They have, I would imagine, 20,000-plus customers -- 25,000-plus body shop customers across the U.S. So they can continue to sell this product and get more into it. So the 4,000 are the ones that have access to it today and they will have access by the end of this year.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then lastly, you had called out, about 1 year or so ago or 2 years ago, you had done some kind of integration with Mitchell. Is that kind of the same thing that you've done with CCC and you don't really call that out in the conference calls? Or is that something entirely different?","Robert L. Wagman","Very similar, but the difference is that the CCC is interactive within the estimate. And I think honestly, that's why it's been so much more successful than the Mitchell. Mitchell's plan is to integrate that in time. They just haven't gotten that done yet. One last thing on the CCC product that is going to launch in Q4. It's a salvage interaction. Right now, our current program with CCC is basically just the aftermarket. We do plan on getting the salvage part launched by the end of Q4.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wagman for any additional remarks.","Robert L. Wagman","Okay, thank you, and thank you, everyone, for the time this morning and we look forward to speaking to you in the new year when we report our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. Have a great holiday season, everyone. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."],"13224":["LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) Q2 2014 Earnings Call July 31, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Joseph P.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Boutross, Director, Investor Relations for LKQ Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Boutross, you may begin.","Joseph P. Boutross","Thanks, Devin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we released our second quarter 2014 financial results.","In the room with me today are Rob Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Quinn, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rob and John have some prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions.","In addition to the telephone access for today's call, we are providing an audiocast via the LKQ website. A replay of the audiocast and conference call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call.","Before we begin with our discussion, I would like to remind everyone that the statements made in this call that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are currently unknown to us.

And as normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days.","And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Wagman.","Robert L. Wagman","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today.","In Q2, revenue reached a new quarterly high of $1.71 billion, an increase of 36.5% as compared to Q2 2013. Net income for the second quarter of 2014 was $104.9 million, an increase of 38.5% as compared to $75.7 million for the same period of 2013.","Diluted earnings per share of $0.34 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014, increased 36% from $0.25 for the second quarter of 2013. Please note that adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2014 would have been $0.35 compared to $0.26 for the second quarter of 2013 after adjusting for any net losses resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, losses of debt extinguishment and the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.","During the quarter, we achieved organic revenue growth and acquisition revenue growth for parts and services of 8.1% and 31%, respectively. I am particularly pleased with this performance, given we were able to translate this revenue growth into an improved bottom line, with a 39% increase in net income and a 36% increase in diluted EPS, despite the tough year-over-year comparatives.","Now more detail on our North American operations. During the second quarter, we purchased over 71,000 vehicles for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is a 2.4% decrease from Q2 2013. While our purchases were slightly down year-over-year in Q2, the backlog from a strong Q1 purchasing environment left us with solid inventory levels of product to continue the growth of our recycled parts operations in Q2 and now into Q3.","In our self-service retail businesses, during the second quarter, we acquired approximately 143,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars as compared to over 135,000 in Q2 of 2013 or roughly a 6% increase.","Lastly, in our North American operations, I want to update everyone on State Farm and their previously announced use of aftermarket certified chrome front and rear bumpers. During the quarter, sales of this particular part type were up 22% year-over-year, which we believe is partially attributable to State Farm. At this point, we are not aware of State Farm considering a broader use of our aftermarket offerings, but we do remain encouraged, given that we estimate they are witnessing savings of approximately 20% on this part type alone. Clearly, a broader program which includes aftermarket other sheet metal and body panels, offers State Farm and its policyholders tremendous economic benefits.","Now turning to our European operations. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of Euro Car Parts and its ability to increase market share. In Q2, ECP achieved organic revenue growth of 22.3%. For branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 14.4% during the quarter. This performance was particularly impressive given that ECP had 1 less selling day year-over-year. Also during the quarter, ECP opened 9 branches, bringing our total to 20 for the year, the number we initially scheduled for 2014.","Given the recent disruption with one of our main competitors in the U.K. market, we are currently assessing whether or not we will accelerate the opening of additional branches this year.","And now an update on ECP's collision program. During the quarter, we continued to win strong double-digit year-over-year growth of over 33% with our collision parts sales at ECP despite the headwind of an extremely mild winter in the U.K. and, again, 1 less selling day.","In addition, during the second quarter, ECP added 2 additional insurers into ECP's pilot program, bringing our total carrier relationship to 17. These 2 new carriers each signed agreements identifying ECP as the first distributor of choice for non-OE collision parts with their respective body shop networks. I am quite pleased with the carrier penetration we have achieved since we launched ECP's collision program and pleased to note that these 17 carriers represent well over 80% of the auto insurance market in the U.K.","And lastly, on Europe, on May 30, 2014, the company completed its acquisition of 5 Netherlands parts distributors, all of which were customers of Sator. Combined, these distributors added 52 branches to Sator's Netherlands network. Strategically, this deal accelerates our efforts in converting Sator's distribution network from a 3-step to a 2-step model, strengthens our growth and prospects and margin profile and positions the business well for eventual entry into the alternative collision parts market in the Benelux. Although it is still early, these 5 acquisitions are meeting our expectations.","Now to our Specialty segment. Keystone Specialty continues to outperform many of our operational and financial expectations. John will cover the financial performance for our Specialty segment, but operationally, I'd like to give you a brief update on Keystone.","Just finalizing the acquisition in January, Keystone has closed 12 cross dock facilities and added an additional 36 drop points into existing wholesale operations. This cross dock initiative has reduced our driving distances and improved our customer experiences, while allowing us to reinvest resources toward adding more frequent deliveries and building the delivery network capable of handling more revenue growth going forward. Furthermore, we are well on our way to launching our new distribution center in Texas, which will be operational later this year and provide additional access to a substantial truck and off-road market.","In addition, Keystone continues to make great progress identifying cross-selling opportunities for our existing products. Keystone, through recent systems and sales exploration efforts, now offers over 1,000 collision SKUs, an ATK remanufactured engine line and over 20,000 SKUs from our Goodmark aftermarket muscle car and classic lines to their Specialty customers.","Lastly on Keystone, in July, all HR functions have been fully integrated into LKQ processes, and efforts in other administrative areas are on target.","Moving on to acquisitions and development initiatives. In addition to the acquisition of the 5 Netherlands parts distributors, during the second quarter of 2014, LKQ made 6 additional acquisitions, all of them in North America, including a paint distributor in Texas; a self-serve yard in Georgia; a paint distributor with 6 locations in Ontario; a paint distributor in New York; an aftermarket collision parts distributor with locations in Florida and Georgia; and finally, a tire recycler in Ohio.","As we enter the back half of the year, we continue to witness a steady flow of M&A opportunities in the geographies and segments in which we operate.","Given the strength of our balance sheet and operational capabilities, I believe we are well positioned to execute on more strategic acquisitions.","At this time, I'd like to ask John Quinn to provide some more detail on the financial results of the quarter.","John S. Quinn","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.","Rob mentioned that the top line revenue of $1.7 billion for the quarter was an increase of $457 million or 37% over the $1.25 billion we achieved in Q2 2013. This is the second consecutive quarter LKQ is annualizing revenue in excess of $6.5 billion, with quarterly EBITDA over $200 million and net income over $100 million. So overall, pretty solid back-to-back quarters.","The revenue growth breaks down as follows: For Q2, our total organic revenue growth was 6.6%, and we delivered additional growth of 28.3% from acquisitions, with foreign exchange adding a further 1.7%. Organic growth for parts and services was 8.1%. Within that, we saw our North American operations grow organically 5.3%, while the European segment grew 15.6%. We were facing a difficult comparison to Q2 2013 in the North American segment when we reported 7.3%. Although we believe the shops had good backlogs going into Q2 this year, they had a similar situation last year with the late winter in 2013.","The European segment showed lower growth as we've included Sator for the first time. ECP continues to show strong organic growth of 22%, but Sator had an organic revenue decline of 6.9%. The Sator negative growth appears to be related to general market conditions, particularly for some of our private label product, which was exported, and the impact of acquisitions on the base business. With the acquisition of some of our major customers and converting the distribution to a 2-step model, we anticipated some loss of revenue in the base business. Meanwhile, as Rob mentioned, the sales of the garages by our newly acquired distributors are progressing well.","Acquisitions completed in the last 12 months to June 30 contributed $354 million to Q2 2014 revenue on a reported basis, including $25 million from acquisitions completed in Q2 2014. The annualized revenue from acquisitions completed in Q2 2014 is approximately $220 million or roughly $55 million per quarter.","I know we've got some questions about our Specialty segment, which is where we are reporting the revenue for Keystone Specialty, the company we acquired in January this year. For Q2 2014, our revenue for that segment was $218 million. While we didn't own Keystone last year, we estimated that their revenue was $196 million for Q2, so that business grew 11% year-over-year, hence, Rob's comments of our being pleased with its progress.","Total change in other revenue, which is where we record our scrap commodity sales, was positive 7%. While acquisitions contributed 11% positive growth, that was offset by negative 4% growth from our existing business. We saw a decline in both pricing and volumes, with pricing being down on scrap steel about 5% and our volumes of aluminum and other precious metals lower year-over-year. The average price we received for scrap steel was $217 per ton this year versus $228 per ton in Q2 2013.","Other revenue was 9.8% of total revenue compared to 12.6% in the same period last year, reflecting the declining relative importance of this revenue to our overall results.","In Q2 2014, revenue from our self-service business was $109 million or 6.4% of LKQ's total revenue. Approximately 32% of this revenue is parts sales included in North American parts and services revenue and 68% scrap and core sales included in other revenue. A year ago, in Q2 2013, our self-serve business was 8.8% of revenue. The lower percentage this year reflects the lower commodity prices and the faster growth of our other lines of business.","Our reported gross margin for Q2 2014 was $671 million or 39.3% of revenue, a decline of approximately 140 basis points from our gross margin percentage of 40.7% in Q2 2013.","The primary reason for this decrease was a 210 basis point decline attributable to acquisitions completed after March 2013, including 120 basis points related to the specialty acquisition and 90 basis points from other acquisitions. Excluding these items, we saw an improvement of about 70 basis points in the North American operating margins.","Moving to our operating expenses. Some of the comparisons are being affected by the Specialty and Sator acquisitions, which both operate 3-step models to some extent. In this model, gross margins tend to be lower than in the 2-step approach, but they incur relatively lower facility, distribution and SG&A costs. Sator will not affect these comparisons as much going forward because it was in Q2 2013 for 2 of the 3 months. Specialty will affect comparisons for the remainder of the year.","Facility and warehouse costs were 7.5% of revenue in Q2 2014, a 70 basis point improvement over 8.2% in Q2 last year. This improvement is primarily due to the Specialty acquisition, which tends to run at lower facility costs than the rest of our operations. Distribution costs increased slightly from 8.5% of revenue in Q2 2013 to 8.6% this quarter. This change is mainly attributable to higher costs in the U.K., which is associated with the new branch openings and offset by lower costs from the Specialty segment.","Selling and G&A expenses decreased from 11.7% of revenue in Q2 last year to 10.9% in Q2 this year, an improvement of 80 basis points. Keystone Specialty accounts for 50 basis points of the improvement, but we also saw operating leverage in the balance of the business with a 30 basis point improvement.","The combination of facility and warehouse, distribution and SG&A costs was 27% of revenue in Q2 2014 as compared to 28.4% in Q2 2013. I've explained much of this improvement is due to the acquisitions we've completed, but it's worth pointing out again that the drop of other revenue relative to the total revenue is masking the leverage we're achieving in the base business. It's hard to accurately quantify the exact impact, but as I've pointed out in the past, other revenue tends to incur very little incremental cost on these line items.","During Q2 2014, we recorded $5.9 million of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, up from $3.7 million in Q2 last year 2014 costs primarily related to the specialty and Netherlands acquisitions.","Depreciation and amortization was 1.8% of revenue during Q2 this year as compared to 1.5% of revenue in Q2 2013. This increase is due to higher amortization related to intangibles, particularly from the Sator and Specialty acquisitions.","Other expenses, net, decreased to $13.9 million in the 3 months ended June 2014 compared to $14.9 million in the same period last year, a decrease of $1 million.","The main components of the change include interest expense which was $3.1 million higher, with $4.6 million attributable to higher debt levels and a $1.5 million reduction from lower interest rates.","During Q2 2013, we included -- we incurred a $2.8 million loss related to the debt extinguishment costs. Adjustments to contingent consideration were income of $0.8 million in Q2 this year as compared to an expense of $200,000 last year in the same period.","Our effective borrowing rate for the quarter was 3.4%.","Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 34% compared to 35.4% in the first half of 2013, reflecting our growing International business, which has lower tax rates.","On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.34 in Q2 2014 compared to $0.25 in Q2 2013, an improvement of 36%. Adjusting for the combination of restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, contingent purchase price adjustments and the loss on debt extinguishment, EPS would have been $0.01 higher both this year and last. So on an adjusted basis, Q2 2014 would have been $0.35 as compared to $0.26 last year.","Switching to our year-to-date cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $152 million through 6 months in 2014 compared to $209 million in 2013. Net income and depreciation were favorable to cash flow by $49 million and $19 million, respectively, but those are offset by a change in the use of cash of $35 million related to inventories.","In Q2 -- excuse me, in Q1 2013, we entered the quarter with inventories at fairly high levels, so Q1 last year saw the benefit in our cash flow. In 2014, we increased inventories in Europe in anticipation of the branch expansion and at specialty ahead of the busy summer season, resulting in inventories being a use of cash this year.","Similarly, accounts receivable has been $21 million higher use of cash this year, reflecting the strong sales growth year-over-year and the seasonality of the specialty business.","Accounts payable has been a use of cash this year compared to a source of cash last year, creating the $35 million year-over-year change in cash flow.","Timing of cash taxes resulted to a higher outflow of funds in 2014 compared to 2013 of $25 million.","Capital spending was $67 million in the first 6 months of 2014 and we've spent $635 million in cash on acquisitions, the largest being Specialty, which accounted for $427 million of the total.","If you recall, in Q1, we refinanced our credit facility, increasing the total size of the facility to $2.3 billion and extending the maturity until May 2019. We ended Q2 2014 with $1,951,000,000 of debt, and cash and cash equivalents were $110 million. Availability under our credit facility is approximately $1.1 billion, and with cash, total liquidity was about $1.2 billion. So we have capacity to pursue additional acquisitions as suitable opportunities arise.","And now turning to guidance. We increased the bottom end of our income guidance, with the new guidance calling for net income between $405 million and $430 million. That equates to a revised earnings per share guidance of $1.32 to $1.40. We left the remainder of our guidance unchanged from February. Our guidance for 2014 for organic revenue growth for parts and services is 8% to 10%, and our guidance for capital expenditures is $110 million to $140 million, with cash flow from operations of approximately $375 million.","A few general comments on what we are seeing in the business and how it's reflected in our guidance.","North American wholesale continues to remain fairly steady in terms of volume and costs. We've seen slight upticks in the miles driven and in the last few years, higher new vehicle production is slowly working its way into our sweet spot of our market.","While new car production initially hurts us because many insurance companies will not use alternative parts until the car is a few years old, ultimately, we believe we will see favorable improvements in the age profile of the car part, which will be helpful. We haven't seen any appreciable change in used car prices and are paying more for vehicles this year than last. We remain ever hopeful that used car prices will fall and we'll begin to get a benefit, but that hasn't shown up in any appreciable manner.","A little less than 10% of our revenue are self-serve business and scrap volumes are still important to our company. In Q2, we saw another sequential drop in prices of about 3% for scrap steel. That seems to have stabilized, and our car buying in that line of business has been adjusted to the lower scrap levels.","Our European operations continue to see what I would describe as sluggish demand, particularly on the continent. We thought we might see an uptick from the delayed winter spending, but that really hasn't been the case. We saw our largest aftermarket competitor in the U.K. go into receivership this month, which is probably a reflection of the difficult market conditions there, along with our success of our branch expansion. We are optimistic that we'll be able to obtain some of that revenue that the company had previously been enjoying.","The acquisition integrations are going well. Rob mentioned that Keystone Specialty is slightly ahead of our expectations. Our recent acquisitions in the Netherlands are performing in line with our goals. Although it's early days, we remain confident that we are on the right strategy.","I would remind everyone that the U.K. paint acquisitions completed in August last year will begin to anniversary in Q3, but they will not -- they are not growing at the same rate as Europe as a whole. So that will adversely impact our reported European organic growth. On the flip side, we had the benefit of 21 new branches we opened in Europe in the first half of the year, and we expect those to contribute to the top line growth.","Historically, Q4 has been one of LKQ's stronger quarters, but our product mix has changed. We expect the European operations in our Specialty segment to slow in Q4, which will dampen the improved results we normally expect in our collision business in North America. Both Christmas and New Year's will fall on a Thursday this year, which may also cause some disruption to normal revenue and cash flow patterns.","Aside from those items, we do keep an eye on foreign exchange, particularly as Europe continues to grow and on the ongoing scrap volatility and weather in the balance of the year. I believe that Arthur is the only named storm that reached landfall so far this year, and from our perspective, we saw a very little impact.","Before I turn the call back to Rob, I just want to take a moment put the results of our first half of this year into perspective. In full year 2011, we had revenue for the year of $3.3 billion and net income of $210 million. In the first half of 2014, our revenue was $3.3 billion and our net income was $210 million. We accomplished in 6 months of 2014 what it took us a full year to achieve in 2011.","Over the years, Rob and I have answered numerous questions regarding our acquisition and growth strategies, and we frequently respond to questions regarding how these acquisitions impact our gross margin or operating margins. I believe what it is telling about the comparison I just made is that despite doubling our size, we maintained the net income margins. It sometimes takes a bit of time to integrate our acquisitions and they will be quarterly fluctuations, but over time, when it comes to the bottom line, and by that, I mean, to include the impact of differing tax rates, we are demonstrating remarkably -- remarkable consistency in the execution of our strategy. And that, I believe, is what makes LKQ a unique company. We're growing parts and services revenue organically at a reasonably high rate, for example, 8.1% this past quarter, and we've also consistently acquired and integrated good companies and growing them at similar rates. It's rare to find a company with the markets and the skill set to both execute organic growth and acquisitions with the kind of consistency that LKQ has shown.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob before we open to questions.","Robert L. Wagman","Thanks, John. To summarize, we are quite pleased with our results in the second quarter and the first half of the year and we are optimistic of what lies ahead for our company.","Looking ahead, in North America, the recent upswing and trend in new vehicle sales bodes well for our collision business because newer vehicles tend to be fully insured with higher premiums and lower deductibles, and if financed, lien holders require the owner of the vehicle to carry mandatory insurance coverage. New cars are more valuable, so they are less likely to total, and from our perspective this means that newer cars are more likely to be repaired than an older vehicle.","We also believe that as more new cars are sold, used car prices will eventually fall, which is good for us because it should reduce the cost of salvaged vehicles we procure for our North American recycling business.","Simply put, increased new vehicle sales equate to more insured repairs and, therefore, more opportunities for LKQ. The increase in new vehicle sales is also a favorable trend for our new Specialty segment because the most common time for someone to modify their vehicle with specialty products is in the first 2 years of vehicle ownership. The performance of our Specialty segment in the second quarter, I believe, was in part a result of this trend.","In Europe, we are in the early innings with capitalizing on the opportunities in that segment. Over the last 3 years, we've gained tremendous knowledge with the success of ECP and their ability to gain share in the U.K. market.","Our objective is to replicate ECP's exceptional 2-step distribution and logistics model, in the industry-leading fill rates with Sator and the recent acquisition of the 5 distributors in the Netherlands. And of course, we intend on expanding this model into other European markets and remain committed to our European strategy and the long-term growth prospects for this segment.","In closing, our team of over 28,000 employees, working across our geographic and operating segments, collaborate daily to leverage their combined operational expertise with a common goal of maximizing our growth and diversification strategy. This collaboration, coupled with our ability to successfully identify, acquire, integrate and grow these businesses, continues to create a long-term value for our stockholders.","Operator, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel.","James J. Albertine - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask you on ECP. I heard you on the addition of 2 insurers, now you're at 17 over -- I think you said well over 80% of the insurance market there. I just wanted to understand how did the market, overall -- from an alternative parts penetration perspective, how long did it take to get to 7%? And what's your view on how that 7% can work higher? Is it something that can spike as auto insurance providers sort of change their tone on alternative parts? Or is this going to be more of a gradual sort of improvement over time? And then as it relates to that, I figured I'll just ask the follow-up now. Given your competitor -- business competitor weakness and your growth, geographically speaking, how much better positioned are you now to leverage that APU growth?","Robert L. Wagman","Sure. The 7%, Jamie, it was basically when we arrived in the U.K. were roughly 5% to 7%. But we think we've had, obviously, a positive impact so we continue to grow the marketplace. But the answer to your question, it really depends on the insurer. The insurer has to buy in -- and of course, I think why we're so successful here in the United States with alternative parts because the insurance company is, in fact, pushing the alternative parts. The nice part about the U.K. is that all the policies of the major insurance companies that we've looked at, all have, in their policy language, the ability to use these alternative parts. So it's going to be a long slog to get this through and get the insurance companies comfortable. But every quarter, we see more and more acceptance, and the growth has just been really, really strong. The second half of your question, about the competitive environment in the U.K. As you know, as we mentioned on the call, one of our largest competitors did go into receivership, they went into mensuration last week. We are currently looking at the various sites that were shuttered in the process and looking to see if we can find geographic holes to fill in our market and expand our distribution network. There are many trained, very talented employees now in the marketplace, and we are looking at opportunities to hire as many of those people as possible. And I think we're very well positioned to inherit a lot of that revenue that they had over there. We are 1 of 2 national companies now left on the marketplace. So we're going after the national accounts. And, again, looking to fill in the geographical holes. As I mentioned in my presentation, we added 20 locations this year, it puts us at 165. Our goal was always about 200. We will look to maybe acquire some of those so we don't have to greenfield those, and that's what we're looking at right now. So we're actively looking at opportunities in the marketplace. But we think it's a great opportunity for us to expand our strength in the U.K. market.","John S. Quinn","And Jamie, just to supplement what Rob said a little bit. In terms of the collision business, the company Rob's referring to is called Unipart Automotive. They did not distribute body panels. They did a little bit of collision work in terms of lighting and that sort of thing. But in terms of the mechanical market, great opportunity for us and I don't think it's really going to impact our -- the cadence of the acceptance of collision parts, particularly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question, and I apologize if I missed this, I jumped on a couple of minutes late here. But Rob, I think you mentioned that wholesale vehicle purchases were down, I think, 2% in the quarter, and I believe on a year-over-year basis. Can you just give a little color on that? Was that supply related, pricing related? What were the kind of drivers behind that?","Robert L. Wagman","The main reason, John, was that we had a really healthy backlog coming out of Q1. With the nasty winter weather we had, the auctions were quite plentiful of salvage. So we did stock up quite heavily in Q1. Year-over-year, we are ahead of where we were for the 6 months to 6 months. So we have enough product in the backlog to continue to hit our salvage numbers.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. Next, you guys made a couple of nice paint distribution acquisitions in the quarter. Could you just remind us -- or can you just kind of size that market opportunity in North America and Europe and maybe give us an idea of how the returns on the paint business compared to kind of corporate average?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, the market opportunity is pretty big here in the United States. It's well over $2 billion marketplace. We're #2 in North America. Finish Master would be the largest. We're a close second now, we've been gaining on them and looking at opportunities to continue to fill in that network. So you'll see more acquisitions in the paint business here in North America. As far as the U.K., we are by far the #1 distributor of paint at this point with locations throughout the U.K. John, you want to comment on the impact?","John S. Quinn","Yes, it tends to be a little lower gross margin business, John, but -- and we believe we get that back on an ROIC basis due, typically, you're just holding inventory prior to it being distributed on our own vehicles. I think the example we've always pointed to is back when we did the AkzoNobel acquisition and we bought 40 of their locations, and a little over 30 of them ended up in our existing locations. And so from an ROIC point of view, I think that they're quite attractive, but they are a little bit lower gross margin businesses. And you heard us refer to that, some of the gross margin deterioration year-over-year is just a result of the acquisitions in August last year associated with the U.K. paint deals.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. If I could just sneak one last one here. The Chrysler agreement that you guys reached, if I remember correctly, was only pertaining to very few parts. I mean, is there an opportunity to broaden that relationship with Chrysler over time?","Robert L. Wagman","There is, John. And by the way, the initial lawsuit that they posed against us was for one vehicle. They have several vehicles, actually, in the patent process, so it's bigger than just the one vehicle that was mentioned in the initial lawsuit. So it is settled, and I do believe it's a got a great opportunity because, of course, they always are continuing to patent parts so -- going forward. So that will continue to grow year-over-year. As you've seen in our Ford agreement, every year we seem to get a little more traction in that program, and I expect the same will happen with Chrysler.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to go back to the European landscape a little bit and I was just wondering if you could update us on the mechanical side, what the aftermarket parts penetration is. And you mentioned that you're now 1 of 2 national suppliers there. If you could talk about just the competitive landscape in terms of how fragmented that is, just kind of trying to frame the opportunity with Unipart kind of having their struggles like in terms of the market share that you might be able to pick up.","Robert L. Wagman","Sure. In terms of the mechanical penetration there, Nate, we believe in the United States is roughly 80%. We are -- back-of-the-envelope calculations that -- we've got various sources over there -- somewhere between 50% and 60% penetration of the aftermarket. The OEs had a much stronger foothold there. That has been eroding though, with the passage of the Block Exemption Rule, about 4 years ago, which basically prohibited the OEs from voiding warranty if you put market products on. So we expect the aftermarket marketplace to continue to gain market share from the OEs. In terms of what's the opportunity, we know Unipart roughly had about $225 million worth of business. They had 160 branches. All of those branches were closed. We think there's a great opportunity, especially from a national accounts perspective, to be able to go after that business that they had. I believe roughly 40% of their business was national accounts. And that is really up for grabs and, like I said, which one of the other -- there's only LKQ or Euro Car Parts and another competitor that can possibly get that business. So we're actively going after that. This just happened a week ago, so we're actively pursuing those opportunities as we speak.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of going back to, like North America, obviously, the organic numbers were well within your range and also up against the tough comps. What are we kind of looking for going forward in terms of the sustainability of that 5% to 7% organic growth in terms of just the dynamics for the rest of the year? I know you mentioned some of the seasonality that you're going to get out of the specialty business, but if you look at just the kind of collision opportunity, how should we feel about that?","Robert L. Wagman","I feel very good about our North American organic growth rate of 5% to 7%. John mentioned in his presentation about the SAAR rate and the continued advantages we have there. That will start to flow through here in the next year, at the latest. We'll start seeing some of those benefits relative to newer car parts. So I'm very confident in that 5% to 7% range. And with KAO, KAO was actually up 11% year-over-year. Even though it's not our [indiscernible] numbers, that bodes well for us that the new cars are starting to get to the marketplace, and as those cars get in accidents, that will definitely be a positive for us. So, feel very confident in the 5% to 7%, certainly long term as those new cars get into the system, but even short term, I think we're pretty good there.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last quick big -- kind of big picture thing, but a lot of people are starting to talk about these accident avoidance systems and whether or not they might actually have any impact, just wanted to see what kind of your big picture thoughts on that might be and whether you guys have done any research there in terms of whether they do make a difference.","Robert L. Wagman","We have done that research. In fact, John and I had a meeting this week with CCC. We get a quarterly update on what they're seeing in the market. And they gave us an updated chart here. And they are standing by the fact that in 20 years, we should see a reduction of 5% in accident claims, 20 years from now. 5 years, it's predicted to be about 2.5%. So very little impact they're predicting over the coming years. The example we always use, Nate, was the anti-lock brakes that became a requirement somewhere around 1996. Took until about 2011 before 80% of the cars actually had them. So there's a long cycle time to work out the older cars. So we think, comfortably, this 15 to 20 years of very little impact on the accident-avoidance systems.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Robert W. Baird.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On Keystone Automotive, the specialty parts business, John, you indicated that was significantly above trend at 11%. Can you explain what's driving that? Is there a market dynamic or something more specific to Keystone?","John S. Quinn","I think there is a little bit of a market dynamic. That company does benefit from new car production. When we look at their SAAR rate, it is up slightly year-over-year, I don't know it's up enough to drive that whole 11%. I'd like to think that some of it is the fact that we are -- we believe we're improving the service with the additional point distribution -- point, so to speak. We're also investing in that business, we're opening a new warehouse in Texas in the fall. So I don't know if it's anything unique. Rob, do you have a view?","Robert L. Wagman","I absolutely believe, Craig, what John said is right. Those 36 additional distribution points have been really critical. We're using existing LKQ facilities, so there's no additional costs and we're getting the parts to our customers even quicker. And we're starting the process, starting to share deliveries now as well. So we see that as a win-win. Customers will get the product faster. We'll continue to get additional costs out of those businesses going forward. So that's long term. We've got to get those routes all combined, but I am convinced that those extra drop points are really a key, a benefit for us to get customers more sticky with us in terms of them wanting to buy from us.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So as the balance of the year unfolds and you have the benefit of those additional distribution points, do you think we'll see 3 more quarters of sort of above-trend growth in that business?","Robert L. Wagman","I'll comment through June -- up to July, I mean, they're having a very good July as well. I think we're going to see continued growth there, strong growth. We originally -- when we announced the deal, we thought we'd grow North American 5% to 7%, I think you'll see strong growth. We'll be at the high end of that range, if not higher, I feel pretty confident going forward.","Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's great. And then on Sator, I think you mentioned some contraction in their core business. Could you just spend a little more time explaining the dynamics affecting that? And then also maybe inject how you think the 5 jobber acquisitions are going to play in that overall equation?","Robert L. Wagman","Sure. There are a couple of things, Craig, on the Sator organic. Mainly, I think the most important ones is we did buy our 5 best customers, and that revenue went from organic to intercompany. Even though the deal didn't close until May, it was announced in April for the competition commission to get involved. So it was basically the whole quarter. And I'm -- what's hard to really quantify, we're pretty certain some of the remaining customers likely moved a portion of their spend elsewhere. If another competitor had the product, they didn't want to spend it with us. There was no mass leaving of customers, but we believe that their spend likely was diversified outside of LKQ. A little bit of an impact with the export business. We had a pretty decent excellent export business into Russia and the Ukraine. That, obviously, had a little bit of an impact with the political disruption in those markets. It was a mild winter in Europe, which didn't help our Q2. So I think all those factors combined a little bit to drive down the organic growth. The 5 locations that we did buy are performing to plan. It's been a couple of months since we've had them under our belt, but they are performing to our performer expectations. And customers are seeing better fill rates with us. Obviously, we're selling more of our products into those customers we bought. So we're very happy with that progress of the 5 locations we bought. We are looking, obviously, as we mentioned on the last call, Craig, that those are 52 locations. We think the optimum number is 75. So we'll look to buy a few more acquisitions in that marketplace to fill up the market and cover the entire Netherlands. So -- and finally, on that, we did pro forma a decrease in growth with those 5 acquisitions because we knew some of our customers would likely look for alternative sources. So all in all, it's expected, and we think with the 5, now we can start to drive the organic growth as we get more comfortable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lawrence with Stephens.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","You guys mentioned and talked about the -- that basically, John, you said that some of the margin improvement in the U.S. business is being masked by some of the other noise. Can you talk a little bit about what's causing that? Obviously, you get that kind of organic growth from North America, and we can understand why we get part of it. But obviously, that number is trending better probably than you expected.","John S. Quinn","Yes, I think the point I was trying to make was that, obviously, the bigger driver that changed the margins has been the acquisitions, and those are masking the overall improvement. And we had about a 70 basis point improvement in North America. The other point I was trying to make was that because other revenue is becoming -- is shrinking relative to the rest of the size of the business, that's masking the leverage that we're getting out of the SG&A and the distribution network a little bit. Because if you look at those numbers, they're coming down as a total percent of revenue as well in many cases. But had we kept that other revenue higher simply because of commodity prices being higher, you would have seen those come down much more. The fact that we're compensating for that drop in other revenue is masking a little bit of the improvement in the operating leverage that we're getting in the base business. That was the point I was trying to make, John.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes, right. And just one more point there. The 70 basis points in North America is just primarily leveraged from that organic growth?","John S. Quinn","It's a little bit of a gross margin improvement on -- particularly, this quarter, we saw our self-serve and our aftermarket businesses taking a little bit of an uptick and then it's just that down below the gross margin line is just leveraged throughout the entire network.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And last question. If you look forward and just trying to think about the puts and takes on margin pressure, how is it -- Rob, you mentioned on the Specialty business, that should be more of just flow-through of the business rather than a change in gross margin mix that will change anything on the gross margin line. Is that right?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, that business -- the Specialty business is a lower gross margin, John, so as we gain market share and grow the business, it will be a slight deterioration on our overall gross margin as they continue to outperform.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","But it should not -- overall, the mix there shouldn't change either way, really, up or down as far as where we could see gross margin there?","Robert L. Wagman","I think it's minimal on the grants, de minimis on the grants, on the overall company performance. But it is slightly margin dilutive, that business.","John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And then, secondly, as we go to Europe, obviously, the -- as you wind through and continue to add and move from 3-step to 2-step, that helps Sator. And then I assume the next round of revenue growth, and with the ECP branches, could come in at a little lower of cost based of -- if you pick something up from Unipart.","John S. Quinn","Yes, I think that's right, John. A couple of things on the 3, 2 -- excuse me, the Netherlands acquisitions. The -- initially, we have to defer the intercompany revenue profit on -- associated with those sales. And so -- and once we get those fully integrated and get an inventory turn in there, you'll start to see a little bit of improvement in the Sator margins. ECP has opened 20 branches this year, they've incurred some of those costs in the first half of the year. As we've said before, those branches take a little while to get profitable. So I would anticipate the margins in the U.K. coming up over time as those branches expand and as they take advantage of, hopefully, our revenue part [ph] associated with that and the bankruptcy of Unipart.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Armstrong with CL King & Associates.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on Sator, with the Netherlands acquisitions, is there a risk of further customer loss going forward? Or do you think you've already realized it all?","Robert L. Wagman","I think it's been realized, Bill. I think the good customer defections would have been gone by now. I'd say, I think it's probably losing -- they're losing a little bit of their spend, but we haven't lost a significant customer through this process.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in North America, on salvaged vehicles, can you just comment on the pricing trends at the auctions and also what sort of volumes or availability of vehicles you're seeing at the auctions?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, the auctions have been very steady, Bill. We haven't seen a huge spike out of -- from all that winter weather. So we track the number of vehicles that we see at the auctions and very, very steady. As far as our cost, it is slightly up year-over-year. However, that is almost by plan because we're actually trying to buy a better car to fulfill our needs. So slight increase in the car cost, but pretty much the plan. As I said, nice backlog at our facilities, and the auctions have been very, very steady. One thing I do want to talk about a little bit about is on the scrap impact as it relates to that. We were down year-over-year, about $10 a ton and, sequentially, we were down $9 a ton. And we see a slight uptick in July. So we've seen a little bit -- at least the bottom seems to have hit there. But year-to-date, we lost about $0.01 of EPS due to the scrap being down over the course of the year. So hopefully, that stabilizes and we don't lose any more on the scrap line.","William R. Armstrong - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. And if we adjust for the mix, I know you're going after maybe a little bit better quality vehicle. Just kind of on a more apples-to-apples basis, are you seeing pricing kind of steady? Or do you think it's increasing on an apples-to-apples basis also?","Robert L. Wagman","Actually, it's pretty steady, but the Manheim year-to-date -- actually, year-over-year, is up about 3.6%, so that's remaining high. Everyone we've heard talk about that seems to think that has to be the end of it. It's going to start coming down because of the SAAR rate, but auction prices happen to be pretty steady.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. First off, you mentioned that the Keystone business was dilutive to gross margin. At least in this quarter, it seemed like it was nicely accretive to EBITDA margin at 13%, which is higher, I think, at least than we were pegging it. How sustainable is that 13% EBITDA margin in and of itself?","John S. Quinn","There is a seasonality to that business, I think Q2 is probably their strongest quarter. Obviously, we haven't owned the business for -- a little over 6 months. So -- but we anticipate that Q4 is probably going to be softer on that.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a couple of more quick questions, if I could. The acquired businesses that you acquired in the quarter outside of distributors in the Netherlands, what's a ballpark sales base on an annualized basis for those?","John S. Quinn","Well, the total, including the Sator piece, is $220 million. And in the quarter -- that equates about $55 million per quarter. In the quarter, we reported $25 million, so you can anticipate about $30 million on average, again, taking out seasonality. But we should have a $30 million revenue still to come on a quarterly basis.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I think so. And then the last question I would have. Rob, as it relates to the U.K. pilot, the insurance company pilot for collision parts, how should we think about a time frame in terms of it switching from a pilot to a full commitment on their behalf? I mean, are there certain mile posts that have been voiced to you? Or how should we define the success of the program and its gestation period?","Robert L. Wagman","Sure. Sam, I kind of wish we never used the word pilot because it obviously signifies that it's a test. The fact that no insurance company -- we launched this back in March of 2012, has stopped writing the product. I believe it's just a word that we probably regret using. We are in full-status program with these guys. Again, just taking away the word pilot. The growth that -- double-digit strong, 33% this quarter off a mild winter, I think we can continue to see those programs last. I would say we're over the hump right now with most of the carriers on the uneasiness about using these parts. Everyone has been committed to the program, and no one is showing any signs of taking back with their stance on the aftermarket parts.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Is there a tipping point coming from the aftermarket parts manufacturers then, in terms of them committing a product for you to inventory then?","Robert L. Wagman","The nice part about this, Sam, is they're the exact same manufacturers for us here in North America, so we have them fully committed to putting more certified parts into the program, both here and the north -- and in the U.K. In fact, we had an increase of certified parts of 33% here in North America. So no issues at all with our manufacturers whatsoever.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","My questions have been answered, but I was going to ask about buying these Sator distributors and what it was going to eventually do to your margins. But I think, John, you kind of answered it. You said it's up a smidge over time?","John S. Quinn","Yes, I think so. Basically, we were making a profit selling to the distributors, distributors were making a profit, so you've got -- once you eliminate that intercompany revenue, ultimately, we anticipate a slight uptick in the gross margins. We had to defer the profit on the intercompany sales until we get a turn in inventory. So we didn't get much benefit from that in Q2, probably won't get much benefit in Q3, start to see a little bit better improvement in Q4.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Rob, with your business, I remember in Q1, you said it was definitely impacted by weather. There was a lot of backlog in the collision repair facilities. I mean, how much did that really benefit you in Q2? And has that -- I would assume at this point, that, that's equilibrialized.","Robert L. Wagman","It's certainly helped, Gary, there was definitely a backlog going into Q2. We're in constant contact with our customers. They still feel that there's work in the field, whether that's late in the winter or now it's the hailstorms or just normal conditions. But volume's been pretty good through July. We're very pleased with the amount of locked work at the shops.","Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, lastly, John, you were talking about the changes in seasonality for -- based on Europe. So that would mean Q3, based on that seasonality, will be stronger than it historically has been, and Q4 would be less strong than it historically has been. Is that how I should read that?","John S. Quinn","If you look back many years ago, our strongest quarters tend to be Q1, followed by Q4. The point I was trying to make, I think, was with the European businesses, Q4 tends to be a little bit lighter than, say, Q2. And the Keystone automotive business, there's a lot of recreational associated -- especially with people who want to enhance their vehicles. But a lot of that tends to take place in the summer months. So we're anticipating a little step-down in the Keystone automotive in Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Stember with Sidoti & Company.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Rob, you indicated that the Keystone Specialty operations is now offering 1,000 SKUs of collision parts nature. Could you maybe just talk about how that's been received, how those are moving and, specifically, what kind of parts those are?","Robert L. Wagman","Yes, it's really early days, Scott. We just got all the systems communicating with each other, so the reps on both sides can see the product. It's mainly cooling products at this point, radiators, condensers, that stuff that goes into those specialty shops as well. But very pleased to have that inventory there. They actually -- I think the big potential win here will be the muscle car. Those specialty shops do tend to work on those type of vehicles, and those 20,000 SKUs of the Goodmark muscle car parts, that opens up a new opportunity to move that. It's not a huge market, the specialty -- muscle car market, but we have a nice line to be able to go after those customers now. So early days, but the communication is going back and forth and the products are flowing. And again, with 36 of their locations now -- LKQ locations as their drop point, much easier to get to them to as well.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And just moving over to Europe. Now that you've had relationships with several big carriers in the U.K. for -- going on over a year now, can you talk about any success with driving the collision parts program in the continent?","Robert L. Wagman","We've done nothing yet. At this point, Scott, our plan was to get the 3 to 2 the companies -- Sator companies under -- through the consolidation process. We are working on that. But I believe, by Q4, we'll start putting some insurance marketing people over there. And hopefully, by Q1 of next year, we should be able to launch a program over there with parts.","Scott L. Stember - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And just last question on -- can you just give an update on CCC ONE and how that's going, where you stand with that?","Robert L. Wagman","Sure. Sequentially, we had a 15% growth in orders and a 14% growth in dollars and they've over 4,200 shops enrolled at this point. So slow but steady, but still growing. And salvage will be in pilot, so that they'll be able to order salvage in Q4 with a rollout in Q1 of 2015. So moving ahead very nicely.","We want to be courteous of your time, so we'll wrap up here. Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning, and we look forward to speaking to you in October when we report our third quarter 2014 results. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your time lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."]}}
